Uh, well what would you say your opinion is on gun control?#Wh-Question
Well, I don't know.#Hedge
I've, I've had mixed emotions, I guess, when I listen to, uh, the radio and, and watch T V about the different, uh, things that are happening.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I'm against it#Statement-non-opinion
but on the same token, uh, I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to do that#Statement-non-opinion
Ye-,#Uninterpretable
So I, I have a rifle in the house.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, the ammunition is probably so old I'm afraid to use it.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, I bought it for target practicing and, uh, and also because I wanted a weapon.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, how do you feel about it?#Open-Question
Well, I think, uh, down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns.#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
And, I think they need that.#Statement-opinion
Uh, and I do have a, I have a pistol.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a little twenty-two#Statement-non-opinion
and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
An-, you know, I do like to have my guns.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Uh, I don't know if I'll ever use it, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
And like you, my bullets to my little pistol's probably, uh, about three years old#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I like to have them where handy.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, up, uh, up in New England where I'm from, uh, you had to get a permit before you could buy any amu-, am-, ammunition.#Statement-non-opinion
And I thought that was really good.#Statement-opinion
And I think if they, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
takes two weeks for that system to process, uh, your request for, uh, not as a gun permit but, uh, but to buy ammunition.#Statement-non-opinion
You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that.#Statement-non-opinion
I've never heard of anything like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah. Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That would be nice.#Statement-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
a-, you know,#Other
the criminals that are going to get their guns one#Statement-opinion
I#Agree/Accept
way or the other.#Other
I, I agree.#Other
I think, you know, one of the things that, that, that needs to happen is, uh, to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, buying it quickly and, and, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it.#Other
But if someone's really determined to, to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
And you can get them really cheap.#Statement-opinion
I know#Agree/Accept
I, I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in, uh, Tennessee.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, they had a waiting period#Other
and, uh, we bought it there.#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Uninterpretable
How long was the waiting period out there?#Wh-Question
About nine days.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
That wasn't too, too bad.#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
No#Agree/Accept
Because if, if you're going to go buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, I think you, you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it.#Statement-opinion
You're not going to react that quickly.#Statement-opinion
In other words, you know, you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day.#Statement-opinion
Th-,#Uninterpretable
somebody wants to do that,#Statement-opinion
I, I, at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I do too. Uh, because it doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, I suppose.#Statement-opinion
They both do the same kind of job.#Statement-non-opinion
A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does.#Statement-opinion
Uh, yeah.#Maybe/Accept-part
I suppose.#Maybe/Accept-part
I never got shot with either one.#Statement-non-opinion
But I don't know, uh,#Hedge
I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
a shotgun's got too much of a spread.#Statement-opinion
Or at#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
least ours does.#Other
Uh, it's, you know,#Uninterpretable
you have a little, uh, thing on the bo-, bottom of th-, on top of the barrel#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where you, you turn it,#Other
you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the spread changes.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I've got a manual single shot#Statement-non-opinion
and I guess it doesn't have any, any automatic features to it.#Statement-non-opinion
The further away I get, the, the, uh, wider the shot gets#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
from the target.#Other
And the closer that I get, the tighter that it gets.#Statement-non-opinion
It's got a hell of a kick to it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My husband had a, uh, a police gun at one time.#Statement-non-opinion
And I shot that thing one time.#Statement-non-opinion
Almost knocked me down.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And it just a li-,#Uninterpretable
I don-, I forget,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it was a three fifty-seven.#Statement-opinion
I'm not sure.#Hedge
Do you belong to a gun club or you?#Or-Clause
He belonged to one awhile back.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, since we moved,#Statement-non-opinion
we've only been here in Texas for about a year#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, we can't even find a place to shoot. Just for#Statement-non-opinion
No kidding.#Appreciation
target practice.#Other
I'd love to get used to that shotgun.#Statement-non-opinion
We traded his pistol for that shotgun.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh. Well the, the, uh, clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, it's well worth it.#Statement-opinion
You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have, uh, competition.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I've never really joined a club because I haven't got the time. Not because I haven't got the desire.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, there's an annual membership fee, uh, that's, that's fairly high.#Statement-non-opinion
Plus there's ini-, an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time, uh, uh, member.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club.#Statement-non-opinion
Plus you have to pay for the, the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, that's what my husband,#Statement-non-opinion
when he was in that gun club where he was doing that#Statement-non-opinion
It, you know,#Uninterpretable
he went mostly just to, uh, shoot at paper targets.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but, you know, they used speed and accuracy and all that.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that, that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose.#Statement-opinion
In fact, I'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to, uh, show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon.#Statement-opinion
That's a good,#Appreciation
I've never thought of that.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
That's a good point.#Appreciation
And, you know, it, it,#Uninterpretable
even after you wait your nine days, if you don't know how to handle it, it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive.#Statement-opinion
And you give him a license because he waited nine days.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's,#Uninterpretable
and, yeah.#Uninterpretable
He could, he could not only, uh, uh, shoot himself.#Statement-opinion
He could, he could, uh, mishandle a weapon. Leave it at home and let a child get at it.#Statement-opinion
It,#Uninterpretable
well we, uh, we was living on a navy base down in Memphis#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, this one guy decided to play, uh, lonesome cowboy or something.#Statement-non-opinion
And he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
He was fortunate.#Statement-opinion
He could, he could of hit something else#Statement-non-opinion
Well, he went tumbling down the steps along with, uh, shooting his foot almost off.#Statement-non-opinion
He broke his leg and#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
collar bone and a couple of other things I'm sure, being,#Other
.#Non-verbal
Mister Cowboy.#Other
I can't remember what the na-, the term was going around.#Statement-non-opinion
It was about four or five years ago.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But. Now, I guess that would be a good idea#Statement-opinion
About, uh, private citizens selling a weapons?#Summarize/reformulate
Like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me.#Statement-non-opinion
How do you feel about that?#Open-Question
Do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the, uh, buyer and the seller?#Yes-No-Question
And, or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system, uh,#Or-Clause
.#Non-verbal
because you own it?#Other
Uh, that's a hard one because we did that.#Hedge
But, uh, I think there ought to be some rule against it.#Statement-non-opinion
I'll, uh, you know,#Uninterpretable
the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something, the cops are going to come to you.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I-, isn't#Yes-No-Question
Uh,#Uninterpretable
there a way to, uh, to deregister yourself after you register a gun?#Other
I have no idea.#Other answers
I've only#Statement-non-opinion
Because I#Uninterpretable
had one gun#Other
and I've kept it, you#Statement-non-opinion
have,#Other
know, the one gun that was in my name.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Is it registered?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
I-,#Uninterpretable
The, uh, the rifle that I've got is not registered,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and, uh, I don't know why I never registered it#Statement-non-opinion
but the, uh,#Uninterpretable
I don't think you have to register a shotgun#Statement-opinion
Um, I, I think it's, it's voluntary#Statement-opinion
The, uh, the,#Uninterpretable
Well, see, uh, my husband has a thing.#Statement-non-opinion
If they go to, uh, regulating, uh, all right, uh, banning guns. Pri-, pri-, pri-, private cit-, citizens#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this,#Uninterpretable
my kid is jumping on me.#Statement-non-opinion
I can't hardly talk.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
My husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Maybe/Accept-part
I guess that could happen.#Maybe/Accept-part
It's just like the, uh, the social security system#Statement-opinion
Once they, uh, they gave everybody a number#Statement-non-opinion
and now they're making you, uh, uh, get one at, at birth.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
once they have your number, they have your identification.#Other
And if you try to do anything, uh, like, uh, not identify yourself to the government, they know who you are.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
And everything about you.#Collaborative Completion
And , that's true#Agree/Accept
Uh, I,#Uninterpretable
bu-, bu-, you know, they know so, how much money you make a week to, uh, probably your, uh,#Statement-opinion
my kid is banging.#Statement-non-opinion
I was seeing what they was banging on.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I've lost my train of thought.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sorry#Apology
That's all right.#Downplayer
You, you were talking about, uh, uh,#Summarize/reformulate
Oh, the Soc-,#Uninterpretable
Fed-, what the Federal government knows about people.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
They, they probably know everything from, half the time wh-, ho-, what time you go to the bathroom.#Statement-opinion
They probably do.#Agree/Accept
No,#Reject
that's that's a little bit extreme.#Statement-opinion
But they could know anything and everything about you.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, I'd like to have my gun.#Statement-non-opinion
If they go to banding, banning them, I'd lose my gun#Statement-non-opinion
but we wouldn't lose our pis-, our, uh, shotgun.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I don't, I don't, uh#Uninterpretable
Do you find it difficult picking up, uh, guns that, that are not registered?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
No.#Repeat-phrase
I don't either.#Statement-non-opinion
I can, I can buy some, uh, today if I wanted to.#Statement-non-opinion
Just#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
W-,#Uninterpretable
you know, put up the money.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you can look in the, uh, the,#Statement-non-opinion
we got a thing down here called A SHOPPER.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's a, a ho-, it's a, it's a bargain thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, you go and ever-, you know, always see guns in there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Five to seven guns a day.#Other
It comes out every Tuesday.#Statement-non-opinion
And there's, there's no waiting period on that.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
None whatsoever#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
You call,#Statement-non-opinion
we sold a refrigerator through it#Statement-non-opinion
and it took us all of twelve hours.#Statement-non-opinion
To sell the refrigerator?#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Yes answers
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know. And I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun.#Statement-opinion
Huh. And I think the Federal government is, uh, is really far away from, uh, uh, control.#Statement-opinion
I, I don't believe in, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm s-, I shouldn't probably say control.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean regulation.#Statement-non-opinion
Control is something that I wouldn't want the Federal government to have.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, but I would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well, I agree with you there.#Statement-opinion
They do have too much control over us already.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have.#Statement-non-opinion
Unfortunately, we, uh, we vote for the, the people who spend the money,#Statement-opinion
so I can't complain too much.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess so.#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
They're#Uninterpretable

So, who's your favorite team?#Wh-Question
My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers.#Statement-non-opinion
Pittsburgh?#Signal-non-understanding
You bet.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I, uh,#Uninterpretable
when John Stallworth played he was from my hometown in Alabama,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
so I kind of grabbed on to that team,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
That's pretty nice.#Appreciation
way back when.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's good.#Appreciation
I, I used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain,#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
or steel curtain.#Other
How about your favorite team?#Wh-Question
Huh.#Uninterpretable
Well, last year it was Buffalo#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just, they just impressed me as being so efficient#Statement-non-opinion
and they never score.#Statement-non-opinion
They never blow out their opponents.#Statement-non-opinion
They just score just enough points,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that really impressed me.#Statement-non-opinion
But then down here I li-,#Uninterpretable
is pretty close to New Orleans#Statement-non-opinion
and I've been keeping up with the Saints a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they are exciting, aren't they?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
the Saints are starting to impress me this year, you know, a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Boy,#Appreciation
they are, they are just a fun team to watch.#Statement-opinion
This, it, they are really.#Agree/Accept
Did you see the game Sunday night or,#Yes-No-Question
Uh,#No answers
Sunday afternoon?#Other
no,#Other
I didn't.#Statement-non-opinion
It was funny.#Statement-opinion
There were, they ha-, uh, a fireworks display at halftime.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you're kidding#Appreciation
So, they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my gos-,#Appreciation
and put out this fire.#Other
Those big piece of something came flaming, falling out of the roof and landed on the field#Statement-non-opinion
so there's this big fire on the field#Statement-non-opinion
and they were dumping the Gatorade bucket and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I can't believe that.#Appreciation
It was funn-,#Statement-opinion
I mean, you just really can't tell what's going to happen.#Statement-opinion
That's hilarious.#Appreciation
I know.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And Morton Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it, it was beautiful, right down the middle.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, boy.#Appreciation
He is tough,#Statement-opinion

Well, do you think they're, they're going to be able to make it this year,#Yes-No-Question
Uh I s-,#Statement-non-opinion
past the first playoff game?#Other
I sure hope so.#Other
I'm not sure, I'm not sure who they play.#Statement-non-opinion
Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams.#Statement-non-opinion
Who's that?#Wh-Question
It's pretty much going between Washington. They are undefeated.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, Buffalo, New Orleans, and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice#Other
and one of those was to Buffalo.#Statement-non-opinion
And they beat the Saints.#Statement-non-opinion
Their only time they lost.#Statement-non-opinion
What do you think about, uh, Houston?#Open-Question
Houston.#Repeat-phrase
I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis.#Hold before answer/agreement
Oh, yeah?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
Uh, from what I saw they were playing,#Statement-opinion
when I was at the game we sat right on the front row,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
right behind the Houston Oilers,#Other
and from what I saw the game Houston, Houston impressed me a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But my brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night,#Statement-non-opinion
and if that was an off night I'd hate to see when he's on a good night.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he's#Statement-opinion
He's,#Uninterpretable
he definitely, uh, is one of the best I think.#Other

the, their, their backfield is really impressive.#Statement-opinion
Haywood Jeffreys and Drew Hill#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and Allen ,#Other
they really impress me.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they squeaked out a game on Sunday.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Who, who did they play?#Wh-Question
They played Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
Dallas,#Repeat-phrase
that's right,#Agree/Accept
They won,#Statement-non-opinion
all because,#Uninterpretable
in overtime.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
I remember that now.#Statement-non-opinion
So that was,#Uninterpretable
I, I watched that game#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, that was, uh,#Uninterpretable
Do you have a favorite between those two?#Yes-No-Question
Well, because I'm right here in Dallas I, I kind of pull for Dallas.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
Well, also Houston is, uh, in Pittsburgh's division#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's true.#Agree/Accept
I'll almost always root against them.#Other
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
I hate to say it#Hedge
but I hate Dallas#Statement-non-opinion
That's okay#Statement-opinion
Well I, you know, I, I was never really a big Dallas fan#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
until we moved here#Other
and they just kind of grew on me.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I imagine.#Statement-opinion
That's the way,#Uninterpretable
I've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they've actually started doing something.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I've actually pl-, paid attention to them.#Statement-non-opinion
Well#Uninterpretable
Well, do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in?#Yes-No-Question
To tell you the truth I haven't paid too much attention to that.#Hold before answer/agreement
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Um, what cities are they looking at?#Wh-Question
Uh, right now I think this Memphis, they're, they're trying to get the teams.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's, that's where I was when I saw, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Houston play.#Other
Saint Louis is trying to get a team.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, Baltimore is trying to get a team,#Statement-non-opinion
and there's some other city.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm wanting to say Raleigh Durham#Statement-opinion
but I'm not sure.#Hedge
You know, I think you are right.#Agree/Accept
I think it is Raleigh.#Statement-opinion
Think so?#Backchannel in question form
I think I remember hearing that.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I know they've got a football team#Statement-non-opinion
but I think it might be them.#Statement-opinion
That would be fun.#Statement-opinion
I'd like to see some more teams get in.#Statement-non-opinion
I would, definitely.#Agree/Accept
I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after.#Statement-non-opinion
And right now I think Memphis and, it's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis#Statement-non-opinion
and when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
It's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two,#Statement-non-opinion

Well, I don't find a lot of time to watch T V.#Statement-non-opinion

And then, um, as my kids got older and started, you know, recognizing what was going on, I thought, this isn't really very good#Statement-non-opinion
*#Appreciation
So I gave it up.#Statement-non-opinion
Ouch.#Other
Fifteen years.#Summarize/reformulate

Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
good.#Appreciation
That's considered a pretty good program.#Statement-non-opinion

Huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it again.#Other
But, uh, i-, it's worth it once you get it.#Statement-opinion

an, and to have enough time to spend with Matthew.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

so, um,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I understand that,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
They really grow up quick. Especially at that early age.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But my, my wife was, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
she worked part-time when my oldest was, was little#Statement-non-opinion
and now she's staying home all the time,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, that worked out really well because it's a big transition I think to have children.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, to go from, you know, nothing, you know,#Statement-opinion
if you want to do something every night that's fine,#Statement-opinion
but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore,#Statement-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
That's right,#Agree/Accept
and I think a lot of people are, um, are turning to, well, I think, I think a lot of people are realizing that#Statement-opinion
but still there are so many people that are, you know, have their careers first#Statement-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, uh, I think it's really hurting, uh, the kids, you know,#Other
but.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree with you,#Agree/Accept
I, I, I think that my wife leaned that way#Statement-opinion
and I'm really glad she did#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, I'm glad she's staying home,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, I know there are some days when she wi-,#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Agree/Accept
she wishes she was back at work.#Other
That's why I like to to, to work a couple days,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it's, uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it gives me a break.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well t-, see that's, that's why I'm glad my wife did too,#Statement-non-opinion
'cause she worked either two to thre-, three days a week#Statement-non-opinion
and that got her out of the house#Statement-non-opinion
and yet she'd get to spend, you know, three or four days with ...#Statement-non-opinion
Most of the time at home,#Summarize/reformulate
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
and so.#Uninterpretable
Uh, we had started out like that#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, I think that was really ideal, uh.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I do to,#Statement-non-opinion
I agree,#Statement-non-opinion
but then when you start having two of them, it's, you know, a little bit tougher,#Statement-opinion
It's,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because you've got to make a little more money, to make that payoff and stuff.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's difficult,#Statement-opinion
but.#Uninterpretable
Are, are you from the Maryland area?#Yes-No-Question

Well, um, I don't know,#Hedge
I, uh, we, we do a lot of things on the weekends together, the family,#Statement-non-opinion

I'm sure it does.#Appreciation
But, um, it, you know,#Uninterpretable
we take walks,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and go to the library,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and try to fill our day with things like that,#Other
but, um.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what, uh,#Uninterpretable
my wife did some teaching at like, uh, like a private tutoring place.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A Sylvan Learning Center this year#Other
and so that, that got me to sp-, to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, 'cause normally if, if they need something they just go to mom.#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No matter what it is,#Other
I mean, I cou-, I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's so much easier to go to mom,#Other
I guess they get used to it.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So,#Uninterpretable
but, you know, we'd go to the library and do things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
but#Uninterpretable
That's good,#Appreciation
that's good.#Appreciation
I know my husband was real, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
in the beginning when he, uh, he was transferred to a, a larger plant#Statement-non-opinion
and he, uh, he works about an hour and a half away from here, from our home,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, so it takes him a little bit of time.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I'm not able to work during the week, uh, because of that.#Statement-non-opinion
He was, I was working in the evening,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he was coming home#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I could go to work,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
their relationship, uh, when I was able to work in the evenings, uh, really grew.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He, you know,#Uninterpretable
just the time that they were spending together,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it, it really, it really helped to have that time together.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
it really does#Statement-opinion
because I think yu-, you know, you grow closer.#Statement-opinion
Was your, uh, was your husband, I mean naturally a child,#Yes-No-Question
I mean ha-, had he been around children,#Yes-No-Question
or ...#Uninterpretable
Uh, oh yeah,#Yes answers
he has, uh, he has seven other brothers and sisters,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they have, we have thirteen grand,#Statement-non-opinion
well his parents have thirteen grandchildren.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's, uh, you know, there's a lot of kids in the family#Statement-non-opinion
and, and he really enjoys it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, right now it's kind of a difficult time,#Statement-non-opinion
but ...#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and the cost of living here is just so tremendously, you know, outrageous#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, it's difficult, uh, to do it any other way.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I understand.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm, I, you know#Uninterpretable
it's, it's hard because, you know,#Statement-opinion
then you're not getting to spend as much time with, at home,#Summarize/reformulate
I mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to.#Summarize/reformulate
That's right.#Agree/Accept
So, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that that's a tough situation,#Statement-opinion
but then, then again, you know, some,#Uninterpretable
you got to do what you got to do,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know to get along, too,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at least, I, I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home#Statement-opinion
It, uh,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we-, well like I said my wife normally feels that way,#Statement-non-opinion
there are days when, uh, I come home and she says here take these kids,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm getting out.#Quotation
I know#Appreciation
So she's, she's had about enough during those days,#Statement-non-opinion
but.#Statement-opinion
I know.#Appreciation
But, for the most part, I, you know, I've really feel like that's led,#Other
the way that, you know, we-, jus-,#Uninterpretable
like what you said with the cost of living and everything, I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and won't.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so I think that's le-, tended to lead to a decline in, in families and family values especially.#Statement-opinion
Oh yeah,#Agree/Accept
it has.#Statement-opinion
And I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that, you know, we need to do something about,#Statement-opinion
but I don't know what.#Statement-non-opinion
I believe that too,#Agree/Accept
and I think, uh, the kids are where they need to, you know,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they need to really focus on the children in the wor-, in this country.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Would, would you have said that a couple of years ago, do you think?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I didn't, I didn't even really think about it that much, I mean, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I was aware, vaguely aware of it,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, I didn't it wasn't really that important to me,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, ...#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child.#Statement-opinion
Oh, it, it really does,#Agree/Accept
I,#Uninterpretable
just the whole, uh, you know,#Uninterpretable
seeing how you really are cre-, are, are forming this,#Summarize/reformulate
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
you know, the mind#Other
Well, you know, in the next year or so, you'll see so many instances where, you know, he'll mimic something that you've done,#Statement-non-opinion
and you see, you know, everything I'm doing, he's learning from.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
And, and, you think, if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, th-, that's how they're developing their patterns.#Statement-opinion
And I think a lot of people either, don't care, or don't realize it, you know.#Statement-opinion
That's,#Uninterpretable
Or, or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I, I've seen a lot of people just say well, you know, he'll learn everything when he gets into,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
eventually.#Collaborative Completion
uh, you know,#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's true.#Statement-opinion
but it, um,#Uninterpretable
I, I know,#Statement-non-opinion
even just this first year, that I've been with, uh, my son, h-, here, um, he's,#Statement-non-opinion
I can just see how much,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of, of a difference it makes staying home with him,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
instead of, uh, ,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
plus, plus I think it becomes part of y-, part of you too,#Statement-opinion
I mean, you get to stay home,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it's not just for him,#Statement-opinion
but it's also for you, because you're both kind of bonding together there too, I think,#Statement-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Statement-opinion
Well it's been nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Well it's nice talking to you, too.#Conventional-closing
Okay#Conventional-closing
good luck.#Conventional-closing

I started when I was in college.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, they always offer credit cards for college students.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I went ahead, and accepted every one that I was offered.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I p-, I pack around a lot of them,#Statement-non-opinion
but I only use a few of them.#Statement-non-opinion
You have a lot of discipline.#Statement-opinion
They make it really easy for people to, uh, to get credit cards, especially college students.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have, uh, two daughters who, who both are in college#Statement-non-opinion
or, in fact, one has finished now.#Statement-non-opinion
But they both have a lot of credit cards.#Statement-non-opinion
And they give you such high credit limits.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, it's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then they, they give you, uh, uh, the credit limit,#Statement-non-opinion
and then you're always s-, seemingly up to that limit.#Statement-non-opinion
Now I have quite a few credit cards that I'm always almost up to the limit on most of them.#Statement-non-opinion
And that's, that's how a lot of people get into trouble.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've got, I've got two that I, you know, that usually I'll have a balance on.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then all of the others I just try to use kind of like you would an American Express card and, and pay it off every month.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that way I feel like I'm getting, you know, a thirty day loan.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I don't have to worry about, you know, running them up too high, except at Christmas.#Statement-non-opinion
Then they usually go, then they usually get run up pretty good.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you have a lot of discipline.#Statement-opinion
I, uh, I'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I've, I've paid off about four credit cards this year.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, but still I have some that are, are up to the limit.#Statement-non-opinion
And especially the Visa Card#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you can go and get cash on#Other
.#Non-verbal
And it seems like every time I'm short of cash, I just go get, get it from Visa.#Statement-non-opinion
Now that's one, that's#Uninterpretable
I've never used my Visa for cash before.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Can you use it like at a bank machine#Declarative Yes-No-Question
j-,#Uninterpretable
Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or,#Uninterpretable
Well, uh, you can go in a bank and just hand them the Visa Card and say, "I want a cash advance."#Statement-non-opinion
Or if they've sent you a, uh, a number that you can use. You know, a, a personal identification number#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you can use in the, uh, impact machines or whatever, you,#Other
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
you can do that.#Other
Because I have one that I don't have a pin number for.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, sometimes you have to ask them for that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then I have one that, uh, just gave me the pin number automatically.#Statement-non-opinion
Now we got,#Statement-non-opinion
that's, that's funny you said that. Because we got a credit card, uh, my husband and I got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Now a couple of weeks later we got, we got pin numbers,#Statement-non-opinion
and then we got, uh, a bill saying, you know, uh, the yearly fee, it was like forty dollars.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we, we cut them up and sent them back because we, we hadn't even applied for them,#Statement-non-opinion
and we didn't want them.#Statement-non-opinion
But they, they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow!#Appreciation
So I thought, man, I don't know if I trust this or not#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they, they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time.#Statement-non-opinion
Ev-, ev-, everybody in the world will offer you a, a credit card.#Statement-non-opinion
It's like, let's see if we can get her to run up her bills#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But it's hard,#Statement-opinion
I mean, it's, it's tempting when you see something to say, "Well, I'll just charge it."#Statement-non-opinion
And sometimes I'll do that,#Statement-non-opinion
but usually I, I will try to pay everything off the next month#Statement-non-opinion
or#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the ones that usually have an outstanding balance all the time, I'll, I'll pay more than the minimum payment.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just I fe-, I feel like even that little bit helps.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you know, the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that, I think we, we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible.#Statement-non-opinion
That's, that's why I've, I've really started to try to, to pay off mine and get out of debt. Because we never know when we might, you know, get laid off or#Statement-non-opinion
I know it.#Appreciation
something.#Other
Especially me.#Statement-non-opinion
I work for Texas Instruments,#Statement-non-opinion
and they've had, had a lot of, of, uh, you know, layoffs lately.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I work for T I too.#Statement-non-opinion
You do?#Backchannel in question form
And I think they're getting ready to, to probably sell us out, our division.#Statement-non-opinion
Where are you?#Wh-Question
In Johnson City, Tennessee.#Statement-non-opinion
Johnson City,#Repeat-phrase
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
know they're selling out somebody in Colorado Springs.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They just, they just announced that, didn't they?#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Yes answers
So, I mean, it's, it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards.#Statement-opinion
It, it certainly is.#Appreciation
I've, uh, I have worked on a part, part time job, uh, where I was a collector.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
For, uh, uh, a jewelry company#Other
People, uh, that#Uninterpretable
they just had this jewelry account.#Statement-non-opinion
It was Zales jewelry, in fact.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, a whole bunch of peop-,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean they have about a thousand collectors, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
Man!#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, there's just so many people that have bought jewelry, which is really a luxury item#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then they, they just can't pay for it.#Statement-non-opinion
Something, something happens,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, and you hear so many stories listening to them. Like, uh, you know, they lost their job#Statement-non-opinion
or, uh, they, they've signed for a friend.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, they got it in their name#Statement-non-opinion
but they#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
got it for a friend#Other
and then the friend#Statement-non-opinion
Didn't pay them.#Collaborative Completion
wouldn't pay them.#Other
and now they're stuck with the bill,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's ruining their credit#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Man.#Appreciation
you really have to watch it, this you know.#Other
Because,#Uninterpretable
That's scary.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Because every, every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau, you know. Automatically, mo-, most of them do.#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't realize that.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And if you, if you're, uh,#Uninterpretable
it's bad because if you, you know, your bill is due on the fifteenth#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then i-, y-, y-, y-, you-, you're not past due until the fifteenth of the next month.#Other
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, you know, if you, if you pay one day after that fifteenth, you're not one day late,#Statement-non-opinion
you're thirty days late.#Statement-non-opinion
They don't, they don't recognize any time difference, do they?#Yes-No-Question
Right,#Agree/Accept
Ooh,#Appreciation
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's scary.#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
A-, a-,#Uninterpretable
and, anyway, we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of,#Statement-non-opinion
That's something I never thought about getting, you know, checking with to see what, what your credit report looked like.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you know, you, you can do that.#Statement-non-opinion
I believe it costs about ten dollars.#Statement-non-opinion
Might be worth it for peace of mind.#Appreciation
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
It is,#Statement-non-opinion
it is.#Statement-non-opinion
You might even find somebody's been reporting on you#Statement-non-opinion
and you didn't even know it.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, you, I mean you might think you're paying something on time#Statement-non-opinion
or and you, by that day#Statement-non-opinion
and you're thir-, thirty days is not real bad though anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If you've got a charge off on your credit report or something like that.#Other
That's when it really gets bad.#Statement-non-opinion
Or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days, you know. And things like that#Statement-non-opinion
I think that Discover Card has a good idea with, you know, giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you, you purchase. As long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And since they don't have the yearly fee.#Statement-non-opinion
Do they charge a lot of interest on that card?#Yes-No-Question
I don't know.#Other answers
I don't,#Uninterpretable
I've never, I haven't gotten one.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just because it's, uh, uh,#Other
I felt like with Visa and Mastercard and American Express you didn't need another one.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I would think it wouldn't be, you know, much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that, that wouldn't be too bad.#Statement-opinion
Well, always watch out for s-, anybody who bills you out of Atlanta, Georgia.#Statement-non-opinion
Or there's a couple of other places that are able to charge us like twenty-one and twenty-two percent interest.#Statement-non-opinion
I know, I had a charge with, uh, Spiegel,#Statement-non-opinion
and I hadn't read the, uh, terms of the credit agreement really.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, when I did, I, you know, I realized that, that it just looked, seemed like I was never paying the balance off,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know.#Other
And I looked at the credit card agreement one day,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was like twenty-three percent interest.#Statement-non-opinion
Holy cow!#Appreciation
And that's the one bill that I hurry up, hurried and paid up.#Statement-non-opinion
Definitely.#Appreciation
And,#Statement-non-opinion
That's awful.#Appreciation
and I've always watched it since then.#Other
You really have to watch those interest rates.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean,#Uninterpretable
I mean there's no point in giving them any more money than we have to.#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Appreciation
So,#Uninterpretable
So anyway, they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent, I think, in, in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
But#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's great.#Appreciation
there, there are a couple of states that can.#Other
And one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia.#Statement-non-opinion
I'll try to remember that one.#Offers, Options Commits
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
Well,#Uninterpretable
Well, let's see.#Hold before answer/agreement
I was trying to think if there was anything else#Hold before answer/agreement
.#Non-verbal
Uh, the, I guess the worst problem I ever had with, with a credit card though was, um, I got a, an item on my bill that I had never purchased.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork,#Statement-non-opinion
but they weren't supposed to process it until they delivered it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I changed my mind,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but then they went ahead and charged it on my account.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it took me about eighteen months to get that, all of that mess off of my account.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow!#Appreciation
So that's, that's probably the worst thing I've ever had happen with a credit card.#Statement-non-opinion
I wonder if they ...#Uninterpretable

There we go.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, uh, I think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than I would expect this time of year.#Statement-opinion
I think that's true.#Agree/Accept
The, uh, the Bermuda grass is greening up in March,#Statement-non-opinion
and sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of April.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I think we're a little hea-, ahead of schedule on that.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was out in my yard yesterday afternoon,#Statement-non-opinion
and I noticed all that grass coming up,#Statement-non-opinion
and I thought, ooh,#Statement-non-opinion
we've got to start this mowing bit soon#Quotation
That's true.#Agree/Accept
It's been a, a fun break,#Statement-non-opinion
but the break is over.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, um, oh, I guess another thing I've noticed, too, here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days, it's been awfully gray, you know, just,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now, the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it seems like every time at work I look out my window it's gray#Statement-non-opinion
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I go for that,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In fact, I'm a little worried about this one coming up here.#Statement-non-opinion
We have a long weekend#Statement-non-opinion
and, it sounds like it's going to be a little bit on the cool side.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I haven't heard whether it's going to rain or not.#Statement-non-opinion
I think there's an eighty percent chance this evening,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow#Statement-non-opinion
and then the rest will be without rain.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
But I think the highs are going to be in the sixties, and the lows in the forties.#Statement-non-opinion
That's getting back to a little bit chillier.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year.#Statement-opinion
I think,#Uninterpretable
I haven't seen the wea-, the weather on the news in the evening lately,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think the average high would be, should be about seventy.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm not certain either,#Statement-non-opinion
but you're probably right.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, uh, maybe seventy-five to eighty, somewhere in there.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't like it when it's too cool or too warm.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
Um, one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And what that tells me, is that the summer weather is very predictable, that it doesn't vary very much.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
You're probably right.#Maybe/Accept-part
I mean, any other time of year, that's not the case, because it could be very warm or very cold.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as a matter of fact, I heard the weather the other day on T V#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it was one day this week a year ago#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather. You know#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it wasn't just a super bad storm,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the, the late spring time.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
One of the weirdest things I saw, I think it was around this time last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
I, you know, I was going into the grocery store,#Statement-non-opinion
and a, a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was twenty- six degrees out.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I thought, Well gee, I've, I've never known it to lightening at that temperature.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that, that is pretty unusual.#Statement-non-opinion
And you really take notice of it, too.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
It, uh, it probably was a lot warmer up high.#Statement-opinion
Sometimes they get those inversions, like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing.#Statement-non-opinion
The air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
I don't, don't like that super cold stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Nope.#Agree/Accept
I just don't move very well when it's that cold.#Statement-non-opinion
Yep,#Agree/Accept
I, I'm really enjoying this now.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, this has been interesting.#Statement-opinion
Yeah, well.#Agree/Accept
Not too challenging to the brain.#Statement-opinion
Not, not a real in depth topic, but#Statement-opinion

And, um, I'd, I'd probably buy another, this is the first American vehicle I've owned.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I would probably purchase another one, um, I would be more selective in the dealership that I purchased it from#Statement-non-opinion
but as far as, uh, the quality seems to be there, um, it's quiet, it's, it handles well, um,#Statement-non-opinion

Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because you can't see a car ahead of you,#Statement-non-opinion
but they're fast as lightning and all that crap.#Statement-non-opinion
But the Explorer, I mean, you're sitting up on top of everything#Statement-non-opinion
and you can really see real well.#Statement-non-opinion
And I just,#Statement-non-opinion
it's so comfortable#Statement-non-opinion

So, you're,#Other
what are your feelings about American versus European cars?#Open-Question
Um, I like anything besides Japanese.#Statement-non-opinion
Of course everything has Japanese parts in them anymore.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't like Japanese cars,#Statement-non-opinion
Why not.#Wh-Question
But, uh, European, I don't ha-, have any, I mean,#Statement-non-opinion
those are the kind I usually end up liking the most.#Statement-non-opinion
American cars, a lot of people say they, they don't last long#Statement-non-opinion
but I've never had any problem with, um, my Mercury,#Statement-non-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable
my cous-,#Uninterpretable
my husband has a, uh, Cougar#Statement-non-opinion
and he's never had any problem with it either,#Statement-non-opinion

I don't know, uh, I mean, I think European cars are great, course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff#Statement-non-opinion
and they're eas-,#Statement-opinion
some, some of them are easy to work on.#Statement-opinion
A Volvo, being a four cylinder is very easy to work on.#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, excellent warranty, I mean, just, unbelievable warranty.#Statement-non-opinion
And, and, uh, of course, Ford isn't too bad.#Statement-opinion
I think Chrysler would probably make a good vehicle,#Statement-opinion
uh, but all of it has to do, in my opinion with the service.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the attitude of the service, of the dealership.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I wouldn't send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford.#Statement-non-opinion

this girl that works for me just bought a car down there#Statement-non-opinion
and sh-,#Uninterpretable
they, they had a problem with they, uh, took their Camaro in to get it traded and they, they hadn't signed any papers#Statement-non-opinion

and the people, um, wouldn't reim-, reimburse them for anything.#Statement-non-opinion
Middlekauff wouldn't?#Yes-No-Question
She needs to find herself a lawyer.#Statement-opinion

Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and I like to listen to that and catch, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't get, I don't get a lot of, uh, sometimes I don't get the current events, you know. Because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with, uh, you know, some important issue on the day.#Statement-non-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable

so, so the real, the real current news and, the hard news#Summarize/reformulate

Uh, you know, I sort of can't get enough of this.#Statement-non-opinion

and national events.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, in, in Dallas, what are the, what is the newspaper situation?#Wh-Question
Well we d-, we, we have a, a big newspaper situation.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, because, we used to have two newspapers up until, uh, last Sunday#Statement-non-opinion
and a, uh, major, uh, a, one of our major papers just closed down.#Statement-non-opinion
They closed shop, and said, well, we can't put any more papers out,#Statement-non-opinion
we're done.#Quotation
Was, was that the, the better paper#Yes-No-Question
or ,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Yes answers
I thought so.#Statement-non-opinion
It was a, it was a more effective paper as far as I was concerned.#Statement-non-opinion
It, it had, uh, uh, it got to the news, you know, and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, which I like.#Other
I don't, I don't like to, you know, I like to save the editorial information or the the politically, uh, weighted information, you know, for the, for a different section.#Statement-non-opinion
I like just to get to the, you know, find out what's happening#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
pretty quick.#Other
And I feel that the other newspaper, uh,#Uninterpretable
the T-, the DALLAS MORNING NEWS is the one that's still here.#Statement-non-opinion
The TIMES HERALD is the one that closed up#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the, the MORNING NEWS was, was, i-, is okay,#Statement-opinion
but, you know, you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as I'm concerned.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, many times it doesn't doesn't reflect my own opinion#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
But if you, if you were to look at the front page of today's MORNING NEWS#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
MORNING TIMES rather, w-, would you, would you see things about what is going on in Europe?#Other
No,#No answers
no,#No answers
that's the problem.#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
But, y-, you know, you see, you see Troy Aikman's knee surgery on the front page, you know.#Statement-opinion
Whoever Troy Aikman is.#Declarative Wh-Question

a, a quarterback for the Broncos or for the, for the Cowboys.#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah.#Yes answers
that, there is, uh, local news that, uh, that really a lot of times doesn't, doesn't change, change my life one way or the other.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh,#Uninterpretable
I guess it's current events, but not the kind of current events that changes the world.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right,#Agree/Accept
yeah#Agree/Accept
Not something you'll, you'll, uh, be interested in ten years from now by any means.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Other
How, how about you?#Open-Question
Uh, I guess in Washington, D C you guys have several papers that are pretty#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
pretty effective#Other
A lot of them.#Statement-non-opinion
don't you?#Other
I, I rather like the WASHINGTON POST.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I also get the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and, uh, each of them covers different things in, in dif-, dif-,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in different ways#Other
and so it's, you know, if I only looked at one of them I would have a different perspect-, clearly would have a different perspective on the world.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Uh, I, I have a question.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, does, does the WALL STREET JOURNAL, uh,#Yes-No-Question
I, I've kind of gathered lately that, uh, maybe their information is not just only related to business.#Statement-opinion
Is that, is that a correct assumption?#Yes-No-Question
That, that is certainly true.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, they will, they will have articles,#Statement-non-opinion
like a few days ago they had a, a nice article on Einstein, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
theory of relativity.#Other
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
You know, that started on the front page ran in, into the full, almost full page inside.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now, these are feature kind of articles.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
All the, all the, uh, you know, the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, but there is some very good other articles#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, you'll find in the, in the JOURNAL.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you find that you're, uh, uh, disappointed or pleased with, uh, uh, the performance of like network coverage of news?#Or-Clause
Uh, I wish it were in more depth.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, that doesn't mean to say longer,#Statement-non-opinion
just more facts would be nice.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, C N N has, has, you know, was, was pretty good during the war.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
definitely.#Agree/Accept
Uh, and they were, you know, sort of had a unique vantage point for, for doing that reporting.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, but, you know, it's not, it's never quite,#Uninterpretable

Well, we haven't really heard that much in the news lately, about, uh, U S involvement in Latin America, since, uh, all this Middle East crisis began.#Statement-non-opinion
So I haven't really paid that much attention like, since back in August when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on, uh, Iraq,#Statement-non-opinion
and, the, so the last thing that I remember hearing that much about is the Iran Contra scandal that happened in the Reagan presidency.#Statement-non-opinion
Can you think of anything else that's happened recently?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I would agree with you.#Statement-non-opinion
We haven't had too much,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, historically, we've always, uh, almost been like a big brother to, in, and to the Latin American area, and, uh, almost used them,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I, I, I feel.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I think something will have to be done down there very soon about, uh, about Mexico and, and, uh, some of the other areas,#Statement-opinion
but, but, with the Persian Gulf, as you said, it's just, uh, been very quiet.#Statement-opinion
I, I keep pretty close tabs on the paper#Statement-non-opinion
and you don't hardly see a,#Statement-opinion
unless it's there and we're just not seeing it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, the only, uh, references that I have seen lately has been, uh, in, part of#Statement-non-opinion
the overmilitarization of Iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things,#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they made references to in the past, how we have given arms to, uh, Nicaragua and to other places in Latin America, and that those might turn around and haunt us someday.#Other
Well that's,#Uninterpretable
I mean, not, not to this large scale as Iraq,#Statement-opinion
but that,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whenever we give arms to people, a-, as we did, and as we sold arms to, pardon me, to Iraq, when we wanted them to fight Iran,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then, uh, and then it turn around and,#Other
I, I agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world,#Statement-opinion
and so, uh, there's a lot of money to be made there,#Statement-opinion
and it's, uh, be very difficult to, to cut it back to a,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a level where it should be.#Other
And, and, uh, it will come back to haunt us,#Statement-opinion
it seems to come in cycles.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I know when I spent,#Statement-non-opinion
the time that I've studied in Mexico, uh, se-, Spanish was one of my majors in college, that, uh, there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards America,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
about, uh, like you say, using them, yo-,#Statement-opinion
our interest there is, you know, what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that we weren't normally very interested in them,#Statement-opinion
and they have,#Uninterpretable
in other, in most Latin American countries, they, there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries, you know,#Statement-opinion
that they have corruption,#Statement-opinion
and, and they don't have, uh,#Statement-opinion
I mean, there's just very few really modern cities.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the, probably the bigge-, biggest problem down there is that's where the, that's the drug entry points,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and their economy is,#Uninterpretable
of s-, several of the countries,#Uninterpretable
especially Columbia, is so built on the, on t-, on the drugs, that, uh, our, our little war on drugs has really been laughable.#Statement-opinion
It's just a, you know, such a small amount,#Statement-opinion
and it doe-,#Uninterpretable
it just,#Uninterpretable
it, uh, cuts off just a trickle,#Statement-opinion
and, uh, if, if we can't get a handle on that through some, through some, uh, method, I don't know where, whe-,#Statement-opinion
that will be another big problem.#Statement-opinion
Well, that's right,#Appreciation
because that's just so much of the way that they make their money#Statement-opinion
and so many communities have, uh, have to have that for farming#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they don't look at it so much as, you know,#Statement-opinion
And as long as we're the largest, uh, consumer, then, uh,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this is the market.#Other
That's right.#Appreciation
If we can cut back the usage, then uh, maybe it will have to go someplace else.#Statement-opinion
And I think it's really very sad that north of the border, you know, the United States and Canada is so different,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
from the S-, from South America,#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and Central America.#Other
There's really a disparity between the, uh, what a e-, I would call civilization of the countries, you know.#Statement-opinion
Right, yeah, *#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we're just so much wealthier,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, there has to be resentment built up,#Other
and that's where, uh, leaders can use, uh, use that whenever the opportune moment arises.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it's really kind of sad, and,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and, uh, Israel and the Middle East Arab countries, and, and when we have, when we have a lot of problems, r-, r-, right in our own back door.#Other
That's right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Our own hemisphere,#Summarize/reformulate
but we've,#Uninterpretable
that's been, uh, that's been the way it's always been.#Statement-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
So, uh,#Uninterpretable
So I guess we've kind of neglected Latin America.#Statement-opinion
Very much so, except when we need them.#Statement-opinion
You know when they found oil in Mexico, then we got very friendly with them again.#Statement-opinion
Ri-,#Uninterpretable
recently#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
fairly recently.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's really sad.#Statement-opinion
I hadn't thought about that in a long time.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
Well, I guess then, I will go,#Action-directive
but I,#Uninterpretable
Okay.#Agree/Accept
made me stop and think a minute about,#Statement-non-opinion
Sure did.#Appreciation
not worrying so much about the Middle East crisis.#Other
I know that it's not settled but, there are other areas that we could focus our attention on.#Statement-non-opinion
Always,#Agree/Accept
yes ma'am.#Appreciation
Well, thank you,#Conventional-closing
you have a good day.#Conventional-closing
You too, dear.#Conventional-closing

Well, how do you feel about capital punishment?#Open-Question
Well, I, I just last Friday got off a capital murder case.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you did?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
I was on the jury. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Which is funny because I got called last night#Statement-non-opinion
and the topic was, uh, something about juries#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really ?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
so I am just hitting it right.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, how do I feel about it?#Open-Question
I, I don't know.#Hedge
Well, I guess it is right in certain cases. Uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Becau-,#Uninterpretable
well, the one I was just on, I don't,#Statement-non-opinion
I was an alternate on the case,#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't know what was decided.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They are probably still in deliberations on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, what I found out,#Statement-non-opinion
once, once I was declared an alternate and I was dismissed, we met with the judge, the two alternates did.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy#Statement-non-opinion
and I remember hearing about it.#Statement-non-opinion
It was about a year ago.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, he was, he was involved in another one, another capital murder the very next month#Statement-non-opinion
and he was caught just,#Statement-non-opinion
they, they drove up,#Statement-non-opinion
the police drove up just as he fired the g-, gun and killed the guy.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
So he was caught#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it's interesting because the county I live in,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not in Dallas county,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, I'm pretty far north of Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, county I live in, in the past ten years only had t-, two capital murders.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
And last year there were six#Statement-non-opinion
and this guy is indicted on three of them.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
so#Statement-opinion
Wow#Appreciation
you have to wonder you know.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, the cases like that, they#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
should,#Other
I mean, if he's going to be drastic, somebody has to be drastic back.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
although, you know, it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him.#Statement-opinion
You know, he, he has no concept of what he has done.#Statement-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
He just, well,#Uninterpretable
from what I can tell. I mean, I didn't talk to the guy or anything,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, he doesn't seem to have any regard for anythi-, anybody's life including his own.#Other
Wow.#Appreciation
So, it's, it's kind of strange that, you know,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No, no remorse whatsoever, huh.#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
huh-uh.#No answers
Well, I guess in cases like that, you know, where the guy would, obviously, go out and do it again#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you've got to do something.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, it's funny because when, you know, they interview you before you go on the jury#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and for capital murder, I was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours.#Other
Wow.#Appreciation
And I,#Uninterpretable
the,#Uninterpretable
I was the, I think the ninety eighth person they'd interviewed.#Statement-non-opinion
You're kidding.#Appreciation
But, you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone#Statement-non-opinion
and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt#Statement-non-opinion
and I said I can't imagine,#Statement-non-opinion
I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he had done it, yeah,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess I could convict him,#Statement-non-opinion
but I can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But they really did.#Statement-non-opinion
It was, it was#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
really amazing.#Other
Well, I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
And those jurors don't know about.#Other
But this particular case, I mean, they had a complete confession from the guy#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with a lot of things that, that the police hadn't released#Other
so no one else would have known.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was, it was really pretty interesting.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
What,#Uninterpretable
Educational.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess cases like that, I don't see why they wouldn't bring in the new evidence from the other case.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they can't, they can, I think in the punishment phase#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been, he hasn't been found guilty of it.#Other
Of that crime#Collaborative Completion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but he was found guilty of anoth-,#Statement-non-opinion
okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so#Statement-non-opinion
That works.#Collaborative Completion
you know, it's, although, it's not going to take much#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to prove that.#Other
So,#Uninterpretable
Well, they pushing the death penalty?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, yeah,#Yes answers
this guy is up for the death penalty.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
Uh, and in Texas there is, there is a couple of questions you have to ask, uh, in the punishment phase.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, for example, was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation#Statement-non-opinion
And there is a number of questions#Statement-non-opinion
and just depending on whether you say yes or no, uh, you, you can give him capital punishment#Statement-non-opinion
and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment, then you can look at mitigating circumstances.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
So there is a lot of outs,#Statement-non-opinion
but the only result is, otherwise he gets life in prison.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I'm really kind of against life in prison anyway#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because it costs so dog gone much.#Other
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and to me, I mean, you take away a person's freedom, you've taken away most of their life.#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Appreciation
I mean, if you're going to put him in prison for life#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but,#Uninterpretable
with no chance for parole,#Other
But then you have to look at reality.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I think, you know, normally they, they may get out#Statement-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
That's true.#Appreciation
But what is it worth?#Backchannel in question form
I don't know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Personally I don't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself.#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Appreciation
I mean, I don't know whether I'd stay in prison or not#Statement-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, you said you're from Mississippi?#Summarize/reformulate
Yes, ma'am.#Yes answers
And do they have the death penalty there?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
they do.#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
they've had a, a number of cases here.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, not a whole lot,#Statement-non-opinion
well, Jackson, I heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was like last like year they had forty-nine#Statement-non-opinion
so that's going up.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, yeah,#Other
they have a death penalty.#Statement-non-opinion
I hear of one every now and then.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I visited the prison up here#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, at Parchman#Other
and I've been,#Uninterpretable
I haven't,#Uninterpretable
they won't let you on death row,#Statement-non-opinion
but they'll let you look down the hall.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You can't see any prisoners#Statement-non-opinion
and, and it's kind of a weird feeling.#Statement-non-opinion
I've been#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Other
they took us around on a tour, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and I went, got to walk in the gas chamber#Statement-non-opinion
Ooh.#Appreciation
and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you're sitting there saying, like, people have died here.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
But I guess, just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff, the people up there,#Statement-non-opinion

American-, Americans like me#Uninterpretable
and whether I night, uh, uh, not,#Uninterpretable
I think that we're paying too much taxes. Um, that, including taxes in general or income tax,#Statement-opinion
and, um, the other thing was do we get what we pay for,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, what, what is our, what is our opinion on that#Statement-non-opinion
so#Yes-No-Question
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
are you prepared to talk?#Other
.#Non-verbal
Oh, I guess so,#Affirmative non-yes answers
go by ear,#Statement-non-opinion
Let me push.#Offers, Options Commits
Okay,#Agree/Accept
Let me push one here#Offers, Options Commits
Okay, um,#Hold before answer/agreement
well I can just tell you a little bit about taxes in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
It's most interesting because we're one of the few, if,#Statement-opinion
I don't know of any other state, um, does not have a, a state income tax#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so we don't have a state income tax,#Statement-non-opinion
but we certainly make up for it in other ways here.#Statement-opinion
Um, for instance, the local, um, sales tax is eight and a quarter percent.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Isn't that awful#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
How about you?#Open-Question
What do you have there?#Wh-Question
Uh we have a six percent#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sales tax.#Other
And you have state income tax also?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, it's been,#Uninterpretable
people here have just, have this, um,#Uninterpretable
they've been really holding out in the legislature,#Statement-opinion
and it's starting to show, um, in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded,#Statement-opinion
and, and I don't know if Texas is ever going to be able to, to, um, totally avoid having an income tax or not.#Statement-opinion
I think eventually they're going to have to do it#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, um. Do you think you pay too much there,#Yes-No-Question
or how do you feel about that?#Or-Clause
I don't mind my taxes as much as my social security.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Yes answers
interesting,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, the taxes,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
I can deal with that because I know everyone else is paying in too, I guess#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, oh, I don't know, uh,#Hedge
the one thing that,#Uninterpretable
we don't have, uh, tax on clothes#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
do you?#Other
Um, yes#Yes answers
we do have tax on clothes.#Statement-non-opinion
That's what I thought.#Statement-non-opinion
I know New York also has a sales tax on clothes#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I know a lot of kids, like going to college with me, that lived in New York or out of state, and a lot of them would buy their clothes in Pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that,#Statement-non-opinion
How interesting.#Appreciation
I guess I didn't realize that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, we don't have tax on groceries, for instance, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, we don't have it necessarily on food,#Statement-non-opinion
but then there's other things that they nail you for it#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like health and beauty products#Other
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
yes,#Agree/Accept
yes,#Agree/Accept
I should, I should have, um, delineated,#Statement-non-opinion
yet, your absolutely right.#Statement-opinion
It's the food, the consumable food parts that, you know, we don't have to pay#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
tax on.#Other
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
and you really have to watch your, your, um, bill.#Statement-non-opinion
Sometimes I think, um, it's real interesting to look to see how many things that I buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And that's when it really starts to add on,#Statement-opinion
and, um, so, um, that's, that is sort of a help,#Statement-opinion
but, um, I don't know,#Hedge
it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of, of tax on uh, any sale, as far as I'm concerned, um,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that ,#Uninterpretable
It's real interesting, this last, um, tax season,#Statement-opinion
I'm a student,#Statement-non-opinion
and the last tax season I had a, just a part time job helping out in a tax office.#Statement-non-opinion
And the woman that owned the office was saying, she'd had this business for oh, probably seventeen or eighteen years,#Statement-non-opinion
and she was saying as the years have gone on, there are fewer and fewer things that people can, uh, take off of their income tax.#Statement-non-opinion
Deduct, yeah.#Summarize/reformulate
And, you know, if you're not a home owner, or if you haven't sold property, or, uh, have something major like that, it's hardly, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's just not much else you can do,#Other
and she said it's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her, because she used to be real creative about helping them#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
find ways of,#Other
And see,#Uninterpretable
you know, accumulating receipts.#Other
I take it she was an accountant.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Can't do, oh, really#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
can't do it any more.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
I know,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I, I, I also was a student,#Statement-non-opinion
I just graduated in May#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, I graduated with a finance degree,#Statement-non-opinion
but that was the big joke, the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
That was the big joke.#Statement-non-opinion
How interesting. Oh, gosh.#Appreciation
Where did you go to school?#Wh-Question
Clarion University.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you are, you are the same age as my daughter, because she just graduated from college this year too.#Statement-opinion
I'm a graduate student having gone back after many years.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, nevertheless, I am a student, and poor#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, it's, uh, um, you know, it's been,#Uninterpretable
I guess, as far as people like, uh, our family, we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class people with, Americans with#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, college age#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
students, you know,#Other
and, and, I, there just, I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess as you say, you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you are,#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
I think they should go back,#Statement-opinion
I, I realize, you know, that we have, uh, graduated tax brackets,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think they should still go back#Statement-opinion
and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class, I think the burden should be put more on the wealthy.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
Absolutely,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Because it seems like, they still come out okay#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, you know.#Other
you know, they always have the argument, Well, you know, well who's to say we don't work harder to get that#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
well#Statement-opinion
I kind of have my doubts#Statement-opinion
I don't care how much they take off of you, you know#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you're still going to be above, on top,#Statement-opinion
and I,#Uninterpretable
you now#Uninterpretable
That's,#Uninterpretable
like you said, I've worked in different places,#Statement-non-opinion
and the ones that get the most pay do the least work.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Seems that way, yeah, *#Statement-opinion
that the higher they get, the, you know,#Uninterpretable
at least,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
it seems like, um, they must feel like they're paid for all of the years of experience or, um, or something, or just the title, sometimes#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um,#Other
and it, it doesn't seem fair,#Statement-opinion
and I, I know a lot of people do make money, um, you know, in, in good investments and things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think that's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling, and not a, not a whole lot of work#Statement-opinion
I agree with you.#Agree/Accept
I do think it's a lot of luck,#Statement-opinion
and I don't like that part of the finance, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whatsoever.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know,#Hedge
but like what I was saying about the social security, that's real, you know,#Statement-opinion
it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then the more I think about it, the more I think, I'm paying in to something that I,#Statement-non-opinion
granted, you know, I'm paying for my grandparents#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I'm never going to see that.#Statement-opinion
Probably not.#Appreciation
Social Security is going to be gone before I ever get any.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or what's left is not going to be worth anything#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, in terms of how,#Other
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're going to pay me#Collaborative Completion
you can actually use it.#Other
fifty dollars a month, right#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But that's,#Uninterpretable
well, and,#Uninterpretable
I'm sorry,#Statement-opinion
I put in much more than that, you know.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Appreciation
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's,#Uninterpretable
I haven't heard much in recent years, um, about social security,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, for a while there, not too long ago, they were, they were saying that the whole system was going to be bankrupt#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, before very long, because so much was going out for programs that were, it wa-, that originally it was never intended to be used for.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or, you know, programs just weren't in existence#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then, um, I,#Uninterpretable
it sort of calmed down.#Statement-opinion
I haven't heard much lately,#Statement-non-opinion
but if you have talked about that in your classes, you know, in the last few years, I'm sure that you have heard,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Oh, yeah.#Yes answers
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, um, I don't know,#Hedge
I guess we complain about taxes,#Statement-opinion
but, I guess, you know,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you have to be sort of,#Other
you got to look to what they put, you know#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you have to#Statement-opinion
you have decent roads at least#Statement-opinion
appreciate, yeah, what, what you do get for them sometimes#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, I guess it's, it's worse, you know,#Statement-opinion
I'd rather be able to control my money as much as I do with what's left over#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
taxes than to live in, oh, England or, um, some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all#Other
That's true.#Appreciation
and, so, you know, I guess it's all relative,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's how you look at it too.#Statement-opinion
That's exactly right.#Appreciation
I like to,#Uninterpretable
instead of thinking how much, you know, that I'm paying out, I like to just look at it and say oh, well everyone else is doing it too, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right,#Appreciation
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I,#Uninterpretable

Okay,#Other
so now what are your opinions on recycling?#Open-Question
Well, I definitely think that we need to start recycling.#Statement-opinion
I think it has got to be an individual responsibility until,#Statement-opinion
I think if we wait, uh, which is happening until somebody says we have to do it#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it is going to be to late.#Other
I have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have heard that too.#Statement-non-opinion
And that is not too far away,#Statement-opinion
but I don't know how it is there.#Statement-non-opinion
It is very difficult here even if you care like I do to do much.#Statement-opinion
I take, my paper,#Statement-non-opinion
I can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them#Statement-non-opinion
and there are some fire stations I can take newspapers to#Statement-non-opinion
and that is very inconvenient cause I have to wait until I have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile.#Statement-opinion
Well see, I started saving newspapers#Statement-non-opinion
and I would take a ton of them#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, that's, I can't remember where I went to take them,#Statement-non-opinion
but they wouldn't take them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It is real hard to find a spot#Statement-opinion
and then, I don't know if you note, even doing that, the amount of trash we throw away is incredible#Statement-opinion
bottles#Statement-non-opinion
Oh I know.#Agree/Accept
glass#Statement-non-opinion
that cannot be, it could be recycled,#Statement-non-opinion
but there is no place to,#Statement-non-opinion
There is no really recycling facilities.#Collaborative Completion
No.#Agree/Accept
We have a pilot program in Arlington going on I think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as, the trash as they put it out.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that is a good idea.#Statement-opinion
And I think that is what it is going to have to come to. Where we are just forced to.#Statement-opinion
Besides, well like a law or whatever.#Summarize/reformulate
An-, that's how it is#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in New York isn't it.#Other
I think so,#Statement-opinion
just because they have to.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Other
And you get ticketed if you don't do it right.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
And I think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the,#Statement-opinion
it's, It's trouble for me to do what I do#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, I am willing to do it#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Plus you have to have a place to store all of it#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and see I live in an apartment.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It is very difficult.#Statement-opinion
Like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers#Statement-non-opinion
and, so, I don't know.#Hedge
I think there needs to be more places#Statement-opinion
and also I have a real strong opinion.#Statement-non-opinion
In Iowa, the state I am from#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I believe it has gone up to a dollar now.#Other
Every time you buy a container, no matter what it is, whether it is glass, whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever, you pay ten cents for it#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then you take it back to the store#Statement-non-opinion
and you get it back.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, so that way it kind of forces you to recycle.#Summarize/reformulate
You are forced to.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, you also don't see the litter there.#Statement-non-opinion
People just,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
It makes it worthwhile to take it back#Statement-opinion
and I've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if you've tried it#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I have seen them.#Statement-non-opinion
and they have on the ba-, it's five cents, that they pay five cents#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it even shows the states that,#Statement-non-opinion
That take them back.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well, on-, some of them are five, some are ten cents.#Statement-non-opinion
I am looking at it right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Is Texas one of them?#Yes-No-Question
Texas is not one of them see.#Negative non-no answers
So, I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No,#Agree/Accept
I don't think that there is enough being done.#Statement-opinion
Now, I work at J C PENNY at their corporate headquarters.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we have a paper recycling program that, uh, is company wide#Statement-non-opinion
and I do the recycling for that.#Statement-non-opinion
Do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper.#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Good.#Appreciation
Because there is a lot of waste there isn't there.#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
And I know there is a lot of computer paper#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you can't use.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, we use to have, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I don't even remember how much money that they've, uh, I mean, the money that they've made from the recycling program.#Statement-non-opinion
They have donated it to charities.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they have made a substantial amount of money from it.#Other
Something else I think we do can do is support companies that encourage#Statement-opinion
like, I have decided Downy Fabric Softener now has where you can buy a little carton#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you add wa-,#Statement-non-opinion
well, I image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later,#Statement-opinion
but I am going to stick with Downey because they were first.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I want them to have my business.#Statement-non-opinion
And I think packaging could be done much better.#Statement-opinion
There is so much plastic.#Statement-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
Well I know,#Agree/Accept
you see some of the stuff#Statement-non-opinion
and then when they come out with the new things, you are like, well why didn't you think of that before.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
And I think that it's just people have got to be aware.#Statement-opinion
Unfortunately, there are a lot of people that just don't care#Statement-opinion
and they don't want to think about it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, I just look at it, I don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I want to feel like I at least tried.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I don't know.#Hedge
It just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it.#Statement-opinion
Then we will be forced to.#Statement-opinion
It may be too late.#Statement-opinion
Do they not ever, I mean, I don't know that much. Do they not ever burn trash or anything like,#Yes-No-Question
Very little.#Negative non-no answers
That's another thing that,#Uninterpretable
see there were no,#Uninterpretable
Then, that's pollution.#Statement-non-opinion
I know Amway.#Statement-non-opinion
I use a couple of things from Amway that it says this is burnable material.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that doesn't do me any good because I don't have any place to burn it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess you run into the pollution factor.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then just like the glass bottles, that it says on the bottle I can get ten cents, but not in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And there is no place I can take glass to.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh,#Uninterpretable
So, I still throw away a lot of glass.#Statement-non-opinion
It is really sad.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then the packaging thing really grips me.#Statement-non-opinion
You buy some#Statement-non-opinion
and it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay,#Other
Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy?#Wh-Question
Well, as a matter of fact, I was thinking about that the other day,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I really don't know the answer,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, I would sort of like to, uh, think about something in the way of, uh, uh, sort of a sporty car but not any, not, you know, a luxury type sporty one.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um, something that still has a lots of amenities and, you know, gadgets and things.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you do want a lot of that stuff?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
well, yeah#Yes answers
I like, I like some of those things.#Statement-non-opinion
They come in really handy#Statement-non-opinion
What kind of, uh, things are you going to consider,#Wh-Question
you know, what, uh, you said something about the, about the,#Statement-non-opinion
well, what do you call them,#Self-talk
you said amenities,#Statement-non-opinion
Amenities.#Repeat-phrase
that they have,#Other
but what about, um, their reputation of the company or the price.#Wh-Question
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, of course, I guess, uh, price is always the big consideration,#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
It is for me,#Statement-non-opinion
other people,#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
don't seem to have the same problem#Other
Well, that's, that's a big one in my book,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, um, I have preferences for, uh, for some, uh, makers over others, um,#Statement-non-opinion
and I would sort of like to buy American,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, you know, I'm not so totally hung up on that, that I wouldn't buy something else,#Statement-non-opinion
how about you?#Open-Question
Well, um, the last car we bought was American because of, because of that reason,#Statement-non-opinion
but have not been entirely happy with, uh, several things about the car,#Statement-non-opinion
it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as I expected it to be.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Because several things, minor things sort of,#Statement-non-opinion
but still they cost us money, um, that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay, on a car that, that was that new,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
we bought the car new#Statement-non-opinion
and after,#Uninterpretable
um, well, well, well under two years we had to replace the clutch.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, they just said, well, you know, clutches are disposable ,#Statement-non-opinion
and I said, since when?#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Brake pads are disposable ,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
we know that,#Statement-non-opinion
but I never thought a clutch was disposable.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I wouldn't have thought so either.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
so that was, that was kind of a shock#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I guess there's a lot to, to think about when you're trying to make that decision.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you know, the less actually, the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars,#Statement-opinion
they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like, like, uh, uh, a Mercedes Benz,#Statement-non-opinion
they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes,#Statement-opinion
No#Agree/Accept
but then,#Uninterpretable
especially not after two years.#Other
No,#Agree/Accept
but on the other hand, I guess, too, uh, whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Oh I don't know.#Hedge
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've, uh, worked with a couple of people who have owned, uh, various years, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Mercedes#Other
and, even though they do a lot of the work themself then just buying the parts and everything is, is pretty expensive.#Statement-non-opinion
But for them it's, it's sort of a hobby, too,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to own them .#Other
What kind of,#Wh-Question
what brand of car are you thinking about buying#Wh-Question
or like what things are you looking at?#Wh-Question
Well, I haven't re-, really gotten that far with it, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I've always sort of liked General Motors,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a little bit better than some of the others#Other
but, uh, oh, I guess, I really don't know.#Hedge
How come#Uninterpretable
I've been kind of, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess the commercials are getting to me, the Toyota commercials,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I know that a lot of people I've, I've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them, that hardly had any problems at all.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that,#Uninterpretable
I think that's,#Uninterpretable
I think they have a really good, uh, quality.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
My, uh, daughter has owned two different ones,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, you know, we've had some work done on them#Statement-non-opinion
but it's not too bad,#Statement-non-opinion
and the reason,#Uninterpretable
one of the reasons we, um, bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years#Statement-non-opinion
and he lived way out in the country#Statement-non-opinion
so he put a lot of miles on it,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you knew it had, had been through a whole lot,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and yet, you know, it, it held up pretty doggone good,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I thought they would#Other
They seem to be really durable.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I don't know,#Hedge
I'm, I'm not ready to buy a new car yet,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't know, if, if the next time I'm going to try to, to stay with buying something American or if I'm going to go for a little more, what I would consider to be a long-term investment#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well,#Uninterpretable
and I guess, you know, you always have to think about things like, your gas mileage and stuff like that, you know,#Statement-opinion
you ...#Uninterpretable
Oh, it's easy to get gas mileage in this car,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
it gets excellent gas mileage.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's one of the big throwing cards for, some of the foreign ones#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, we talked long enough#Action-directive
I think so.#Agree/Accept
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, enjoyed it.#Conventional-closing
All righty,#Conventional-closing
thanks#Thanking
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay.#Other
Well, um, I used to work in a day care center.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I worked in, um, in all the different areas of the day care center#Statement-non-opinion
and it is, they can be deceiving to people.#Statement-opinion
I did not work there long because I couldn't handle the, the treatment that the children got,#Statement-non-opinion
and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three, um, centers,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
all over, you know, the, um, city#Other
and they would, um, be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, um, I think you need to make, you know, if you do, do day care centers, you know you should make frequent checks and, um, to check in on them when they're not expecting it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because they do, do things differently when you're not around,#Statement-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Well that,#Uninterpretable
I know wh-,#Uninterpretable
the things that we kind of looked at is, is you want to see how many teachers you have.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and how many kids they have and how they break it up.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because we had, we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It, it was a really good one,#Statement-opinion
and in fact, it worked out for us because my wife, we kind of bartered.#Statement-non-opinion
My wife did artwork for them#Statement-non-opinion
and then, you know, so we got our day care free.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But they didn't have enough teachers#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Well, this one was set up good.#Statement-opinion
I mean they had two teachers#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to every room. Um, sometimes three.#Other
And they had a good system like so when you walked in, everything looks cool.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough.#Statement-non-opinion
They did not show them care to these small children who are being left.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, they,#Uninterpretable
one time I picked up this little boy who was crying#Statement-non-opinion
and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
You know,#Other
he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And I said, no,#Statement-non-opinion
this child was crying and needed some comfort, you know,#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what is your problem.#Quotation
So, um,#Uninterpretable
Did, did they separate them by age group?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Because I'd think, you know, I think that's one thing that was important.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
They did, they had like, um, the, the crawlers, the babies that didn't walk in one room.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The ones that were starting to walk in one room.#Other
Then they had like the, um, three, three year olds, upper fours, lower fours, upper fives, lower fives. You know, just like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, they really did separate them well.#Statement-non-opinion
I-, it sound,#Statement-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
It was just the teachers themselves.#Statement-non-opinion
It sounds like to me your, your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
.#Other
But,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Agree/Accept
that they're not,#Statement-non-opinion
Affectionate people that they're, they're kind of par-,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Their system,#Uninterpretable
may be parents themselves or something.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
But their, but their system was, was great#Statement-opinion
but, um, the, you know, the caring just wasn't there.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The one woman that taught that did the babies. I worked with her#Statement-non-opinion
and she was fabulous.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
She loved them babies,#Statement-non-opinion
and she loved them and cared for them.#Statement-non-opinion
But, um, every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and, um, you know, would make me a nervous wreck,#Statement-non-opinion
so, you know.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, I think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D's and all that kind of thing and, you know, know all the technical stuff,#Statement-opinion
but if they don't reach out and touch the kids, then that doesn't do any good.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
these kids are just in a day care center all day#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, with no, any type of emotional, you know, getting love, getting care,#Other
they're just there.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know. Going through this routine,#Other
An-,#Uninterpretable
which is lousy.#Other
The other, the other group that we had was kind of interesting.#Statement-non-opinion
The other one we went to the, it was a husband and wife team#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we knew them from other associations#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one,#Statement-opinion
and I think, you know, she would, she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
but he was actually the more, um, the more, uh, what, demonstrative type.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The more loving#Other
he would, you know, laugh with the kids and play with the kids#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and i-, it was kind of interesting to see that, that it was actually the man in the group that, that did that side of it.#Other
An-,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you don't see that much.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so they had a really nice balance.#Statement-non-opinion
We liked that one.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something,#Statement-non-opinion
That's cute.#Appreciation
but they also did, they also did some of the teaching things#Statement-non-opinion
and then they had, um, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
obedience, obedience was important.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that has to be with a day care center.#Statement-opinion
And you know so they, you know, they used, uh, oh, I think they used the,#Statement-non-opinion
you probably heard where, you know, where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
I've never heard of that.#Negative non-no answers
That's, that's a new one,#Statement-non-opinion
And it's, it's one,#Uninterpretable
on me.#Other
Uh, I can't remember what they call it actually#Statement-non-opinion
but y-, you just stand them in front of a clock#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, it has a second-hand that goes around.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they have to stand there,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay,#Other
so what kind of movies have you seen, lately, I guess?#Wh-Question
Um, a lot,#Uninterpretable
well, the last movie I saw, but it wasn't my choice, was the NINJA TURTLE movie#Statement-non-opinion
Obviously you have kids.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
That's right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but my preference is the one we saw before that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't seen that one yet.#Statement-non-opinion
That's an excellent movie.#Statement-opinion
Um, the last movie I saw was, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, was that good.#Statement-opinion
I heard,#Uninterpretable
Uh, see, I'm not a big Julie Roberts fan.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I was a lot, I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would be.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was a pretty good movie.#Statement-opinion
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I'm ready to go.#Statement-non-opinion
It just,#Uninterpretable
it's, you know, hasn't worked out that way yet.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, it's, uh, it looks good, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Statement-opinion
if you like thrillers, anyway.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
And I do.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, people I've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards.#Statement-non-opinion
So#Uninterpretable
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, I love them like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm not,#Uninterpretable
I mean, I, I like all ranges of movies,#Statement-non-opinion
but I like that where they run tense.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I really enjoy,#Statement-non-opinion
they keep me guessing the whole time.#Statement-non-opinion
It's really, it was really interesting.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, what other movies have you seen then lately?#Wh-Question
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Other than the,#Statement-non-opinion
I assume you were talking about the new NINJA TURTLES.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the new one, of course#Statement-non-opinion
Is that any good,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
I mean, I'm sure I'm going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives, and she's got two boys that I took to see the first one.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I'm sure I'm going to see the next one here real soon.#Statement-non-opinion
Amarillo.#Repeat-phrase
I didn't see the first one.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband said it was, um, about the same lines.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, then it won't be too bad.#Appreciation
So, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, it wasn't impressive necessarily,#Statement-opinion
but it was better than it could have been.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I was impressed with the fact that, um, it wasn't that childish.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know what I mean.#Rhetorical-Questions
It wasn't,#Uninterpretable
my daughter's five,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean she understood everything.#Statement-non-opinion
She goes to almost all movies with us except, you know, R rated.#Statement-non-opinion
And she really enjoyed it,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was on a higher level, you know, where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did,#Statement-non-opinion
and I liked that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's important if you're going, you know, if you're going, uh, kids are going to, uh, parents are going to have to go#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you ought to make it at least semi-,#Other
.#Non-verbal
you know, semi for them too.#Other
That's right,#Appreciation
that's right.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's pretty good.#Statement-opinion
But we take her to just about every movie,#Statement-non-opinion
and, she, uh, she does really good.#Statement-non-opinion
We've taken her from real young,#Statement-non-opinion
and she does real good.#Statement-non-opinion
Like I said, we don't take her to R -s.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, if and when we ever get a baby-sitter, like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, we go see it.#Statement-non-opinion
I's about to say, you're not going to take her to that one, I'm sure.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no,#Agree/Accept
no.#Agree/Accept
Do you take her, or do you go to a lot of comedy movies#Yes-No-Question
or to,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah.#Yes answers
What was the last comedy you saw?#Wh-Question
Oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw?#Self-talk
Huh, huh, huh. Good question,#Hold before answer/agreement
good question.#Hold before answer/agreement
We don't get to go that often,#Statement-non-opinion
but something on the tip of my tongue,#Hold before answer/agreement
and I can't think of which one it was.#Hold before answer/agreement
Uh. Gosh, I can't remember.#Statement-non-opinion
The last, uh,#Uninterpretable
in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I said that wrong,#Statement-non-opinion
the last movie I saw was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox.#Statement-non-opinion
But that, that sounds good.#Appreciation
Well, that really wasn't too bad.#Statement-opinion
There were,#Uninterpretable
you know, he's supposed,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, he's this actor, right#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he's playing a cop.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
I think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, there, there were times when he was, like, he'd be running with a gun or whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
He didn't look like a cop when he did it.#Statement-non-opinion
And I was so#Statement-non-opinion
That's neat.#Appreciation
impressed with that because, you know, usually,#Other
The part was hard, to do that.#Collaborative Completion
Oh yeah,#Agree/Accept
because, I mean, everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to, you know, to imitate them or whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I thought he did such an excellent job of not#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
going that far.#Other
Now, by the end he was looking more like a cop.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part, you know, he was trying to, trying to get it,#Other
but he wasn't there yet.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you could tell it,#Statement-non-opinion
and I guess that I thought was a real good acting and writing job both, you know, because I think, or directing job.#Statement-opinion
I think they did a real good job of that.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And James Woods, I think is who it was, did an excellent job as the cop.#Statement-opinion
I mean, you know, he just,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like him.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and there were, there were some definite, um, should I say, tense moments,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
with him in there.#Other
Probably the last comedy we saw, now that I think about it, is HOME ALONE.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, I had seen it before Christmas,#Statement-non-opinion
but I took a date to it, uh, about a month ago.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I, I, I've seen it the second time not too long ago.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
It was really cute.#Statement-opinion
I really enjoyed it.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Of course, the bad thing about it was, uh, the second time I saw it, I didn't really enjoy it as much,#Statement-non-opinion
and I was kind of surprised at that.#Statement-non-opinion
I thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But before,#Uninterpretable
maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time. I had laughed so hard I was hoarse.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I really was, I was hoarse getting out of there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And maybe I just laughed so hard the first time that I didn't have it,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it just wasn't as funny the second time#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I had just gone overboard the first time.#Other
I don't know#Hedge
but,#Uninterpretable
Maybe so,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
maybe so.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, it was, it was a great movie though.#Statement-opinion
I loved the movie.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I did, too.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm looking forward to this summer, uh, NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF is coming out.#Statement-non-opinion
I love those movies.#Statement-non-opinion
I do too.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, they are just slapstick#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
It,#Uninterpretable
you have to see those twice to catch everything.#Statement-opinion
Well, you have to see them more than that.#Reject
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, I still catch things in AIRPLANE that I didn't catch.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, it's amazing#Uninterpretable
I do too.#Statement-non-opinion
I love those movies#Statement-non-opinion
I do too.#Statement-non-opinion
I really do.#Statement-non-opinion
So I'm looking forward to seeing that#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because that looks hilarious,#Other
.#Non-verbal
as they all do.#Other
Oh yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, we we try to go a couple times a month, I guess#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to see a movie.#Other
It, it's just getting so expensive.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, isn't it though.#Appreciation
You know, but that's at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper.#Statement-non-opinion
But normally we don't think about it until,#Statement-non-opinion
That's exactly what,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I was going to say.#Other
I keep not doing it until after I'm there#Statement-non-opinion
and then all of a sudden I'm saying I wish I'd bought these things.#Statement-non-opinion
I know, because we can go spend fifteen dollars#Statement-non-opinion
Easily.#Appreciation
just getting in#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the three of us.#Other
And then if you want popcorn and stuff#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's just, I mean, uh, it's incredible.#Other
I don't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both.#Statement-non-opinion
You know popcorn is not that expensive.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Other
No,#Agree/Accept
nowhere near that expensive.#Appreciation
So they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke.#Statement-non-opinion
And, it, it's just the idea that these, uh, these actors, you know, live in such lavish style.#Statement-opinion
I mean, it's as simple as that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We just keep breeding them.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and as long as we keep paying the money for it, they are going to keep paying them.#Statement-opinion
I guess so.#Appreciation
Now have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Oh yeah.#Yes answers
Oh, that was, that was an excellent movie.#Statement-opinion
I haven't seen,#Statement-non-opinion
we're waiting for the video.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Reject
don't.#Action-directive
No,#Repeat-phrase
really?#Backchannel in question form
Don't.#Action-directive
That needs the big screen.#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It really and truly does, because to get the feeling#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of like when the buffalos are, when they're chasing the buffalos and everything#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you've got to be where you feel it.#Other
Oh really?#Backchannel in question form
You really truly do.#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I would,#Uninterpretable
I mean, I guess my first instinct was to wait for the video, too.#Statement-non-opinion
But I'm glad I didn't.#Statement-non-opinion
I really and truly am.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, that mov-, that was one movie I came out impressed.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I really and truly did.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I have absolutely no problems with them winning seven Oscars.#Statement-non-opinion
None at all.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Normally I'm one of these people that I don't like one, one movie taking all the honors.#Statement-non-opinion
Everythin-,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I wanted him to win best actor on top of it,#Statement-non-opinion
he was,#Uninterpretable
Yeah, oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like I said, I wouldn't given the supporting actresses either one.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But even though they were okay, the girl in it,#Statement-non-opinion
they,#Uninterpretable
somebody made an interesting observation,#Statement-non-opinion
now that I think back on it, I'd say yeah, I can't believe that either.#Statement-non-opinion
She was the only indian to have her hair done at all times.#Statement-non-opinion
You know what I mean, you know.#Other
.#Non-verbal
It was just too perfect at all times.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That was a mistake that they made.#Statement-opinion
They shouldn't have done it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now the best,#Uninterpretable
the supporting actor, he was good,#Statement-non-opinion
but from what I heard, the guy who got it was better,#Statement-non-opinion
so I, you know, I can see that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, oh,#Uninterpretable
You think my daughter would like it?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, well there are, there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side.#Negative non-no answers
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
But, um, it's it's#Uninterpretable
She doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
no problems#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
It, it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide, the hides.#Statement-non-opinion
So there's,#Uninterpretable
See, that's the one, that is the honest to God the one reason I don't want to see the movie#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, well,#Uninterpretable
is because I love buffalos for some weird reason,#Other
and I know they're fake.#Statement-non-opinion
And, and, of course,#Other
and, well, yeah,#Uninterpretable
that, and plus, I mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I mean, they are killing buffalos in it.#Statement-non-opinion
But they don't stress that very much,#Statement-non-opinion
they really don't.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think it's an excellent movie for,#Statement-opinion
if, if she enjoys movies I think it'll work pretty good.#Statement-opinion
Oh, that'll be good.#Appreciation
We really need some,#Statement-non-opinion
my husband keeps wanting to.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, it's, it's a long movie.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I heard the video's even going to be longer.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They did a lot of stuff that they cut out.#Statement-non-opinion
I may have to see the video.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's true,#Appreciation
they said,#Uninterpretable
I hadn't even thought of that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they said there's a lot that had been edited, because of the length#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that they wanted in,#Other
so they're going to put it in the video.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that way you can watch it at your leisure.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I kind of like it when they do that, because the video, like I said,#Statement-non-opinion
there are certain things you can't do with a video#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the idea that they may put a little extra in it I think is a good idea.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I mean when you rent a video,#Statement-non-opinion
videos, of course, are not cheap either#Statement-non-opinion
True.#Appreciation
and so the idea of getting a little extra with it I think is a good idea. Because they, they make bundles of money off those things.#Statement-non-opinion
I know it#Appreciation
Isn't that ridiculous.#Rhetorical-Questions
We have cable which#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I do too.#Statement-non-opinion
helps a lot#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but not enough.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we keep holding out, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm getting to the point where, you know, I watch, well I watch NICK AT NIGHT.#Statement-non-opinion

Okay Karen.#Other
You-, you're first.#Action-directive
Okay.#Offers, Options Commits
I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement. You know, not to get in, like in a dead end job.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And plus, for me, it's, uh, I mean like medical and you know, uh, benefits and dental.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They're also important.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess one of the differences I see is, uh, working for a university, uh, there is room for advancement, but not so much so, our in, uh, quite a highly unionized environment#Statement-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
and then also in the administrative association#Other
so there is a progressive path,#Statement-non-opinion
but not being in the say the commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people#Statement-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
uh, like really,#Other
Are they like pretty much train for a specific job#Yes-No-Question
and that what I hired for and then I, just very little variation from that.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
somewhat that,#Statement-opinion
but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have, uh, a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution, perhaps somewhat even with the business, uh.#Statement-opinion
But I agree, you know, the, uh, medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the, uh, security aspect for long term employment, uh,#Statement-opinion
Well, you know that's interesting though.#Statement-opinion
Because I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore.#Statement-opinion
I use to think that, you know, after you work,#Statement-non-opinion
you mean security, job security?#Yes-No-Question
Job security,#Statement-non-opinion
yes.#Yes answers
Uh, that use to be I think a couple of years ago,#Statement-opinion
but I don't know if it is so much anymore.#Hedge
In fact, they, we just had a lay off in what November, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, it wasn't necessarily,#Uninterpretable
I mean, you know, some people had been there a long time.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we are seeing that here as well.#Statement-non-opinion
Like in some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, so I, I think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in, uh, institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses, we need to cut back, that's what we do.#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
No doubt#Agree/Accept
But,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
and institutionally, like here at the university, oh if there is a cut back, well gee, it's not where it necessarily where it's needed,#Statement-opinion
it's where it's most expedient which,#Statement-opinion
Expedient,#Repeat-phrase
yeah#Agree/Accept
that's exactly it.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
where the most dollar, where, where you know it cuts back the most.#Summarize/reformulate
Well, in one sense for us, it's where it makes the least noise which means it's#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
often the lowest support type roles.#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
See, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So we,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's one of the things too.#Statement-opinion
You get too many management people, you know.#Statement-opinion
It's very easy.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's very easy for them to say, oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, those people aren't there anymore.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Because it's support people that are providing#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the speed for it.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but,#Uninterpretable
so what else do you think is important?#Open-Question
Well the, uh,#Uninterpretable
that's maybe the majority of the importance, I guess.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
because my perspective is from an institution,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, the, there is not much incentive for innovativeness#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because the limitation for reward is very severe#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but if you're in the corporate world, I think there is considerable motivation for I guess in-, innovation,#Statement-opinion
although he, you know, the more complex your structure the, uh, less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, I think there is, uh, it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's, uh, things can happen much more quickly#Statement-opinion
and so you can see the reward of the efforts.#Statement-opinion
I think probably in a small,#Statement-opinion
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I was going to say more, it's more personal for one thing.#Statement-opinion
You probably have a better team, uh, cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Probably, where as in a bigger corporation, I think you're just a number, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You end up being your own person#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up, well then that's their problem#Statement-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know you really,#Other
whereas yeah in a smaller,#Statement-opinion
I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Okay Uh, let me see.#Other
Unfortunately, we are not much into recycling.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We don't, we don't do enough.#Statement-non-opinion
I know we don't so#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, although lately I've been, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
a friend of mine that I spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, it's, it's, uh, interesting to watch some of the things that she does#Statement-non-opinion
and then she's almost had an impact on me, uh, where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but I can kind of tell it bothers her so,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
just unconsciously I've, I've stopped buying a lot of, uh, uh, paper plates and paper cups#Other
and I don't do that anymore.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know why,#Statement-non-opinion
I just don't I just, just from socializing with her#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
How do you, how, uh, is recycling done in your community?#Wh-Question
Is,#Uninterpretable
It really, it, there's not a whole lot,#Statement-non-opinion
there really isn't.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio, each, each house has,#Statement-non-opinion
they're, they're given three baskets#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they put them out on a certain day of the week#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and each, uh, home does participate#Statement-non-opinion
but we really don't have anything, uh, close in this area that, that do anything.#Statement-non-opinion
And, and some of the communities that do, the residents are having to pay to participate in it.#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which really doesn't make sense.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Over here, they, uh, have several private companies that you can take, uh, recycled,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
materials to.#Other
But, uh, if you want to take them all to one place, they have, uh, the first Saturday of every month, they have certain places that you can drop them off.#Statement-non-opinion
That's what I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and I, I recycle aluminum, glass, uh, newspapers.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's good.#Appreciation
So it's nice to have, you know, one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place#Statement-opinion
and, *#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's another thing.#Statement-non-opinion
You have to#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Other
go to different places to do that.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's, so that's nice.#Statement-opinion
It would be, it would be really nice if they, uh, came to the house to pick it up#Statement-opinion
and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, uh, it didn't go through.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. Which, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
it just doesn't make sense to me.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess what they, what they were talking about here was, uh, was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or something, you know.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, so I guess that's one option.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's good,#Appreciation
that's good.#Appreciation
I guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too.#Statement-non-opinion
Like, uh#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this little number now that tells what#Yes-No-Question
Huh.#Uninterpretable
kind of plastic it is?#Other
No.#No answers
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle,#Statement-non-opinion
you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I didn't know that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So now they're like marking, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
they're,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
there's six, seven, eight different kind of plastics#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they mark on the bottom what kind it is.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I guess that makes it easy to recycle#Statement-non-opinion
and then they're,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
they're, uh, trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them, you know, that are, that are only made out of one kind of plastic#Other
so that#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that makes it easier I guess.#Other
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
I, I'm, you know,#Uninterpretable
unfortunately Garland doesn't have, doesn't,#Statement-non-opinion
they don't, I don't know, they don't do anything like that#Statement-non-opinion
or I, you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility bills#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or your, uh, garbage collection#Other
and they haven't, you know, talked about doing something like that#Statement-non-opinion
Where does your friend go to to recycle?#Wh-Question
She lives in Garland#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm not sure where, what she does.#Statement-non-opinion
But she's, uh, oh she's ve-, very heavy in that#Statement-non-opinion
and she takes her own bags to the grocery store#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products in her house.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that, to start doing.#Statement-non-opinion
And she does make a lot of sense.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just her whole house is like wow.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess that's how it gets passed on. You know, when one person, you hear#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
from another person#Other
and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It seems to be catching on, uh, slowly but surely, I guess#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat.#Statement-non-opinion
I sat and watched him.#Statement-non-opinion
You know the Barney?#Yes-No-Question
You know the little, I don't know if you know the little character Barney.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
They had one, uh, on that kind of, type of thing#Statement-non-opinion
and how children can, can do that#Statement-non-opinion
and how to save water b-, when you brush your teeth in water#Statement-non-opinion
and it's really caught on#Statement-non-opinion
and he's only four#Statement-non-opinion
and he's really caught on.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Wow,#Appreciation
that's cute.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
That's neat,#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
When you,#Uninterpretable
And keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
He's really caught on#Statement-non-opinion
so that's really neat#Statement-opinion
Well, when you start early, I guess,#Statement-opinion

Okay,#Other
have you ever served as a juror?#Yes-No-Question
Never.#Negative non-no answers
I've never been served on the jury, never been called up in a jury, although some of my friends have been jurors.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I never have either.#Statement-non-opinion
You haven't, huh.#Uninterpretable
If you were, uh, what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers?#Open-Question
Well, I think it's a good idea.#Statement-opinion
I think our justice system needs a major overhaul,#Statement-opinion
and I'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it.#Statement-non-opinion
But I think they've got a lot of problems.#Statement-opinion
I think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury, and to get to trial.#Statement-opinion
True.#Agree/Accept
And I don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or, or what,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh. Sometimes I think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined,#Statement-opinion
and they're too easily swayed by their emotion.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think that's true.#Agree/Accept
Hence is possible error as you can see in all the IRONSIDES,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
T V shows.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do, would you prefer all trials by a judge?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I think there are certain things that, uh, the jury can determine as far as, uh, guilty or not guilty,#Statement-opinion
but as far as the af-, af-, affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature, I don't know if that is best left up to the jury to de-, to award, you know.#Statement-opinion
Two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing, you know, it's true that, you know, this may be sad and all that thing,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, the jury I think is best, in most cases, suited for determination of guilt and innocence, but not the award of, of penalties and fines and punishment.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I would agree with that.#Agree/Accept
I think you're righ-,#Statement-opinion
I think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company,#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
But, uh, I do like the idea of the jury being the, the people who decide in the matter of, uh, if it's a jail term versus life and death#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, the death penalty and such.#Other
If they give them all the information.#Statement-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
when it comes to sentencing phase, I guess they tell them if a guy, if the person has a previous record and stuff.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sometimes it seems like during the trial part, the jury's not, you know, misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave,#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the judge decides whether or not they should hear it.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, it, it, it's kind of difficult,#Statement-opinion
and I guess the whole system is set up to rather let, uh, some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in, in jail#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
although you still hear about those occasionally.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury?#Yes-No-Question
Um, I don't know.#Other answers
I, you know, I heard a very interesting,#Statement-non-opinion
and maybe it's just the T V show or movie I was watching,#Hedge
they were going through a trial,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it was like on one of the, the documentary T V shows where they ask for the, the verdict by the jury#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they went by each one, saying guilty or innocent, guilty or innocent.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they took it more as just like a majority.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I, I,#Uninterpretable
Some of them disagree,#Summarize/reformulate
I mean, some of them said one way and some the other.#Summarize/reformulate
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
but they took, you know, whatever the majority was.#Statement-non-opinion
So I didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is.#Statement-non-opinion
I always thought it had to be unanimous.#Statement-opinion
I think it does have to be unanimous.#Statement-opinion
But, uh. Rather interesting.#Statement-opinion
I know they can poll a jury, make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was,#Statement-non-opinion
but I thought that they all had to agree#Statement-opinion
or else they, it was a hung jury.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
I did, I did also.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I thi-, I don't know how I feel about that.#Statement-non-opinion
I think maybe, uh, majority might be sufficient.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's hard to say though.#Hedge
What about in international trials.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Do you think they should have a jury there?#Yes-No-Question
Oh.#Hold before answer/agreement
I think that would be kind of interesting.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I hadn't thought about international trials at all.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess the, the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like, you know, the old day with the rack.#Other
We, they're going to say, Okay, you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, whose going to really make them.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Nobody.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So. But I think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of, you know, people from different countries, uh, in as international law also.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for something like that because of the cultural differences.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Things like that.#Other
I don't know how, what it would take to be, come up with a true perfect system, or if one exists.#Statement-non-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What about uniform sentencing?#Other
Uh, is that the crime#Yes-No-Question
and it's already, some chart and determine the punishment,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
or.#Uninterpretable
Right.#Other
Yeah,#Yes answers
like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years.#Statement-non-opinion
It's not a discretionary thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think there should be a core minimum that they get#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, I guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique, that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum, things of that nature.#Statement-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I wish that when they sentence someone, if they're going to sentence him to five years, then make him serve five years.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that serves a kind of if they're, I guess, uh,#Statement-opinion
if you sentence someone to life, life is only forty-nine years, something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
And I guess you're eligible after twenty-seven for parole, even though you're in for life.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and sometimes those people are, are young enough, they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
although I guess it's, you, you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't believe that very often happens.#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
Because uh, inside the jail there, I don't think there's no real rehabilitation.#Statement-opinion
I don't think so either.#Agree/Accept
In fact, I think they end up worse, because the conditions are so bad.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's another war zone.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
But, who knows.#Rhetorical-Questions
I think, I think maybe they ought to just be punished with some, some kind of real punishment, like hard labor for a shorter length of time, you know.#Statement-opinion
I agree,#Agree/Accept
get them out there,#Statement-opinion
Actually make them do something that's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the, you know, world and not spend so much time sitting around, letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them,#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Sure,#Agree/Accept
they should have them go out and doing stuff.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Cleaning up, or picking up dirt, or weeds, or who knows what. Something for the, for the state,#Other
since the state is paying for them, they should get some kind of, kind of work out of them.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Something besides license plates and tiddlywinks.#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Trading their lives for cigarettes#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
those kinds of things.#Other

and I've been very lucky.#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't needed child care except for my mom.#Statement-non-opinion
So#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've been real lucky.#Other
I'm a nurse,#Statement-non-opinion
I go to school, I mean, I go to work early,#Statement-non-opinion
so my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for her school or just hangs by while she gets ready#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's nice.#Appreciation
drives her to school,#Statement-non-opinion
then I'm home to pick her up.#Statement-non-opinion
So I'm very, very lucky#Statement-non-opinion
That is lucky.#Appreciation
Well, how old, um, does a child have to be before you have to, you get to stop making arrangements for him, I wonder.#Declarative Wh-Question
Well, I could do it now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But she gets lonely#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the morning,#Other
and I feel better.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, she has a crazy father out there somewhere that I just don't let her out of my sight.#Statement-non-opinion
So, um#Statement-non-opinion
Well, and, um, it's nice for them#Statement-opinion
you never know.#Other
not to be alone.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
she feels that way, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and go to school with,#Other
but we just feel better doing it this way.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Statement-non-opinion
Not after wor-,#Appreciation
I don't know what day we'll stop.#Other
We, we were about to stop one day this year,#Statement-non-opinion
and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats,#Statement-non-opinion
and so#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
we didn't stop.#Other
And so, so, um, you know, you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen.#Statement-opinion
So#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even though she's twelve, she's still a kid,#Other
so#Statement-opinion
She is.#Appreciation
you got to be careful#Other
Well, I'm glad you have that, um, opportunity to have your mom.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I'm, I'm glad too#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I, I have two kids#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, five and six, a girl and a boy,#Other
and, um, so far I haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because, um, I'm at home now#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
full time.#Other
But, um, when I was going to school, I would go to school a time that my husband wasn't, you know, when he was at home#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that we would just switch back and forth like that.#Statement-non-opinion
But, um, it's really scary,#Statement-opinion
and I would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I would, too, because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside, we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I, I just don't know what I would do if#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
I had to do that.#Other
I know the hospital that I work in is a big hospital#Statement-non-opinion
and they provide child care,#Statement-non-opinion
and of course they charge for it#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but at least all the nurses can leave their children,#Statement-non-opinion
and they're always watching them,#Statement-non-opinion
they can eat lunch with them,#Statement-non-opinion
if they feel sick they can call them at work and they run over and check on them,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way.#Other
So. *#Uninterpretable
Well, that's nice.#Appreciation
Yeah, *#Other
it is nice. *#Statement-non-opinion
And I know that I have, um, done some babysitting myself,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
when I was in school and needed extra money.#Statement-non-opinion
And I know how I feel, how I felt as a provider of child care that, even though you're, you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to, you know, treat them equally and, you know, better, usually, better than your own#Statement-opinion
Right, right *#Other
um, it's not the same,#Statement-opinion
and it made me realize that, um, no one will love your child as much as#Statement-opinion
Well that's right. *#Other
you and your mother, your#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
and, um, the family#Other
and no one will look out, after them,#Statement-opinion
and I just think, um, so far I think my preference would be rather than to have like a, oh, a big day care#Statement-non-opinion
that, um, what is that like, child, Kinder Care and#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
things like that,#Other
rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something,#Statement-non-opinion
I would prefer to have in home care, either my own home or a#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
neighbor or something.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Just never know.#Agree/Accept
I babysat for the little girl next door for a year or so when her parents first got divorced,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was hard to treat her equally with my child.#Other
They were the same age,#Statement-non-opinion
and they played together,#Statement-non-opinion
and they were good friends,#Statement-non-opinion
but like you said, you tend to go more for the other one's side#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
just because you are responsible#Other
and so#Statement-non-opinion
It is hard.#Summarize/reformulate
it, it got hard,#Other
my daughter got jealous#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, it just wasn't the same as when they were just playing as friends, because she had to be there every day.#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I stopped that after a year, because it was difficult#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to balance it,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
And I know, um, when I pick my kids up from school they want to come home.#Statement-non-opinion
And I#Statement-non-opinion
They do.#Appreciation
and I would hate for them to have, be picked up#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
by a day care#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and be taken to another#Other
I know, I know. *#Agree/Accept
large group situation.#Other
So I think, uh, my preference would be a small, small, if I had to find day care#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah. *#Other
would be a small, someone that I knew#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I would rather do without some things *#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I know that some parents, they both do have to work, *#Other
but a lot of people where I live are working just because they want bigger and better,#Statement-non-opinion
and I would never do that.#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
I never have done it,#Statement-non-opinion
and I just never would do it.#Statement-non-opinion
I would rather do without some things that really aren't very important compared to being with my child when they're growing up.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Well, that's true, because even now, when they're gone to school, it seems like there's just not enough time left over *#Statement-opinion
No#Agree/Accept
in the day.#Other
there isn't,#Other
there isn't any time,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time,#Statement-opinion
and, there's just not enough to, time in the day to do anything good quality for them,#Statement-opinion
but that's really,#Uninterpretable

Okay.#Other
Uh, let me see#Hold before answer/agreement
I've been sitting here awhile.#Statement-non-opinion
I almost forgot the topic.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, it seems like I get most of my news from television.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, we only get the paper on the weekends#Statement-non-opinion
and so I'm not much of a, of a paper reader#Statement-non-opinion
or but I, I and I'm don't, rarely listen to the, uh, radio#Statement-non-opinion
so I get most of my news like from documentaries like FORTY-EIGHT HOURS, TWENTY TWENTY, you know, the news at night.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
News in the afternoon, that kind of thing.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I get a,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
weekend paper as well#Other
and, uh, in addition to that I get a local weekly.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I live in suburb of Milwaukee#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they get, they have community newspapers around here so the local, their extremely local stuff#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, is in the local paper that comes out once a week#Other
and then I get the Sunday, uh, MILWAUKEE JOURNAL because I don't have time to read a paper.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, mostly#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's my difficulty.#Other
I, uh, I get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do, although I do listen to N P R which has very good, and that's National Public Radio which#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
has very good, uh, coverage of the national and international news, I feel#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and does a pretty good job of analysis as well.#Other
Are you in the car quite a bit#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
No,#No answers
I'm not actually. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
but I can run my radio in my office.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
teach at the university#Other
and when I'm not#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
teaching, if I choose to have the radio on I can listen to that station,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, I see. Uh,#Response Acknowledgement
How are you, are you satisfied with the TWENTY TWENTY and FORTY-EIGHT HOURS and the things that you do watch?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
I, I, I pretty much am#Statement-non-opinion
and I watch the news at least twice a day.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, if I've missed something and, and I've just recently decided to stay home with my children#Statement-non-opinion
and so it seems as if I catch the news ris-, right as it happens, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There was the explosions and that kind of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband will say how did you know about that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Quotation
it happened at such and such time#Quotation
And that's so, that, that's different for me.#Statement-non-opinion
So I usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is, is the timely yo-, noting of the events as they happen?#Yes-No-Question
Is that what you feel good about in the news coverage?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, no#No answers
it just seems like since I've recently stayed home, that is what's happened, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
It's just that, uh, now that I've stayed home, I'm, I'm usually aware of when these things occurred#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it happened#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Well, I, myself, uh, th-, the reason why I listen to N P R and the reason why I watch MACNEIL LEHRER,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
rather than the, than the network news shows at night, although I do o-, watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories#Other
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, is that quite often it seems to me the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis.#Other
.#Non-verbal
The local doesn't either#Statement-non-opinion
but I feel that MACNEIL LEHRER get a little more deeply into some, some of the issues that are really current.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
*#Non-verbal
And perhaps newspapers do that#Statement-opinion
but as I said, I don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper#Statement-non-opinion
and frankly when I have read a newspaper#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I haven't noticed that kind of analysis either.#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So. Uh, there's, there is some danger to that, of course, too.#Statement-opinion
Because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then, you know, how good is it.#Rhetorical-Questions
But, uh, I like a little more indepth coverage#Statement-non-opinion
and I think that's what you're, maybe appealing to you too on something like TWENTY TWENTY or#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
FORTY-EIGHT HOURS.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
It kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That kind of thing.#Hedge
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So. Uh,#Uninterpretable
I'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
rather than simply being aware that, you know, there, that an event has occurred#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture.#Statement-non-opinion
Maybe because I'm easily confused by detail.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know#Hedge
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know what you're saying.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
So.#Uninterpretable
But I try and catch most of those programs on Wednesday's and Friday's#Statement-non-opinion
and if I miss them, I try you know, I try and, and tape them if I'm out that kind of thing,#Statement-non-opinion
I try and tape them#Statement-non-opinion
and so I can sit back and watch them.#Statement-non-opinion
And it's pretty interesting.#Statement-non-opinion
When,#Uninterpretable
you have young children, right?#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
So those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the T V set for awhile without interruption.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, yeah.#Yes answers
Plus, I find that I have to video tape quite a bit of things#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you do?#Backchannel in question form
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If I don't want any interruptions, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That kind of thing.#Hedge
When is your good watching time?#Wh-Question
Uh, it seems like ten o'clock at night#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's what,#Uninterpretable
Unfortunately,#Statement-non-opinion
but that, that's what it seems like, ten o'clock at night.#Statement-non-opinion
I have older children#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and getting dinner on the table.#Other
I come from the east coast#Statement-non-opinion
and I was,#Uninterpretable
it amazed me when I got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time, they still watch the news when,#Statement-non-opinion

Yes,#Other
I saw HOME ALONE with some friends just a couple days ago.#Statement-non-opinion
I wanted to see it, uh, because there was, uh, much recommended,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
for months and months and months#Other
and it was a, a genre that I wasn't in the least bit interested in,#Statement-non-opinion
and I usually, when I hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even if it's in a genre I don't like,#Other
I figure, well, I should go see it, because if this is, you know, the best of the genre and I should know about it, or something like that#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I usually come away thinking, no I really don't like this show#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, I, I feel that way when movies are like blown up, out of proportion, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
usually people tell you how good they are,#Statement-non-opinion
and you always, you know, end up with expectations too high or whatever,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, the, the problem I had with the movie was the problem I've had with a lot of, uh, I guess, Hollywood movies#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which is they are, it's a formula movie,#Other
and they're making the movie according to certain formula that's a good formula#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they seem to fall short of, of being really creative with a lot of things,#Statement-opinion
I mean#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
here's the situation of this kid at home, you know,#Other
it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
and, you know, he did some clever things,#Statement-opinion
but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was, it seems to me they could have done a lot more, I mean, you know, basically stepping on things and yelling in pain#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie, because that's, uh, not really the way comedies are right now#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, all the comedies are more like jokes and, you know, gags and stuff like that#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's not as much slapstick anymore.#Statement-opinion
Well, I guess it was a, uh, a very successful movie financially,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we may see more slapstick.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
tha-, well, that's true,#Statement-opinion
it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is, it is,#Statement-opinion
and I guess you don't have to, but, you know, if you look at oh,#Statement-non-opinion
have you ever seen any of the movies?#Yes-No-Question
Excuse me?#Signal-non-understanding
The French movies that .#Statement-non-opinion
No,#No answers
not really,#Negative non-no answers
the last movie I saw I guess, uh, was, uh, uh, the one about the French, the Frenchman that leaves and comes back, and he's someone different.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, he's, uh,#Uninterpretable
well, it's about a man, uh, that, uh, leaves his home and comes back to his wife,#Statement-non-opinion
and his wife's all excited#Statement-non-opinion
but the guy that comes back is not her original husband,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um.#Statement-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
O'Gear um, I'm sure you've heard of it,#Other
it was a very famous, uh, popular movie.#Statement-opinion
Norman Gray,#Statement-non-opinion
Norman Gear.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Reject
I'm not with you so far,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, shoot, I'm going to hit myself after I hang up.#Statement-non-opinion
I'll remember the name.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But, uh, anyway, that was a French movie#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was, um, that was the last one I saw downtown,#Statement-non-opinion
but I live in D C#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, actually Falls Church, Virginia, outside the city#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, so a lot of times they have the, the, the, international films downtown#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, so this, uh, French I guess are into the slapsti-,#Statement-opinion
I guess they would like Jerry Lewis, too.#Statement-opinion
They have, they have a#Uninterpretable
Yes they like your Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated Am-, of sophisticated American everywhere.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But they have this one guy who does slapstick comedy,#Statement-non-opinion
and there's something about it that's so innovative, you know,#Statement-opinion
he'll have trouble picking up his hat, or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind, or something,#Statement-non-opinion
but there's something about it that just, it isn't just slapstick,#Statement-opinion
there's something about the human character in it#Statement-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's what I find lacking in a lot of, you know, like HOME ALONE.#Statement-non-opinion
There was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Other
and there was a lot of human character there,#Statement-opinion
but when it was, the real slapstick moments, him versus the criminals kind of thing, it just sort of lost the human element#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and became purely a caricature#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
does that make since to you?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
uh-huh,#Yes answers
yeah,#Yes answers
I see what you're saying,#Statement-non-opinion
there's less character development, rather just the, the, the funniness of the gag,#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
rather than#Other
Did you go with kids though?#Yes-No-Question
and how it fits with the character , right.#Summarize/reformulate
Did you go with kids?#Yes-No-Question
Excuse me?#Signal-non-understanding
Did you take kids along?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
we went, uh, without the kids,#Statement-non-opinion
it's was a night out, away from the children.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I would have liked to have a kid with me, I think, preferably someone seven or eight#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just, just to get a sense for, you know, how, how it affected them.#Other
.#Non-verbal
especially to come home#Other
and, you know, I would have gotten in trouble the next day,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sure.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Agree/Accept
that, that's true.#Statement-opinion
I, I was thinking about that too,#Statement-non-opinion
I saw that, um,#Statement-non-opinion
that's why I watched another silly movie, um, um, with my cousin, was uh, uh, the one about the, um, the turtles,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES.#Collaborative Completion
Right#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I saw that with my cousin, just to see what, you know, what the kids are into#Statement-non-opinion
And your cousin's a kid,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
and that is,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Yes answers
he's a little#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he's,#Uninterpretable
anyway, and that was just excessively violent.#Statement-opinion
I was worried#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
isn't it amazing.#Appreciation
it's like golly,#Statement-opinion
if kids start imitating that#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they'll knock each others blocks off,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was all bloodless#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the good guys can get hit all day long#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they have to shake it off#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they don't, they don't, you know, get, uh, epileptics, that sort of thing from getting hit on their head#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, it's a little disturbing the violence in these films,#Statement-opinion
partly it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on the other hand it makes it seem like,#Other
I read an article one time talking about even the quote unquote realistic movies, don't have very realistic upsets of the violence.#Statement-non-opinion
The violence can seem very realistic,#Statement-non-opinion
but the aftermath is usually not there.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So you see people who are severely injured, very, very badly, lose control of body functions#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they thrash around,#Statement-non-opinion
they scream, you know, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just a very, very bad thing,#Statement-opinion
and they never present that,#Statement-opinion
even the movies that want to show violence as real, they don't really show you what happens with that real violence#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I'm not really sure how I feel about that.#Hedge
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, on the one hand I'd like it to be a warning,#Statement-non-opinion
on the other hand I wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee, now we want to see the aftermath all the time either.#Statement-non-opinion
You're right,#Statement-opinion
uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's true.#Statement-opinion
But#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES was sort of the same way,#Statement-opinion
they, I guess they figured, I mean, they know what they're doing,#Statement-opinion
and they make the movies good enough, I guess I'm a bit of a snob, they make the movies good enough to be successful#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then they don't, and they, but they could make them better, you know#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they could try to make,#Statement-opinion
I mean, as far as I was concerned, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES could have been a classic of world theater#Statement-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
, it could have been, you know,#Statement-opinion
it was, it was innovative, uh, a completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways,#Statement-opinion
and yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable, because the, the story was stupid, and, and then things like that,#Statement-opinion
and they built up,#Statement-non-opinion
I remember feeling annoyed, again, I didn't have a kid with me, and I remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the Master and the passing of wisdom, the, from older to younger generation,#Statement-non-opinion
it was, it was a classic Greek, you know, you know, a sort of, European mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, and he had to ,#Uninterpretable
and he told them, remember , remember, you were united, you can succeed, individually you will fail#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then there was a big climactic fight scene,#Statement-non-opinion
and they didn't remember that,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
they didn't fight together,#Statement-non-opinion
they fought individually,#Statement-non-opinion
and they failed individually,#Statement-non-opinion
and then that was it,#Statement-non-opinion
then they had to have the Master beat him#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the Master should, according to the classic myth, the sort of Joseph Campbell type myth, he, the Master should have died at the end#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because the, the lesson was passed to the young generation#Other
and the older generation is not needed#Statement-non-opinion
and is reborn to the younger generation,#Statement-non-opinion
and on and on and on, and all this wonderful mess#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they had included all this stuff that, I, anyway as an intellectual adult would appreciate,#Statement-non-opinion
it wouldn't have hurt the movie to do that,#Statement-opinion
and it would have make it, uh, broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for, I thought#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, I, uh, I'm truly enough, you know, I'm truly an intellectual snob,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to be going to these kinds of movies,#Other
I realize that. I mean, to go to these movies and expect them to be, you know, other than just, just good entertainment#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
kind of thing.#Other
That's true.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
there's not too many that are, uh, that are good just on their, you know, that, that you wouldn't want to change something,#Statement-opinion

Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, I, I'm very, I'm very critical,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I, I'm actually originally from Hollywood,#Statement-non-opinion
and then, then, then#Uninterpretable
Oh, really.#Appreciation
and my father works in films#Statement-non-opinion
and such,#Uninterpretable
and I tend to, tend to be hypercritical#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
of these things,#Other
and then, perhaps, perhaps it's unfair, because I, I, I must admit I enjoy these movies#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's what they're for,#Statement-opinion
but I don't, don't remember them,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it's, I think, I can think of movies I have less fun during#Statement-non-opinion
and then after the movie's over, I remember it so terribly well#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because it, it had some, some meaning to me or something.#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
exactly,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
there, there, there are several movies that hit home like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Of course the ones I always remember are the, the older ones#Statement-non-opinion

but it just,#Uninterpretable
I mean, I don't know if this is old fart talking here#Hedge
No,#Reject
it could be.#Maybe/Accept-part
or something, because I'm not that old#Other

you know, those old movies seemed to have had something#Statement-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, I guess I usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a, a potato dish,#Statement-non-opinion
and we usually serve fresh fruit and, uh, then make a dessert.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that sounds good.#Appreciation
So that makes,#Uninterpretable
Uh, we're not, uh, real wealthy at the moment.#Statement-non-opinion
Last time I had people over for dinner we had lasagna,#Statement-non-opinion
and I used my mother's recipe,#Statement-non-opinion
I really like it.#Statement-non-opinion
It's got, um,#Uninterpretable
you cook the noodles and make, and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it#Statement-non-opinion
and, I'm not sure she even puts,#Statement-non-opinion
must be some Italian spices in there.#Statement-non-opinion
I can't remember.#Statement-non-opinion
But, um, for the cheese part, you mix, uh, sour cream, and cream cheese and cottage cheese#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that sounds good.#Appreciation
and, uh, layer all that.#Other
It's good.#Statement-non-opinion
That sounds good.#Appreciation
And, then, uh, uh, tossed salad and, and, um, Oh,#Statement-non-opinion

So.#Uninterpretable
Oh, well, lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've heard, you know, I've heard a lot of people say, it, the short cut on the cooking for lasagna,#Statement-non-opinion
they, they've told me that they go to Sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna.#Statement-non-opinion
I've heard that Sam's has a really good lasagna#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
in fact I think I had it at a, at a party once.#Statement-non-opinion
Did you?#Backchannel in question form
It was good.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I, I know people that have, have served it#Statement-non-opinion
and they say, gosh, if you have company coming#Statement-non-opinion
Easy#Collaborative Completion
when you don't want to be always in the kitchen, it's easy,#Other
and she said it's, they said it's good.#Statement-non-opinion

Oh, I know.#Appreciation
I cook, guess I cook a, seems like I cook a lot of dinners, oh, not always for company, just for, just for family.#Statement-non-opinion

So, feels like I'm often in the kitchen.#Statement-non-opinion
Not my favorite place, but.#Statement-opinion
But a time consuming place.#Collaborative Completion
A necessity#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so.#Uninterpretable
Let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
what else do we like to have for,#Self-talk
trying to think what else I like to serve.#Hold before answer/agreement
My mother likes to serve taco grandes.#Statement-non-opinion
Have you ever had,#Yes-No-Question
I don't know,#Other answers
that?#Other
what that is.#Statement-non-opinion
No#No answers
I don't know what that is.#Statement-non-opinion
You take a flour tortilla#Statement-non-opinion
and you fry it like a taco#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
shell#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you, uh,#Uninterpretable
for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some, um, tomato sauce in it,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and I like to just add picante sauce to get the Mexican flavor#Statement-non-opinion
so you don't have to mess with spices and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, then, um, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
and then, and you heat up refried beans,#Statement-non-opinion
and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese,#Statement-non-opinion
and what you do to make it, you take the shell and you spread the beans on first,#Statement-non-opinion
then you put the meat,#Statement-non-opinion
then you put the grated cheese,#Statement-non-opinion
and then you put, um,#Statement-non-opinion
let's see, what's next,#Hold before answer/agreement
then, and I, I usually put the cut up tomatoes next#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then the, um, lettuce,#Other
and you can put, uh, like guacamole and#Statement-non-opinion
Katy, I'm on the phone.#3rd-party-talk
Well, get a towel or go change.#3rd-party-talk
I'm on the phone.#3rd-party-talk
Um, oh a little sour cream is good#Statement-non-opinion

Do you like to make your own guacamole?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, yeah.#Yes answers
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we, we don't make it very often, I guess,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
No,#Agree/Accept
I don't very often.#Statement-non-opinion
Usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain#Statement-non-opinion
Oh do they?#Backchannel in question form
so. Yeah.#Uninterpretable
Gosh,#Appreciation
I just cut slices off#Statement-non-opinion

Oh, well, we made, I made guacamole that I would take to a pool party across the street the other day,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad.#Statement-non-opinion
What you want.#3rd-party-talk
wh-, where do they get it?#Wh-Question
Well, I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess they don't have it at home,#Statement-opinion
I can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to,#Statement-opinion
I guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe.#Statement-opinion
They must, they just said they never had it at home.#Statement-non-opinion
So I, I was concerned that, I thought, oh, taking this, you know, taking this as a dip, I thought, gosh, you know, sometimes when we have it at home it, it turns dark on the top#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so quickly,#Other
so I just,#Uninterpretable
It helps if you, I helps if you leave the pit in it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, does that help?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing, especially while you're waiting before you serve it.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well,#Uninterpretable
That's supposed to help keep the, um, keep it from turning brown so quick.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I'll have to remember that.#Offers, Options Commits
Well, I just, I, that day I just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top#Statement-non-opinion
and it really stayed longer than I#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
ever thought it would,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
Oh, that's good.#Appreciation
I thought maybe that was the trick.#Statement-non-opinion
That probably helps, too.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so. Oh, well. I guess we bought a lot of,#Statement-non-opinion
we've been buying turkey lately, instead of beef,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Do you want it?#3rd-party-talk
even though, you know,#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we have too,#Statement-non-opinion
the ground turkey, it's, the meat is softer#Statement-non-opinion
and I,#Uninterpretable
everybody#Statement-non-opinion
Do you want scrambled?#3rd-party-talk
seems to like it.#Other
So. Sometimes it seems to be cheaper, too,#Statement-non-opinion
so we#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
often buy it#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we buy it,#Statement-non-opinion
if you get it on sale,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so we bought that#Statement-non-opinion
or we bought the, the filets, and then the chicken, or turkey nuggets,#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
unless you tell them.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

I don't sit and watch them but, but I enjoy some of it and especially if I'm, uh, cooking on a Saturday evening or something,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and one of those is on, it kind of inspires me.#Statement-non-opinion
That sounds like a good idea.#Appreciation
I notice that, um, since we moved here that we, we did get the cable T V,#Statement-non-opinion
and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I record some.#Statement-non-opinion
And then, uh, we have just totally cut down,#Statement-non-opinion
and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and then,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and watch and then record over it, something else.#Other
And so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we do some of that,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
In fact, I probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on T V,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than, you know, other kinds of things.#Other
Well, that's probably what I watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies#Statement-non-opinion
and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that I have really enjoyed that I'm seeing for the first time#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like the MARX BROTHERS and things like that.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
those are pretty good#Statement-opinion
I, I like those old ones,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
much better than some of the new stuff.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so we, we have really enjoyed that#Statement-non-opinion
and it's really nice not to be running out.#Statement-non-opinion
Some of the video rentals can be expensive#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, boy,#Collaborative Completion
the movie can be unbelievable.#Collaborative Completion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something.#Statement-non-opinion
So we,#Uninterpretable
I have,#Uninterpretable
and it's so convenient at home#Statement-non-opinion
and you can do it anytime y-, you take the notion.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so, I have really enjoyed that#Statement-non-opinion
but, but there are,#Uninterpretable
I do have friends that watch programs#Statement-non-opinion
like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it.#Statement-non-opinion
They have some programs that they won't miss.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm not that hung up to most things.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I mean if I miss something big deal#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, and things are repeated,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's true.#Appreciation
so often that you know if, if I have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if I ever decide to tune it in again,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the only one I've ever seen and it'll be showing again.#Statement-non-opinion
Pretty funny.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, T V is something that we try an-, to not, um, deliberately try not to get hung up on it,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like you say.#Other
We do too.#Statement-non-opinion
Too many other things to do and too much going on.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we don't want our kids to, to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
spare time.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
I agree.#Agree/Accept
So it's a little bit, something that we try doing#Statement-non-opinion
and there's, there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you could say, oh, that's a good program for them because it's educational#Statement-non-opinion
but still you want them to go out and do other things.#Statement-non-opinion
Even if they're,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Anyway. Well,#Other
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, we probably exhausted that, huh?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
That was pretty good#Statement-opinion
I, I like that#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, I guess it's time to go.#Action-directive
Okay.#Agree/Accept
I enjoyed talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Yes.#Conventional-closing
Nice to have spoken with you, too.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Good-bye.#Conventional-closing

There we go.#Other
Okay.#Other
Well, uh, what do you think about taxes,#Open-Question
do you think we're paying too much?#Yes-No-Question
Yes and no.#Other answers
Income tax, no.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh, I look at it this way, uh, you've got to pay for the privilege of living here.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, being a, uh, a rec vehicle owner,#Statement-non-opinion
well, in fact, I live in a motor home.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm a ful-, what they call a full timer#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it burns gas like crazy.#Statement-non-opinion
I only get seven miles to the gallon.#Statement-non-opinion
I really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes#Statement-opinion
and they call it, uh, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
what's the word they use,#Wh-Question
anyway, a, a luxury tax.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They ga-, add it on on to tires and gasoline, cigarettes, liquor.#Statement-non-opinion
It doesn't bother me any because I've quit drinking#Statement-opinion
and I quit smoking.#Statement-non-opinion
So, that doesn't bother me#Statement-opinion
but I don't think it's fair.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's too, um, um, it's attacking just certain people.#Statement-opinion
How true.#Agree/Accept
Even with the gasoline tax.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, gasoline, especially, in this part of the country we all use it all the time, you know,#Statement-opinion
it's, that's not what I would consider a luxury.#Statement-opinion
No.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, fifty years ago the automobile was a luxury#Statement-opinion
but it's a necessity today#Statement-opinion
and, uh, as hard as they try to get these public transit things going I have never seen nor heard of one that really got of the ground.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or that accomplish what they set out to com-, to accomplish.#Other
What are your feelings on it?#Open-Question
Well, um, I, I think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it and how it's being managed and so forth.#Statement-opinion
I mean, I, I think there could be a better system#Statement-opinion
and we would get more for our money.#Statement-opinion
It's totally out of our hands#Statement-opinion
so we don't, we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes#Statement-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
That, that's, that's so true.#Agree/Accept
I mean, they say well, you voice your opinion, uh, uh, uh, on election day.#Statement-opinion
But not really.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
you don't.#Agree/Accept
Look what happened on the last presidential election,#Statement-opinion
read my lips.#Quotation
.#Non-verbal
And what happened they turned around and double crossed us.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, I mean, you can't believe what you hear.#Statement-opinion
Well, I think too,#Statement-opinion
one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by Congress and, uh, that don't seem to have any validity at all.#Statement-opinion
I mean, they're always far out#Statement-opinion
and, uh, you know, they're studying some obscure bug, you know,#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in some other part of the world or some such thing,#Other
Uh, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and our tax money pays for those things#Statement-opinion
and I think that's wrong.#Statement-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
I agree#Agree/Accept
and, and, uh, I, I also think we extend too much help to other, uh, countries#Statement-opinion
we need enough help here in this country.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
They're still people starving people here *#Statement-opinion
why should we help starving people somewhere else.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
And I think here lately they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize we're the nation in trouble.#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
Now I can't wait for, uh,#Statement-opinion
I, I could just picture wha-, what's going to happen here in the not to distant future.#Statement-opinion
We keep hearing well, we're going to receive, uh, eight billion dollars from Japan for the, uh, uh-huh, the, the, the big,#Statement-opinion
The war.#Collaborative Completion
war over there in the Mideast.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, so many billions of dollars here and there and everything#Statement-opinion
and, uh, the next thing you know we'll be turning around just like we did to Poland#Statement-opinion
and say, well, just forget it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think that's a mistake.#Statement-opinion
Oh, definitely.#Agree/Accept
Somewhere, you know, we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away.#Statement-opinion
Well, another thing now they keep decontrolling different things.#Statement-opinion
First, it was the airlines then it was banks and, and, uh, um, savings association,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and whatnot.#Other
We know what trouble they got into#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
And the same with the airlines back in the days when they were, uh, controlled and, and, uh, Transcontinental or, um, um, Interstate, uh, Trucking.#Statement-opinion
I mean, as soon as the federal government gave up control on all that, they just went to hell in a hand basket.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Prices went sky high.#Statement-opinion
Then, in, in the case of airlines, of course, they became highly competitive#Statement-opinion
and they cut each others throats until they're, they reach the point where they're cutting their own throat.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, well, of course, that's getting away from taxes isn't it,#Yes-No-Question
th-, that's government controlled.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, I, I think another thing too that, um, I've had a little contacted with, uh,#Statement-opinion
in regard to taxes let's say that, uh, you have something that the I R S disagrees with or, you know, says, hey, we're not going to allow that.#Statement-opinion
Well, I think they're very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you, you will not only payback that that you wrote off#Statement-opinion
but you will at least double that amount#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Oh, by the time you get through with the, uh#Summarize/reformulate
Yes.#Yes answers
And that's, to me there's something wrong there, you know.#Statement-opinion
the penalties.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, I can see paying the interest and some small penalty#Statement-opinion
but they really stick it to you big time.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I agree.#Agree/Accept
I think the I R S is, uh, just too powerful.#Statement-opinion
There should be some sort of a control on it.#Statement-opinion
And they should be a little more humane.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
Uh, the, uh, typical bureaucratic, I guess. That's, that's one of my pet peeves.#Statement-opinion
I came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the, the budget.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Very simple.#Statement-opinion
Give, uh, uh, uh, government employees the average number of, uh, holidays as the, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
private industry.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you think about it now,#Statement-opinion
they, they get about sixteen holidays a year.#Statement-opinion
That's a lot.#Statement-opinion
It sure is.#Agree/Accept
And I think here at TI we get, what is it nine or ten?#Statement-opinion
Well, I haven't counted.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I would have guessed eight even#Statement-non-opinion
but you might be right.#Statement-opinion
I don't have any idea.#Statement-opinion
Well, I remember, uh, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
thinking, I think it was the last time I did hear that we get about the average.#Statement-opinion
Maybe even a little more, a day or so more than the average.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, government is ridiculous.#Statement-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
Just think of the money they could save.#Action-directive
I mean, they're, they're paying out this money anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Why not get the work out of the people.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, well, anyway that would, of course, eventually come back to taxes.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, as far as income tax is concerned, I can't complain too much about it.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I'm single,#Statement-non-opinion
I have no, uh, dependents or anything,#Statement-non-opinion
my children are all grown#Statement-non-opinion
and they're out worrying about their own income taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I, I have another thing that I thought about too, for instance, when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is#Statement-opinion
and, you know, we're not typically talking about big dollars#Statement-opinion
but here you feel like you've, you've done something good#Statement-opinion
you've, you've earned your interest#Statement-opinion
and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it.#Statement-opinion
So, the real amount of your savings on that is, is, not much.#Statement-opinion
Uh, very true.#Agree/Accept
That's,#Uninterpretable
You know, it's kind of a vicious circle there.#Statement-opinion
And then they tell you to, uh, well, invest it in, uh, is it I R A -s or something#Statement-opinion
and, and,#Statement-opinion
And then,#Statement-opinion
when you turn,#Other
at a took that away as far as being,#Other
When you turn sixty-five why then you pay the tax on it#Other
and the tax is a lot less.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But in the mean time you've got your money tide up in a low, relatively low interest bearing investment.#Statement-opinion
I mean, it's not making ten, fifteen percent like a business is today.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, me I'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
Well, you can come over to my house and spend it#Action-directive
Well, you,#Yes-No-Question
I wish I had some to spend.#Statement-non-opinion
well, do you, do you need some help spending yours?#Other
No.#No answers
No.#No answers
I just don't have any.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Response Acknowledgement
Well, that's my problem too.#Statement-opinion
I'm, I'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that's going to get paid.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's the way it goes#Appreciation
Well, I guess we probably talked just about long enough.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, let me ask you something.#Offers, Options Commits
Did you get a catalog or something from these people?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
You did?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
I've, everybody I've talked to has received one#Statement-non-opinion
but I haven't gotten mine.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I don't know.#Hedge
Um, well, anyway Ellen, it was nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
You too.#Conventional-closing
And, uh, until next time.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Good-bye.#Conventional-closing

Hi.#Conventional-opening
What do you think about gun control?#Wh-Question
Well, uh, sort of mixed feelings about it, I guess, uh, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I s-, I lean more towards the control side than, than towards, you know, just the, the free, free army.#Statement-opinion
Uh, on the other hand I, it's, it's sort of an issue of, of uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not, I'm not a great fan of, of government control in general#Statement-non-opinion
and so it's, it's kind of a tough issue.#Statement-non-opinion
What about yourself?#Open-Question
Well, I guess that I would like to, to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or, uh, have a legitimate use for the, the, the weapon I suppose#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because also, living in this area, the, the problems in D C come home very quickly.#Other
I'm, I'm sure,#Appreciation
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Uh, so you would take a position where somebody without, without a, uh, uh, specific use,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
in other words, if they just wanted to have a, a gun to have in their home, uh, you wouldn't, you wouldn't like them to be able to do that?#Yes-No-Question
Is that,#Yes-No-Question
Well, I'm not so sure about that,#Other answers
but I think somehow, uh, safety courses#Statement-opinion
or, I don't know whether this could be something that was done in school,#Statement-non-opinion
but somehow people,#Uninterpretable
I'd like to know that the people who had them at least knew what the responsibilities were, whether they followed them or not.#Statement-opinion
You know, at least there's the moral issue that they, they knew better.#Statement-opinion
Uh,#Other
Which is sort of, you know, flaky,#Other
but still,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Other
I, I have, uh, I have the impression that, that the, the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not, are, are probably not from the people that are, are buying them through legitimate channels anyway.#Statement-opinion
Uh, that may be wrong.#Hedge
Uh, you know, I mean, certainly there, there are cases of, of, you know, children who find their parents' gun or something and, and shoot a brother or sister or, you know, things like that that need to be definitely avoided#Statement-opinion
and that's, that's certainly within the channels,#Statement-opinion
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, a lot of the, the crime, I think, that goes on, I, I don't know to what the degree the guns are, are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know,#Hedge
this morning in our paper, it, there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license,#Statement-non-opinion
so he went over there and got a driver's license, the same day bought three guns and went up to New York and sold them for, you know, very high markups.#Statement-non-opinion
Now, in a sense, that's a legal#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
way of getting the guns,#Other
but certainly the#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the purpose is not very legal.#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Uninterpretable
I, I mean, I think, uh, some sta-,#Uninterpretable
or, I, I don't know if it's been actually been implemented,#Statement-non-opinion
I think so, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
or at least there's been talk about doing, uh, you know, like waiting periods and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and things like that.#Other
Uh, and, and, uh, you know, I, I think stuff like that is perfectly good.#Statement-opinion
I mean, basically, if you, if you don't intend to do anything stra-, you know, if you, if you're buying it for legitimate purposes, waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and, and, things.#Other
I don't know,#Hedge
I've, you know,#Uninterpretable
I, I don't own a gun and, and don't really want one,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and I'd just as soon a lot fewer people did.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but on the other hand, you know, uh, like I say, I kind of, kind of against government control in general.#Statement-opinion
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I suppose com-, uh, you know, c-, total ban would lead to more illegal weapons.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I, you know,#Uninterpretable
something about banning is that, you know, there, there are so many weapons out there that, that they're not going to disappear anytime soon.#Statement-opinion
Uh, and they're already,#Uninterpretable
I know there's a ready market for them, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
in the s-,#Uninterpretable
the stolen, stolen guns can be sold.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, the first thing a, a, a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because, uh, because they, they can be so easily sold#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, they're, they're,#Uninterpretable
I don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, it's not like they're going to disappear all of a sudden. Uh, even if you do do a total ban on them.#Statement-opinion
Uh, it's a real tough problem.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I don't know,#Hedge
I don't know where I really come down on it.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I, I grew up,#Statement-non-opinion
my father was a hunter,#Statement-non-opinion
right,#Yes-No-Question
and that's, and that's sort of almost a separate issue.#Statement-opinion
I think we've generally been talking about handguns and that kind of thing,#Statement-opinion
right?#Tag-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
You know#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
But that's true.#Agree/Accept
I mean, some people grew up with guns in the house.#Statement-non-opinion
We never had any in the house#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, to me, the, you know, the first time I saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Other
And I'm not sure that's good either.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Other
well we, you know, we, I grew up with them.#Statement-non-opinion
I never really took to hunting.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I did some of it,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, you know, we didn't have any, we never had any handguns or anything like that.#Statement-non-opinion
We had, you know, had shotguns for, for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, it was a whole different thing#Statement-non-opinion
and, and gun safety was taken very seriously#Statement-non-opinion
and it was, you know,#Uninterpretable
I mean, before we go hunting, we, we took safety courses, uh, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, and it,#Uninterpretable
but, you know, that's, that seems to me to be just a whole another issue.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you know, the, the thing,#Uninterpretable
the, the,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
I'm not certain that people are, are, are terribly concerned about other people.#Statement-opinion

Seem to have the topic already on top of th-, tip of your tongue there#Statement-opinion
so why don't you go ahead and start.#Action-directive
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Isn't the, uh, the subject auto repair,#Yes-No-Question
Yes, sir.#Yes answers
for tonight?#Other
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
That's great.#Appreciation
The reason I say that is pretty timely because just tonight I went out and changed the oil in my car#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's something I like to do and, uh, something I, something I can do with now the sophisticated auto,#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
cars we have today with all the computers and everything.#Other
.#Non-verbal
It's, uh, and there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car,#Statement-opinion
but I do like to get out and tinker with a car#Statement-non-opinion
and it's something I can do still.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you enjoy working with your car?#Yes-No-Question
I sure do.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I, uh, in fact, the last thing I have, I've done I, I don't even remember what it is.#Statement-non-opinion
I've had to have oil changes done myself because I live in an apartment complex,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
where we are not allowed to,#Other
Oh, dear.#Appreciation
work on our vehicle.#Other
We can't even wash our vehicle,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Oh, that's too bad.#Appreciation
Uh, but the last thing I can remember doing wh-,#Statement-non-opinion
I had a sixty-six Mustang,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that was all right because like you said that was pre technology days, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, you know, you could do a lot of it yourself still,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I didn't tinker too much with the engine.#Statement-non-opinion
It was, it was in pretty good shape,#Statement-non-opinion
but my main concern and what I enjoy doing was, was the interior.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, it was, it was pretty shelled, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was fun.#Statement-non-opinion
It was taking the whole thing, you know, the whole interior apart and, you know, ordering new carpeting and, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
And did you install all that yourself?#Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Well, that was,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
And,#Uninterpretable
I bet that was a lot of fun.#Other
It, it was.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I, my wife enjoyed, uh, she, you know, helped out a little.#Statement-non-opinion
We sanded down the, the insides of the door panels.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And painted,#Other
Wow.#Appreciation
those and,#Other
Do you still have the car?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I sold it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's too bad.#Appreciation
A sixty-seven Chev-, uh, Mustang is about the, uh, top, top year for the Mustang car.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it was fun though.#Statement-non-opinion
It was fun.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I really enjoyed it,#Statement-non-opinion
and I was surprised at, at, uh, the availability of parts yet.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, you can, you can still get factory original parts.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
But, uh, you pay a premium#Statement-non-opinion
but you just don't get them.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I didn't.#Statement-non-opinion
I went ahead and got, you know, Japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made,#Statement-non-opinion
Canada.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, prefabs and all that stuff#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Well, you know, that's, that's fine.#Appreciation
I, I don't think that there would be, uh, you know, a, a quality difference.#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
You wouldn't, you didn't notice the difference, did you?#Yes-No-Question
Well, actually there was.#Dispreferred answers
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
And, uh, I had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate certain patterns, uh, exactly.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so like the, the glove box was just a little,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
little wider,#Other
Oh, dear.#Appreciation
little harder to fit in,#Other
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the carpeting, uh, stretched a little too far.#Other
I had to cut some of the sides down.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, dear.#Appreciation
But just, just little things.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, one of the screws on, on the door regulat-, uh, window regulators#Statement-non-opinion
you could get three of the, three of the four to lineup.#Statement-non-opinion
The fourth one you couldn't get to lineup no matter what you did.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Yes-No-Question
You know, thin-,#Uninterpretable
I bet that was frustrating, wasn't it?#Other
Oh, it was#Affirmative non-yes answers
but,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
the end result is after you put your, your panels on, nobody sees that you got one screw missing in your, your window regulator anyway#Other
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
it, it runs. It works just the same,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's, that's true.#Agree/Accept
Well, you know, that, that is something I really enjoy doing. Um, working on our car too,#Statement-non-opinion
the, uh, I just changed my oil, oil tonight#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I enjoy also working on things like the brakes#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, in fact, just two weeks ago I helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, either if it's a drum or, or disc brakes, I enjoy working on those kind of things.#Statement-non-opinion
Disc brakes don't seem to give me too much problem#Statement-non-opinion
but I, I honestly don't have the tools for the drum.#Statement-non-opinion
I know you got, uh, certain spring lever that you got to have or some, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Spoons and,#Collaborative Completion
some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch.#Other
Yes,#Agree/Accept
you do#Agree/Accept
Uh, my dad has got all that#Statement-non-opinion
and, and I, I helped him when I was growing up,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I don't have that stuff now,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because of the drum brakes I, you know, don't have any choice but to take them in.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
And, you know, it, it doesn't, doesn't hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too#Statement-opinion
because, um, I was helping my neighbor out#Statement-non-opinion
and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't have, of course, the equipment to do that,#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so he took it into a shop and had it resur-, uh, resurfaced and, and fixed that way.#Statement-non-opinion
But, yeah,#Uninterpretable
it is true, uh, you know,#Statement-opinion
I did have a sixty-four Ford truck that I wish I still had and loved to get inside that and tinker around with it and work with it,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because you didn't have all the extra, extra stuff,#Other
.#Non-verbal
that's in there now.#Other
I'll tell you what.#Hold before answer/agreement
The other, the nicest thing about them is, uh, everything was standard.#Statement-non-opinion
You didn't have to worry about finding a metric anything.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Boy, I tell you.#Hold before answer/agreement
And you know,#Uninterpretable

Do you think that there's any way that, uh,#Yes-No-Question
or do you think there's too much crime now?#Yes-No-Question
I mean, I guess,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
any crime is too much#Other
but,#Statement-opinion
Uh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
It's out of control.#Other
Uh, well, uh, out of control, I don't know.#Reject
I guess it could be worse.#Statement-opinion
Uh, we've, uh, we've, we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, there's, uh, there's a lot of problems.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, there's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, you know, we get c-, cars on our block, uh, regularly, uh, uh, g-, uh, gone through, rifled through and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
I would not of, okay, I would not have guessed that in Seattle.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you figured it was like Omaha, right?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
.#Non-verbal
You know.#Uninterpretable
No,#Reject
it's, uh, it's not Newark,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, yeah#Statement-opinion
it's got problems.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I wonder, I mean, I wonder what, what really is the answer.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it seems like our, our, the prison systems, we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think most people regard it as a warehouse.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Where you put away the people that are so bad that, uh, you don't want them out in circulation.#Other
But, but the problem is, is that we, we only have but so much room#Statement-opinion
and we, we try to put aside in the warehouse,#Statement-non-opinion
and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
commit crimes#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
That's what I hear.#Agree/Accept
So it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I think, you know,#Uninterpretable
don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea?#Yes-No-Question
I get the feeling that a lot of people have.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I'm not convinced that I have.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, see, I mean, my mom taught English as a second language#Statement-non-opinion
and, and she was dealing mostly with people that were, were in on drug crimes#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Oh, you mean she taught in a prison?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In a#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia.#Other
uh.#Uninterpretable
And, the problem she had was not with the inmates at all.#Statement-non-opinion
The, the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I mean,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the b-, the bureaucracy.#Summarize/reformulate
It was, it was, I mean,#Other
they, they put her, I mean,#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't, obviously I didn't see the classroom, uh, and, hopefully never will,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
they, they put her at the end of a hallway,#Other
there were no other classes going on at the time#Statement-non-opinion
and they refused to let her wear a body al-, a body alarm.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Uninterpretable
Which,#Other
and#Uninterpretable
I don't know exactly what that is,#Statement-non-opinion
but I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and, and really annoy a lot of people.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, you know ,#Uninterpretable
So she didn't feel safe.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
she didn't.#Statement-non-opinion
She didn't,#Statement-non-opinion
she, she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates,#Statement-non-opinion
and then later on the, uh, the administration kept getting worse,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't, she didn't feel quite as comfortable around.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, well, she had decided that it was, when we came back to the States, she decided that it was too,#Statement-non-opinion
she didn't feel that public schools were s-, were safe,#Statement-non-opinion
so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, at least it's maximum security, right#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, but the point that was, that it, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
you said that perhaps, uh, people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible#Statement-non-opinion
and, and I'm, I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in, that run the system have given up on it.#Statement-opinion
Uh, well, I, I think the people that run, yeah, that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical, you know.#Statement-opinion
Uh.#Uninterpretable
I mean, I, uh, you know, I, I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
you can get pretty hardened, I'm sure.#Statement-opinion
But getting, I mean, well, see,#Uninterpretable
I always have problems because, because I can never decide whether or not I'm, I'm supposed to be a conservative or, or a liberal#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I keep,#Statement-opinion
Those are funny labels, see .#Statement-opinion
I keep thinking that there's got to be some way, that, that a lot of this is circumstances.#Other
I mean, I can't help but wonder if, if I grew up without a father, on the streets, and#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with like little or no money, wouldn't#Other
Oh,#Agree/Accept
wouldn't I be in prison at this point?#Other
Oh, yeah,#Other
absolutely.#Agree/Accept
I think, uh, yeah, I think you can blame it on social problems.#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Agree/Accept
I mean, I don't know.#Hedge
I mean, as, as, you know, as poverty has gotten worse, as, you know, education has gotten worse, as there's been more single parent families, as there's been more homelessness, there's m-, been more crime.#Statement-opinion
We've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
there's not enough#Statement-opinion
get onto the program.#Other
beds and treatment programs, rising drug abuse,#Other
and, yep,#Agree/Accept
it's a mess.#Statement-opinion
I don't, I don't remember the, the gentleman's name,#Statement-non-opinion
but the, the, uh, the mayor of Baltimore is a, is a Rhodes Scholar#Statement-non-opinion
and what he,#Statement-non-opinion
Is he the guy wants to, like, deregulate heroin, or something?#Yes-No-Question
Well, what he wants to do is take all the money that, uh, he gets for drug enforcement and use it for, uh, drug education.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And basically, just, just attack the problem at the demand side.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Stop trying to attack supply because, which, which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't.#Statement-opinion
I mean, Switzerland tried the, the grand experiment#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable

That's my favorite team,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
that's all right.#Other
Uh, now that Randall's coming back next season, I hope they'll be, do a little bit better.#Statement-non-opinion
They didn't do too bad last season.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I hope they can do better.#Statement-non-opinion
How about yourself?#Open-Question
Well, I don't know.#Other answers
I kind of go back and forth, uh, depending on who's really hot and who's not.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I guess if I have, uh, my druthers, I'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, tha-,#Uninterpretable
I kind of like them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's another one of my favorites.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Yo-,#Uninterpretable
Seahawks are good.#Statement-opinion

Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I kind of like college actually.#Statement-non-opinion
Quite a bit.#Statement-non-opinion

That's kind of, that's kind of strange.#Statement-opinion
It's too much running for me in, in college football.#Statement-non-opinion
I like#Statement-non-opinion
Is it?#Backchannel in question form
I like the pros.#Other
They do, you know,#Uninterpretable
it's more high tech,#Statement-opinion
more, you know, players are apt to act a little bit different when they, when their jobs and their, when it's a job and not just, you know#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
That could be.#Maybe/Accept-part
when you're getting paid millions to do it, you ac-, I think they take it to another level.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I can see it's more, you know, grunted out, run the ball type.#Statement-opinion
College football is a little bit different#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then.#Statement-opinion
Who-, who's that?#Wh-Question
.#Non-verbal
Notre Dame ?#Yes-No-Question

I root for Nebraska quite a bit.#Statement-non-opinion

That, that, that's boring for me.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I'll take the passing teams any day.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But,#Uninterpretable
Well, I can see, I can see definitely how you get into that.#Statement-non-opinion
I, to be honest with you, I find th-, that too much running gets pretty boring as well#Statement-non-opinion
and.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's just, it's four yards, three yards#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
eight yards, tackle.#Other
That's, you know, it gets kind of monotonous.#Statement-opinion
After awhile, I, I prefer forty, a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just, just to#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
juice it up a little bit#Other
and but,#Uninterpretable
Well, I think they're starting to realize that.#Statement-opinion
A lot of the, like the big eight teams that used to run so much. I think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's high dollar.#Statement-opinion
You know, it's all, it's all money now.#Statement-opinion
Even college is all#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
can we get on T V#Other

I, I don't think anything will ever take over the N F L.#Statement-opinion
I think#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's basically, you know, it's, it's an institution.#Other
It's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball.#Statement-opinion
It's just, I just, you know.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, it, it, it can be, it can take over part of it.#Statement-opinion
But it's never going to be the next,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
It can take over a small market share#Statement-opinion
but nothing really,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's going to take a little bit.#Statement-opinion
Some people are going to watch it#Statement-opinion
but it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday afternoon or anything, you know.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's just, it's never going to reach that, that standard#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I think I agree with you.#Agree/Accept
It's, it's kind of interesting to see, uh, to see their claim of, you know, like world football.#Statement-non-opinion
But, when in reality, it's really Americans playing somewhere else you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
It's kind of, it's kind of strange.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I guess we're the only ones,#Statement-opinion

who take it that far.#Other
Everybody else still nuts over soccer#Statement-opinion

Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Actually, uh, I kind of like soccer.#Statement-non-opinion

That's some brutal stuff there.#Statement-opinion
That's, that's worse than football as far as violence I think.#Statement-opinion
Golly.#Appreciation
Those guys kill each other out there.#Statement-opinion
Rugby is something else.#Statement-opinion
Yeah, .#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
there's an element there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's just wild.#Statement-opinion
That's why it's a go-, a big college thing.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Rugby is definitely big in college#Statement-opinion
because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
exactly#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Tha-,#Uninterpretable
So, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I could see the feel for that.#Statement-opinion

I'll give it that.#Statement-non-opinion
It is fun to play. If you don't value your *#Statement-opinion

Well, I don't think that uh, any of my relatives would really like to go there.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I believe, if I, am in a position, uh, like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that I will be able to just bring her into my home#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my father also, and uh, or have someone go into their home, you know and uh, and look after them.#Other

You know?#Other
I do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for, you know, if you are faced with placing someone.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In a place like that, uh, you know, aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that is offered#Other

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And another thing to think about, uh, on the positive side of the nursing homes here,#Statement-opinion
I use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I got to see a lot of the things that they did#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they, uh, they had a lot of crafts#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Other
and they had a lot of games#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, they, get together and just do, they they do all sorts of things#Statement-non-opinion
and then there#Uninterpretable
some, some of the, uh, the people that are in there are real, you know, very nice and friendly to everybody#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, then there are others that are,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, it is just a job#Statement-non-opinion
and they just you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, the, the attitude of the staff as you said is really#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
very very important.#Other
I think it would matter too, uh, kinds of, uh, disabilities that the nursing home accepts.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because there are some, uh, who poor things, you know, don't have, uh, any real grasp on reality any longer.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they may be ambulatory,#Statement-non-opinion
but they tend to behave like children, small children#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that would be very difficult I think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to to have to deal with on a daily basis.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh.#Uninterpretable
Well, it is like, wel-, the one that I worked in, uh, you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day,#Statement-non-opinion
they would just roll themselves around all over the place#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities#Other
and then you would see see some of the others that are were like distant from the other group#Statement-non-opinion
and they they just didn't like participate together with the others#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because they had some some, uh, I guess, uh, slight mental disabilities and things like that.#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What, what do you call Alzheimer disease and stuff like that#Wh-Question
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Alzheimer,#Repeat-phrase
yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they don't, don't, uh, they weren't really together with the rest of them, when they got together for such activities.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that can,#Uninterpretable

So the general topic is hobbies.#Statement-non-opinion

basically, I had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it, Texas,#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Reject
all means about fifteen to twenty percent,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
of, of, oh,#Other
I'm sure the number's s-, somewhere classified#Statement-non-opinion
but some of the internal news and the news services,#Statement-non-opinion
so, it's approximately six fifty,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so ten percent of six fifty, is sixty-five#Statement-non-opinion
and twenty percent would be one thirty.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow,#Appreciation
how about that.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney.#Statement-non-opinion

Uh, I'm a defense worker.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, government tool control specialist.#Statement-non-opinion

Actually, December was my first month away from them.#Statement-non-opinion
Exempt or ?#Or-Clause
Exempt.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Response Acknowledgement
It, uh, unfortunately I guess for myself it wasn't, uh, it was purely by my own choice.#Statement-non-opinion
It wasn't, uh, there was no incentive for myself to leave,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was just an opportunity arose#Statement-non-opinion
and decided to take it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, so, you didn't even get the severance package.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
I should have taken the, the, the, you know, uh, option when that was there,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was just, I missed it by a couple months.#Statement-non-opinion
But, you know, what can one do.#Rhetorical-Questions
I'm just happy still to have a job.#Statement-non-opinion
So, are you happy with what you are doing now?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I am kind of happy with it,#Statement-non-opinion
it's getting better all the time,#Statement-non-opinion
I knew it would be different from the very beginning,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system,#Statement-non-opinion
so I was in the computer operations#Statement-non-opinion
it's, uh, you know, it all starts to become similar#Statement-non-opinion
there's, you know, there's benefits#Statement-non-opinion
and there's things that weren't as good,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but as an overall package, I'd say I'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out.#Statement-non-opinion
Good,#Appreciation

Well, it hasn't been a long time T I#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm significantly shaken by the situation,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but not devastated.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, the one thing I guess at least in your favor is the, the fact that, that is more in the support of the manufacturing#Statement-opinion
and there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the de-, the defense area but manufacturing in general.#Statement-opinion
To tell you the truth, I'm, I'm, I'm not really worried.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's great.#Appreciation
That's good.#Appreciation
And, and I seem rather happy about it most of the time,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just, just to know, what's, possibilities are,#Other
Sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, what might happen.#Other
Sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table.#Appreciation
But still in all,#Statement-non-opinion
It may be a blessing in disguise.#Statement-opinion
it feels funny.#Other
I know a number of people who are, uh, surplused#Statement-non-opinion
and they're just,#Uninterpretable
actually, what the positions that they found outside of the company were much, much better than the ones that they currently had inside.#Statement-opinion
So, despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or, or going for walks in the mountains,#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly.#Appreciation
I can't seem to get into it right now.#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I'm sure it's just with the, the, the, the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you dec-, decide on a pass ,#Statement-opinion
Uh, situational.#Uninterpretable
I've, I doubt I'll be here in six months.#Statement-non-opinion

Well, would you like to be there?#Yes-No-Question
I,#Uninterpretable
all things being equal, yes.#Affirmative non-yes answers

Sure.#Appreciation
but, God this is much better than west Texas.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, just take the day,#Uninterpretable
But then they, they tell me Hell is much better than west Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, actually, uh, the, the Plano, Dallas, Houston, you know, Austin that whole area is, is actually quite, quite nice.#Statement-opinion
I, my little brother lives in Austin right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's a beautiful place.#Statement-non-opinion
Goes to U T.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's just fantastic down there.#Statement-non-opinion
Take it more as a,#Uninterpretable
this is your opportunity to do whatever you want,#Statement-opinion
pick out where you want to live,#Action-directive
and then once you pick that spot out, pick out what you want to do.#Action-directive
I see that's the problem.#Statement-non-opinion
For the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and where I want to go.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And just kind of go with the punches.#Other
Sure.#Appreciation
And now I feel lost.#Statement-non-opinion

Oh, I had job offers.#Other answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave.#Statement-non-opinion
And that,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, the best thing about it is that you can, uh, try something#Statement-opinion
if you don't like it, shoot, move on to something else.#Action-directive
That's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here,#Statement-non-opinion
I'll take a chance,#Statement-non-opinion
if I don't like it, I'll go someplace else, do something different.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh so, had you been with T I long when you changed?#Yes-No-Question

Actually, seventeen now,#Statement-non-opinion
and, oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
momentum is, uh, driving force in our lives.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But so, yeah,#Uninterpretable
I'm looking as, as a opportunity.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's good,#Appreciation
you've got a good attitude about it.#Statement-opinion
And, and I'm looking at it as a change.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I'm looking at it as, as an adventure.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Appreciation
there you go.#Appreciation
That's the way to do it.#Appreciation
And maybe I'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I don't get laid off between now and then.#Statement-non-opinion
There you go,#Appreciation
that's the thing to do.#Appreciation
That's much funner than doing any kind of job.#Appreciation
Ha, how about we end this?#Yes-No-Question
That will work out just fine.#Other answers
Nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
All right,#Conventional-closing

Okay#Response Acknowledgement
Well, I mean it's,#Uninterpretable
With two little kids I can understand that.#Appreciation

It's that's simple.#Statement-opinion
I read to escape,#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't read any PARENTS magazines either.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
What, uh, what kind of,#Wh-Question
Well, I just finished, just, I just finished one last night. A great book.#Statement-non-opinion
It, it's very, a typical for my reading though but a great book, one called, THE THINGS THEY CARRIED by Tim O'Brien.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
God#Appreciation
I don't know if I would call it a collection of Vietnam war stories or if I'd call it a collection of Vietnam love stories.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Strange book. Beautifully written.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just beautifully written.#Statement-non-opinion
By, uh, somebody who was there#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Yes answers
a guy who was there as a, uh, foot soldier.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, he considered himself to be, you know, a, a true Vietnam soldier.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, any of the guys that were ground#Uninterpretable
yes.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
I can imagine.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, what's the latest one you've read?#Wh-Question
Well, I tell you what,#Hold before answer/agreement
I'm a kind of, uh, a history nut.#Hold before answer/agreement
I'm trying to think back now,#Hold before answer/agreement
I read an awful lot of, uh, periodicals and, uh, you know, almost what you call reference books.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the last, uh, I'm embarrassed to say the last, you know, honest to gosh, cover to cover book that I read, I cannot, right offhand, I tried to read, uh, one of the, the Michener, uh, LONE STAR or the, the TEXAS HISTORY BOOK.#Statement-non-opinion
I have never been able to make it through any of Michener's work.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, I've had similar problems.#Statement-non-opinion
It does tend to, to,#Statement-opinion
Have you, are you a Civil War buff at all?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah, as a matter of fact,#Yes answers
yeah#Yes answers
Because I finished one,#Statement-non-opinion
I think this is like two years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
and somebody had given me one of these dinky do, crappy women's novels set in the Civil War, John Jakes with ,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the novel didn't do that much for me.#Statement-non-opinion
But, boy, the period of time was fascinating.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I then read, was it BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
I think it was BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM.#Statement-non-opinion
BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM .#Repeat-phrase
It's kind of like a historical compendium,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of the Civil War,#Other
and it's not a story of the Civil War,#Statement-non-opinion
it's a story of all the politics and, uh, lobbying and just basically state by state events,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that lead to the events that brought about the Civil War.#Other
And it's fascinating because I had always, you know, been raised on this, you know, Emancipation Proclamation with the Civil War.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There was a lot more to it than that, weren't there?#Yes-No-Question
There was a lot more to it than that.#Affirmative non-yes answers
As a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, it was a political move.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because, you know, it was, uh, if you read it, it only emancipated those who were in areas, uh, in rebellion against the United States.#Statement-opinion
All the other areas which would, I think at that time would have included West Virginia and, oh, may have been Kentucky, a few states, you know, that were not part of the South but still had slaves.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They didn't emancipate them.#Statement-opinion
Well, you know what else really surprised me, now#Rhetorical-Questions
I'm married to a native Texan#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm not.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've got the same problem#Statement-non-opinion

My husband is always, you know, talked about th-, Texas being a, uh, rebel state.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, oh, my God, all this Civil War pride.#Statement-non-opinion
I kept waiting for,#Uninterpretable
where's some reference to this goddamn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War.#Rhetorical-Questions
Mayb-,#Uninterpretable
isn't much there, was there?#Yes-No-Question
They might as well have not even been there.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, they weren't a state#Statement-opinion
and the only, the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to, you know, who's going to be going there.#Statement-opinion
And I keep telling my husband that,#Statement-non-opinion
and he keeps saying, oh, no.#Statement-non-opinion
I thought, okay.#Statement-non-opinion
They supplied some, uh, you know,#Uninterpretable
they were some groups of it, the Vicksburg,#Statement-non-opinion
if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg, the battleground at Vicksburg, uh, there's an area there where there was, uh, some Texas, uh, groups#Statement-non-opinion
and they had an interesting time there.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I'll bet they did.#Agree/Accept
And down there at Sabine Pass, uh, I can't think of the guy's name#Statement-non-opinion
but he held off, uh, you know, just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story.#Statement-opinion
Well, you know, why they actually held them off?#Rhetorical-Questions
None of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar#Statement-opinion
That could be it could be it.#Maybe/Accept-part
Now, you didn't hear me say that.#Action-directive
Outside of, uh,#Uninterpretable
And then the last Civil War battle was fought at Val Verde, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
over there on the Texas border you had a lot of, of groups heading for Mexico#Statement-non-opinion
and they were cut off at the pass more or less, at Eagle Pass.#Statement-non-opinion
And they didn't get across the river there#Statement-non-opinion
so they're, the last,#Uninterpretable
and that was actually after the war was over#Statement-non-opinion
but it was the last,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
organized battle between the two units was in Texas,#Other

Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

But outside of those kind of things, you know, the other thing that I've really gotten into reading,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think this is because the kids are getting to me,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is science fiction.#Other
I've always kind of enjoyed it.#Statement-non-opinion

Well, I've gone to the point where my husband, my husband travels, I get out like, you know, two or three books.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I, I'm trying to think of, oh, Isaac Asimov, ROBOT series.#Statement-non-opinion

And, uh, the SHADOW OF BLOOMING GROVE and TWO THOUSAND AND TEN and GRANT TAKES COMMAND and THE WAR IN THE YEAR oh, SPACE that was the one I was trying to wade through was SPACE, James Michener. Didn't get very far on that.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I think I read HAWAII,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when I was about ten years old#Other
or so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which is about the developmental level that, you know, you need to be at to read those things,#Statement-opinion
and I still even then I was so, so disgusted with it I, I tried to read, I don't remember which other one it was,#Statement-non-opinion
whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I just, I got about like a hundred pages through it and realized I had like a thousand more,#Statement-non-opinion
I thought, I can't do this.#Statement-non-opinion

they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting, you know,#Statement-opinion
the,#Uninterpretable
Well, I loved that novel.#Statement-non-opinion
And then somebody said, oh, God, this would have been even long ago because I was in Boston#Statement-non-opinion
and it was raining all night,#Statement-non-opinion
and I had a hole in my roof#Statement-non-opinion
and I was waiting for the whole house to collapse,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and, uh, I was reading DUNE.#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which seeming rather ironic.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I read the whole damn book while I was home hauling out, you know, like ten-gallon buckets of, of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you're reading DUNE.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits#Other
and,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I think that's probably my favorite of, of any piece of science fiction that I've ever read.#Other
That was a movie too, wasn't it?#Yes-No-Question
And the movie was awful.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Was it?#Backchannel in question form
Oh, yes,#Yes answers
it was just terrible.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'd, I didn't see it#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Uninterpretable
It was, it was beyond, uh,#Uninterpretable
Patrick Stewart was in that.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess the guy that's on the new STAR TREK series was in that thing, uh#Yes-No-Question
I don't know,#Other answers
I just remember Sting was in it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
and if you were trying to follow any type of, uh, plot, it, it total-,#Statement-opinion
even having read the book, and I've read that book probably three times,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
watching that movie, I couldn't figure out,#Other
Couldn't,#Uninterpretable
what they were talking about,#Other
.#Non-verbal
at all.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was real disappointed in that.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I'll tell you another good book,#Hold before answer/agreement
do you like scary things?#Yes-No-Question
Um, well, some history,#Hold before answer/agreement
Have you,#Uninterpretable
books are pretty scary,#Other
but,#Uninterpretable
yeah#Yes answers
That's true.#Agree/Accept
Have you read, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
Somebody who,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they'd ever seen,#Other
they didn't sleep all night.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, see I, I am debating whether or not I want to go see the movie after having read the book.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean the book is, is chilling.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have,#Uninterpretable
Just chilling.#Statement-non-opinion
no, uh,#No answers
I don't have the foggiest notion what it's about,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Then I won't tell you.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But,#Uninterpretable
It's just that if you're ever, ever really want to just be scared out of your wits,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's the one.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
That's the one.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Yes.#Yes answers
Even better than JAWS and some of that?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
because the cat-, the, the character that is so horrible is another human being.#Statement-non-opinion
And you're just drawn into his, his horror,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
of him that you,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
begin to kind of like him.#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean,#Uninterpretable
A, a Freddy Kruger type, huh?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
no.#No answers
This guy's smart#Statement-non-opinion
and he's suave#Statement-non-opinion
and he's all the charac-, all the,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh the worst kind,#Collaborative Completion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
characteristics,#Other
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Repeat-phrase
all the characteristics ...#Uninterpretable

Why don't you go ahead and say what you feel,#Action-directive
and then I'll respond.#Statement-non-opinion
All right.#Agree/Accept
Well, I'm, uh, I'm very guilty of, of not doing my part with recycling, I'm afraid.#Statement-non-opinion
We, um, recently moved here from North Carolina,#Statement-non-opinion
and they had curbside recycling,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was very easy to, you know, to put everything out there,#Statement-non-opinion
but we don't have it in, at least in our neighborhood right now#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, so, I've been very guilty about not making the effort to, to take things where take things where they belong.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, how long have you been here?#Wh-Question
Well, we've been here since January,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
we, we still feel very new,#Other
but, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's working up to a year now,#Other
so, I guess we're old timers compared to some people.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's a good excuse.#Statement-opinion
You need to get into the#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the system a little more and know where to take things.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We've been here probably two and a half years,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and we didn't recycle at all before we came#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I think we're doing well.#Statement-non-opinion
We, we save most of our aluminum cans and glass#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and newspaper right now.#Other
Well, where do you take those things?#Wh-Question
Well, the, um, glass and the newspaper we usually take to Walmart.#Statement-non-opinion
They have, um, in behind Walmart they have bins#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then we usually save up our cans and, and change them in for money.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, where do you do that,#Wh-Question
because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um,#Other
but I didn't know where to take them.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, there's a place on Parker Road, um,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just over the overpass before you get like to K-Mart.#Statement-non-opinion
I think there's a, a service station there.#Statement-non-opinion
There's usually a semi truck that has a, a person there that will weigh them#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
Now they aren't worth much right now,#Other
but#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's better than nothing#Other
so#Uninterpretable
Better than nothing,#Repeat-phrase
right.#Agree/Accept
and what I hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the, the pickup now,#Statement-non-opinion
and we, hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of October.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and,#Statement-non-opinion
it's coming in a couple of months,#Other
but#Uninterpretable
I think it's been delayed.#Other
I think it was originally scheduled for February,#Statement-non-opinion
but the trucks that were supposed to do it, there's been some problems with#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
from what I've read in, you know, the mail that we get#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I can't wait for that,#Statement-non-opinion
that will be easy.#Statement-opinion
I get tired of newspaper littering the garage#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it gets to be a bit much to haul it off,#Statement-opinion
but.#Uninterpretable
I feel guilty we don't recycle our, our milk containers because they seem like a big waste.#Statement-opinion
Well, they, yeah they, they're a lot of bulk, anyway#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, I'll be glad when the bins do come,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think that's when I'll, I'll start doing the plastic, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was real easy with the bins,#Statement-non-opinion
it really was,#Statement-non-opinion
it was just no effort at all, um, no more trouble than taking out the garbage,#Statement-non-opinion
so, um,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've gotten used to washing the, you know, the, um, salad dressing bottles and#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
things like that,#Other
it's not that big of a deal,#Statement-opinion
and it's nicer to just throw them out,#Statement-opinion
but we can do our part#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
take an extra minute or two.#Other
Well, how much do you earn on the cans,#Wh-Question
I, I didn't know ho-, what kind of an idea to give her for,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, when we first were, were here, it was like we'd take maybe a, oh, a grocery sack full or#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
maybe two grocery sacks full,#Other
and it would be like two dollars#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar.#Other
So it's gone down.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
which is understandable,#Statement-opinion
I think, more people are#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
are recycling.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's something we, we don't really make any effort to,#Statement-non-opinion
and whatever pop we drink, we used to take the boys out for a bike ride, and pick up the litter, you know, the, the cans#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that was kind of fun,#Statement-non-opinion
but we haven't done that for a long time#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so.#Uninterpretable
Well, that sounds like a pretty good project.#Appreciation
Well, the boys think it's fun, plus you get your exercise#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest#Other
.#Non-verbal
so#Uninterpretable
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but.#Uninterpretable
Well, I'll have to keep myself and, and ge-, get on it.#Statement-non-opinion
My neighbor across the street, um, is so careful about recycling,#Statement-non-opinion
and so I keep telling myself, I'll, I'll get it organized,#Statement-non-opinion
but, may, maybe they'll beat me and, and do the city wide first.#Statement-opinion
Well, hopefully the bins will be here in this month#Statement-non-opinion
and that will spur you on,#Statement-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Right,#Agree/Accept
right,#Agree/Accept
I won't have any excuse then,#Statement-opinion
that's for sure.#Statement-opinion
All right, well, it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting,#Statement-opinion
Thinking about it, anyway#Collaborative Completion
Trying#Other
that's all you can do#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but,#Uninterpretable
so.#Uninterpretable
Well, um, have you,#Other
do they time this thing for us,#Yes-No-Question
or do we,#Or-Clause
Um, yeah,#Yes answers
you can do it as long as you want.#Statement-non-opinion
They, you know,#Uninterpretable
if it's been long enough, five minutes is, is when they cut in and say, say, we don't have any more room for recording#Statement-non-opinion
You can't chat all day, huh#Yes-No-Question
So#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
we can say good-bye now.#Other
It was good talking to you,#Conventional-closing
and maybe we'll get on line again.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Thanks, Sherry.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Hi.#Conventional-opening
Hi, uh,#Conventional-opening
as a matter of fact this past weekend, since we had a long weekend, I, uh, took on a painting project in my bathroom#Statement-non-opinion
and I had wallpaper up,#Statement-non-opinion
I had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that#Statement-non-opinion
and it took me all weekend#Statement-non-opinion
because, uh, the wallpaper, getting it off, I had to wet the walls down#Statement-non-opinion
and that had to dry.#Statement-non-opinion
And then the spackling had to dry a day#Statement-non-opinion
and then the painting took another day.#Statement-non-opinion
You didn't try re-, rewallpapering?#Yes-No-Question
You just, uh,#Uninterpretable
No.#No answers
I, I just painted.#Statement-non-opinion
Did you use a textured paint#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Uh, no.#No answers
Actually, the wall behind the paper was smooth#Statement-non-opinion
so, I just used a, like a semigloss.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
Well, did you get good results?#Yes-No-Question
Well, no,#No answers
not really.#Negative non-no answers
I need to,#Statement-non-opinion
it, it looks so,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
bad you can see where those spackling marks were.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I need to, uh, either paper back over it or do something#Statement-non-opinion
But it just didn't, it didn't, it didn't cover it?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
It covered the spots pretty good#Statement-non-opinion
but it didn't, excuse me, it didn't, uh, uh, it just didn't look as smooth as I wanted it to.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, we did a, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
we moved, oh, last August#Statement-non-opinion
and we're getting a house,#Statement-non-opinion
my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den#Statement-non-opinion
and we decided,#Uninterpretable
we went to, I've forgotten , one of the paint stores#Statement-non-opinion
and they just said, oh, you can get by,#Statement-non-opinion
and I forgotten what it was you put down, and then you can just paint right over the dark.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, more or less.#Dispreferred answers
After about, uh, half dozen coats it looks reasonable#Statement-opinion
but it kept,#Uninterpretable
the, the dark#Uninterpretable
it was, uh, just a real dark, uh, wood grain type paneling#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it was smooth#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, and we would, we put this stuff on#Statement-non-opinion
and, and it supposedly textured it or did something to it#Statement-non-opinion
and, but because of the b-, dark behind it, it was really hard to cover#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Was it like a primer?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
It was something like that, although, we sort of, when we got through I wished we hadn't done it#Statement-non-opinion
because we were, you know, we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it#Statement-non-opinion
and we were painting it and trying to do, uh, you know, make it,#Statement-non-opinion
and it, it really was, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
the advice they give you is, uh,#Uninterpretable
the job was considerably tougher than we thought.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, particularly when you try to,#Uninterpretable
I was talking to somebody else who, who had a lot of wood panelling#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate#Statement-non-opinion
and it seemed like there was, it was a good sized den with a lot panelling#Statement-non-opinion
and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my goodness,#Appreciation
that's an awful lot.#Appreciation
Have you, have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted?#Yes-No-Question
Not inside.#Negative non-no answers
Now, uh, when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it.#Statement-non-opinion
That was one of the requirements from, you know, F H A#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that the house be painted before we bought it#Other
and it was fairly reasonable.#Statement-non-opinion
We have a brick house#Statement-non-opinion
but all the trim#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
around the house was, uh,#Other
if I remember right, it was like five hundred dollars.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's quite reasonable.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
so that wasn't too bad.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, problem i-,#Uninterpretable
have you, have you tried matching paint lately?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I haven't.#Statement-non-opinion
My wife,#Uninterpretable
we, we built a shed over the long way ,#Statement-non-opinion
actually, it took,#Statement-non-opinion
this is not on the topic#Statement-non-opinion
but I did finish it.#Statement-non-opinion
But my wife went to the, uh, Home Depot, I think it was, and, and took a, uh, a copy, took a piece of brick#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and she wanted to paint the shed#Statement-non-opinion
it's, it's a wooden shed, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and she took it#Statement-non-opinion
and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, they got,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, and, in fact she put some right ba-,#Statement-non-opinion
she got,#Statement-non-opinion
they mixed, uh, a gallon of it#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and it does it, uh, oh, electronically some, something,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
magic.#Other
they did do a good job?#Other
Yeah,#Yes answers
you know, they,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's electronic.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you put your sample under this thing#Statement-non-opinion
and it looks at it in-, and, uh, and determines the,#Statement-non-opinion
and it, it's really remarkable.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, the problem they had#Statement-non-opinion
and then they wanted some gray to do the, to do the trim.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, but they didn't, didn't occur to them that, um, that they could have taken a sample#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, from,#Other
I forgotten, *#Statement-non-opinion
this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something#Statement-non-opinion
but anyway. It's, it's remarkable.#Statement-non-opinion
That's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
you want this, you want this to look like this#Statement-non-opinion
and you want that to look like that#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of course, if it's all white you're all right#Other
but when you start getting into colors,#Statement-opinion
have you had problems getting colors to match?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Yeah.#Yes answers
As a matter of fact, uh, what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a, uh, a blue#Statement-non-opinion
and the blue, even so many years, two years later or so it doesn't match,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
So,#Uninterpretable
it's the very same type of paint and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
Gosh.#Appreciation
So,#Uninterpretable
So you,#Uninterpretable
so what's your,#Wh-Question
what's the solution then?#Wh-Question
Oh, I have no idea.#Other answers
I repainted the whole thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
Well, at least you'll get very good at it, right?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
You could go back and, and paint,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
the whole thing over#Other
that's, uh, this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting#Statement-opinion
because it, uh, it seems like everybody has a, you know, to go in and do,#Statement-opinion
I'll just do a little bit here and a little there .#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Although, the, uh,#Uninterpretable
it's uh, it,#Uninterpretable
we almost one day,#Uninterpretable
we painted the house to, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
we painted, we painted the whole inside#Statement-non-opinion
and it had all this dark trim.#Statement-non-opinion
We thought, uh, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
we did the one wall but the other trim,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm trying to think,#Hold before answer/agreement
I think, I think we left most of it because it gets to be, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
they don't do that in the newer houses now#Statement-non-opinion
we don't,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the mold ,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
everything is white .#Other
In a new house everything is white.#Statement-non-opinion
White,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
That's what we're trying to get ours to look like.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, good luck#Appreciation
We wound up selling the house.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Actually, I, I don't know whether it made,#Statement-non-opinion
actually it does,#Statement-opinion
it's interesting that the white, um, makes the rooms look bigger.#Statement-opinion
One of the,#Uninterpretable
in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room, it has molding, uh, like picture frames, I don't know what you call that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that actually, that are along the walls, you know, up a couple of feet.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And my wife painted those, the insides of those dark blue.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Appreciation
And, uh, it makes the room look remarkably smaller.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh. She painted the insides dark blue and then the trim,#Declarative Wh-Question
The trim,#Statement-non-opinion
what color ?#Other
is still white.#Other
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
The,#Uninterpretable
White.#Repeat-phrase
the molding#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but by,#Uninterpretable
and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it makes the room look smaller which is, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, which is,#Other
.#Non-verbal
it explains why they, why they have everything white#Statement-opinion
but I,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you wouldn't think that I,#Other
well, maybe,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff#Other
but,#Uninterpretable
Well, uh, what about the lighting?#Wh-Question
Did it make a big difference?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, not particularly#Negative non-no answers
because the house has so many windows#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Response Acknowledgement
uh, it has#Uninterpretable
the, the, the living room has four, uh, good size windows#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, well, of course, at night#Statement-non-opinion
but with the,#Uninterpretable
we have, we have a soccer field#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's, um, oh, about a hundred yards from our house#Other
and the lights shine right at our house.#Statement-non-opinion
It's kind of,#Uninterpretable
we didn't know that when we bought the house#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
So that, uh,#Uninterpretable
you get some,#Uninterpretable
the color doesn't really matter for, because you have that light.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
We have a lot of light,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Yes answers
And, well, it, it, it, um, well, it's just, uh, I think it's just the, the, the dark blue to about three feet#Statement-non-opinion
and then above that we left it white#Statement-non-opinion
so. Anyway, it didn't,#Statement-non-opinion
I see .#Appreciation
it didn't change#Other
but the, the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away#Statement-non-opinion
it didn't,#Uninterpretable
it kind of bled under the masking tape which, I guess, is probably the topic we're#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we're really on to that, that the masking is,#Other
you have to do that very, very carefully.#Statement-non-opinion
And it takes a long time,#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
You can work yourself to death.#Statement-opinion
Well, I'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Really,#Agree/Accept
no kidding.#Agree/Accept
It's kind of frustrating.#Statement-opinion
It is.#Agree/Accept
A lot of work,#Statement-opinion
a lot of work.#Statement-opinion
Well, I've got to go to a meeting.#Statement-non-opinion
It's been good talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Good-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye#Conventional-closing

Okay,#Other
while I was waiting for you to connect, I, I thought of a couple of menus,#Statement-non-opinion
so I decided it had to be in it, informal or not.#Statement-non-opinion
You know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if it's informal I'd probably choose something, I mean, just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill *#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because that's a lot of fun, especially this time of year where it's so nice out. *#Other
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Um, if it was formal I'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not I'm not into formal dinner parties,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'd probably go with lasagna, a green salad, and garlic bread.#Other
So what do you use for cookbooks?#Wh-Question
Um, I have a PILLSBURY cookbook I got when I was married,#Statement-non-opinion
but, it's kind of the bible of cooking#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for me.#Other
Then I have some from like church that are more family recipes that are more useful#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, budget cookbooks,#Other
but#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, of course, you get a lot from when you're growing up.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I cook a lot the same as, as my mom did,#Statement-non-opinion
of course I've added several#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
different recipes,#Other
but, what you serve or what would you#Wh-Question
Well, I, I, I think we come from, from different backgrounds, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
so the,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's good#Appreciation
I, I, I,#Uninterpretable
so, it diff-, you know,#Uninterpretable
have different perspectives that you are.#Statement-opinion
I find the JOY OF COOKING to be a remarkably useful book#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to, to fall back on,#Other
because it has almost everything in it.#Statement-non-opinion
But on the other hand, it's not very inspiring, uh,#Statement-opinion
it's a good reference when you need to dig something up.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What we've found very useful is a book called THE THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK,#Statement-non-opinion
I think that's the title, by Marion Burroughs#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes, you know, the whole meal#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so she's#Uninterpretable
that would be wonderful in these times#Appreciation
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now, now, I, I find that the cutting up of the food, and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
either they're really fast or *#Statement-opinion
But they're, but they're, but they're interesting#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
they're interesting menus, um, combinations that you wouldn't have, nobody thought of.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um.#Uninterpretable
What's one of your favorites?#Wh-Question
Um, gee,#Hold before answer/agreement
the one I had most recently was, was one that, was, ha-,#Statement-non-opinion
she, she describes as Jim Beard's favorite, um, summer menu, or something,#Statement-non-opinion
and it consisted of, of grilled kielbasa sausage#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, a potato salad with olive oil, and uh, some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there.#Other
Wow,#Appreciation
sounds too good.#Appreciation
Uh, and that, and that was, you know, that's, that, that's certain you can do in thirty minutes.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But there are a whole lot of, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I, I would recommend you look at that book#Action-directive
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK.#Agree/Accept
if you're a busy person.#Other
THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK.#Statement-non-opinion
That sounds fun.#Appreciation
I find a lot of the cookbooks that, I don't know, that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients, or things I don't keep on hand all the time#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I have young children,#Statement-non-opinion
and our budget's set, you know, at this time,#Statement-non-opinion
but I want to use simple recipes that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have things on hand,#Other
I don't have to run to the store to buy or look for something I haven't heard of#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes.#Agree/Accept
That's why sometimes I shy away from, uh, more of a traditional cookbook#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, well, it was interesting talking to you.#Statement-opinion
It's a fun subject.#Statement-opinion
Food is one of my favorite things too.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Anything else you wanted to add?#Open-Question
Well, you had said dinner, you know, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
what would I put together for a formal dinner.#Quotation
We, we had some friends over as recently as Saturday night#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
and, and, um, put, here, here#Uninterpretable
the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert, you know, a chocolate mousse recipe#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's good.#Appreciation
and a sort of cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, which is this wonderful thing you can do, um,#Other
basically you're baking, baking chicken in a, in an open pan, um, having marinated it first#Statement-non-opinion
and, my wife did this part so I don't remember all the details#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
marinated in olive oil and some seasoning, um, and cooked with some olives and some, and some prunes, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
there's a little bit of brown sugar in there,#Statement-non-opinion
and it bakes up#Statement-non-opinion
and it's a delicious thing,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's easy#Statement-non-opinion
That sounds good.#Appreciation
comparatively.#Statement-non-opinion
So. *#Uninterpretable
That sounds really good.#Appreciation
Um. I'm sorry,#Other
I just love#Statement-non-opinion
It sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than I am,#Statement-opinion
I'm pretty simple right now,#Statement-non-opinion
but.#Uninterpretable
Well, maybe a little more leisure time#Statement-opinion
Yes#Agree/Accept
to do it.#Other
I don't know,#Hedge
that's probably, that's true,#Agree/Accept
I have little ones#Statement-non-opinion
and we, and they won't eat, you know, too many different foods#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right now.#Other
I found my kids were very frustrating when they were little#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
in terms of their tastes.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, there again, sometimes it was easy,#Statement-non-opinion
they'd, you know,#Uninterpretable
canned ravioli was,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
one of their favorites, and so it was easy to#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
open a can of ravioli.#Other
Spaghetti's a pretty staple every other week or so#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it goes a long ways too.#Statement-non-opinion
So. *#Uninterpretable
Well, nice talking to you Cheryl.#Conventional-closing
All righty.#Other
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Talk to you later maybe.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing

Well, Sid,#Statement-non-opinion
have you established what kind of requirements you are looking for, for your next vehicle?#Yes-No-Question
Well, I don't know if I really have a, a lot of, uh, requirements.#Other answers
Uh, I guess I look at, uh, getting the best deal.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Uh, that's my main objectives normally. Whoever is willing to deal and, and give me a good price.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Well, I, I tend to be more methodical I guess.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I determine first of all what I'm going to use the vehicle for, whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a, a personal mover. Uh, where it's going to be driven, you know, what types of, uh, driving I'm going to be doing on it, primarily highway or, or local mileage more often.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that I tend to drive cars for about ten years and a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I'm, I'm real picky.#Statement-opinion
I-, if you are going to keep something that long, you know, you better get something that you wanted to begin with and that you are going to like for a long time.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know I've had pretty good luck, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
even if, if you take any car and, and you care for it well enough, uh, you are going to get some good life out of it.#Statement-opinion
Uh, my, my Oldsmobile right now that I have, uh, is getting near eighty thousand#Statement-non-opinion
and it's still in pretty good shape.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, there was a flaw in there where a, where a head gasket bolt broke,#Statement-non-opinion
and it cost me some bucks to, to fix that#Statement-non-opinion
but that was, you know, something that was unforeseen.#Statement-opinion
But I still think I c-, I'm going to get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it.#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways also then.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, I, I drive like the song says, THE LITTLE OLD LADY but, uh, but not FROM PASADENA#Hold before answer/agreement
.#Non-verbal
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Yes answers
I, I baby them as much as I possibly can.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, it's a pretty big expense nowadays.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and I guess I like to take care of it, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't have to buy one too often.#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Statement-opinion
Uh, do you have more than, than one vehicle in your fleet?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, do you have a family fleet#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Yes answers
I, I, I got an old, uh, seventy-six, uh, Grand Fury that, uh, doesn't want to die on me#Statement-non-opinion
so I, I just keep running the thing. Don't want to sell it or get rid of it until it quits,#Statement-non-opinion
but it just doesn't seem to want to.#Statement-opinion
I'll probably have, uh, three, four hundred thousand before it wants to die.#Statement-opinion
Well, that may be.#Agree/Accept
They, Chrysler made some really good old engines back then#Statement-opinion
like the, the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine.#Statement-opinion
Oh. I've got the big three sixty in there, gas guzzler#Statement-non-opinion
but it runs good.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
At the moment I've got, uh, Cadillac Cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a, uh, reasonably new Plymouth Voyager.#Statement-non-opinion
It's only a, a couple of years old.#Statement-non-opinion
But that's the second one of, of those that we've had,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's the, the family travel vehicle.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, not only does it do all the, the, uh, carpooling around during the week,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that what I'm getting ready to get next is probably a Suburban unless they drastically change the, the vehicle a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I'm just getting tired of when I do get hung up in traffic, not being able to determine what the problem is and, and come to some resolution of whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit and that kind of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just because I can't see, you know,#Other
I'm to, my Cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that I can't see past any vehicle#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's in front of me.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I'm considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I just have so many hauling projects a lot of times#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I, I'd like to just start doing some, uh, carpentry, uh, type work around.#Statement-non-opinion
I just feel that,#Statement-opinion

Hi.#Conventional-opening
So, uh, what was the last car repair you had?#Wh-Question
Just recently I was kind of laughing when I, when I heard the switchboard talking about the question because, uh, I had to have my, uh, radiator flushed#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
and it was getting rusty.#Statement-non-opinion
And the thing that they forgot to do was to, um, to also look at the hose,#Statement-non-opinion
and I had gone about oh, two days with my new radiator flushed#Statement-non-opinion
and the hose burst.#Statement-non-opinion
So I was stranded out on the highway#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
Did you crack the block or what?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I, I didn't do that thank goodness,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there, you know, left to do that#Statement-non-opinion
but it cost me all kind of money, you know, to have that repaired after they said they were going to, they had repaired it.#Statement-non-opinion
So that was, that was a horrible experience#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Response Acknowledgement
I see.#Response Acknowledgement
just recently.#Other
You got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes.#Agree/Accept
That can be pretty serious.#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
I know.#Agree/Accept
What about you?#Open-Question
Oh, I guess it's been awhile for me.#Statement-non-opinion
I'd sa-,#Uninterpretable
it's been about a year.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I had the, uh, the water pump break on my car.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was traveling, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I was going on my way home from Thanksgiving#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it broke like in the middle of nowhere.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I had to get it towed and then fixed#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
big pain.#Statement-opinion
Oh, oh, I know. I know.#Agree/Accept
Especially when you're out on the highway.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's where I was.#Statement-non-opinion
Luckily someone came by and gave me a ride.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know, well, you know, uh, living in Dallas,#Statement-non-opinion
you know we've got, uh, bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic#Statement-opinion
and, uh, that was, that was horrible.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know to have the, you know,#Uninterpretable
your car is fuming#Statement-non-opinion
and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
It's already a hundred degrees#Statement-non-opinion
you don't need that too.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Oh, shoot#Appreciation
But my car is getting old.#Statement-non-opinion
See it's about six years old now,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so is mine#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I got it right out of college#Statement-non-opinion
and so it's, uh, it's starting to show the wear and tear now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm hoping mine gets me through.#Statement-non-opinion
I got until May until I'm out.#Statement-non-opinion
So when I cross that one I'll be okay.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, uh, that was my graduation present to myself,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Oh, that's nice#Appreciation
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I know#Agree/Accept
so but gosh, it's really starting to, to wear#Statement-non-opinion
so I've been thinking, especially now is a good time to buy a car.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Go-,#Uninterpretable
because I can't, uh, I don't know if I want to, you know, pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I don't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is#Statement-non-opinion
and it's not worth it#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
I agree with you there.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I don't know, uh,#Hedge
because I, I need to have it tuned, you know, tuned up and I don't know, replace some of the belts.#Statement-non-opinion
And I was looking at the, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
tires need to be replaced#Statement-non-opinion
and so I was thinking just a lot of money#Statement-non-opinion
I'm,#Uninterpretable
might as well buy me a new car for that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I got new tires last winter too#Statement-non-opinion
so I'm like, well, that's the last major purchase for this thing.#Statement-non-opinion
It's not worth it.#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Well, you have to, in Pennsylvania, boy,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
you have to really have your car winterized and stuff, huh?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Yes answers
we get some killer winters up here in the mountains.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
So,#Uninterpretable
Lot of snow and a lot of cold.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, especially don't you have what, a lot of salt on the ground?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
at times there's a lot of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, rust and the, and the body too, huh?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I haven't had a big problem with that though.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I've been pretty lucky there.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I think they get the new Z-bart stuff and everything to where you can, um,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's usually pretty good.#Appreciation
You just rinse it off after the winter is over and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
done with it.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and go like that so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I usually like to do most repairs on my own though.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
just because that way I know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Plus if something goes wrong, I know who to blame.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
Well, I, I think I'm getting too old for all that.#Statement-non-opinion
My, uh, I had four brothers#Statement-non-opinion
and they used to drag me out underneath the car, and stuff#Statement-non-opinion
so I can, I can do all that stuff#Statement-non-opinion
but I, I think I'd much prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to, to go have it done now#Statement-non-opinion
so I can get my hands dirty.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm just getting, getting to that age I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
You just don't have,#Uninterpretable
your time becomes very precious#Statement-non-opinion
so working on the car is just not one of those things I want to spend my time on anymore#Statement-non-opinion
More fun things to do.#Summarize/reformulate
Absolutely, absolutely.#Agree/Accept
So,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
yeah,#Other
I'm trying to, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I just need one,#Statement-non-opinion
I had two cars there for a while#Statement-non-opinion
so I wouldn't have to worry about which car was going to run.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's nice.#Appreciation
And yeah,#Agree/Accept
so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And yeah,#Repeat-phrase
so that,#Uninterpretable
One is bad enough#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
one was bad enough.#Agree/Accept
But I think I got rid of the wrong one#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I soon, I need a lot of repairs done on, on this one#Statement-non-opinion
so yeah,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
that was, uh, that was something else#Statement-non-opinion
Well, are our five minutes up?#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
I was just wondering that#Conventional-closing
I, I didn't, I didn't set the time or anything to, uh,#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
I didn't either.#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
put ,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
this must be a, a hard category.#Conventional-closing
Well, yeah,#Conventional-closing
I guess. Um, you know,#Conventional-closing
unless you're, um, you know, big do-it-yourselfer. Um, to, you know, fix up your own cars and, and things like that.#Conventional-closing
So, but I guess they were talking about experiences.#Conventional-closing
You know, I, uh, uh, I did,#Uninterpretable
my parents live in Ohio#Conventional-closing
so I, I do know something about the, you know, the really cold weather.#Conventional-closing
And, uh, I've always lived down here in the south,#Conventional-closing
and, oh, I took my car up there to their house#Conventional-closing
and, um, I guess I had a crack in the block,#Conventional-closing
and when I got up there the car,#Conventional-closing

Okay,#Other

Our lives are, are built around foods that we like and, an-, nutritionally good for us.#Statement-opinion
Yes, sir.#Appreciation
What kind of dining out do you like?#Wh-Question
Well, there is two kinds.#Statement-non-opinion
One I guess I'd say is with my wife where we enjoy, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
oh, I guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant.#Other
Uh, you know, something nice.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the other is with my whole family whom we, uh, go somewhere that the kids will enjoy#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, recently we have been hitting Pancho's up.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a local Mexican restaurant.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

We have one called Chi Chi's in th-, in our area.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, we had a restaurant called La Bamba#Statement-non-opinion

Oh, we, we do too.#Statement-non-opinion
We, uh, we enjoy Mexican food.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I'm just not impressed with the quality of it.#Statement-non-opinion
It's just primarily the price that's, uh, satisfying at this point.#Statement-non-opinion
But the kids,#Statement-opinion
Is that right?#Yes-No-Question
seem to enjoy it.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and, uh, let's see.#Hold before answer/agreement
We've, uh, just recently discovered a super restaurant down here#Statement-non-opinion
but it's, uh, not part of a chain#Statement-non-opinion
it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant.#Statement-non-opinion
But the first one we've been to that, uh, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had#Statement-non-opinion
that was, uh, not just really super.#Statement-non-opinion
It's nice to find a place like that.#Statement-opinion
Oh, boy that is wonderful.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I, I agree with you on that.#Agree/Accept
And I wa-, was really a seafood addict myself.#Statement-non-opinion

Is that right?#Backchannel in question form
Did you have any dealings with the, uh, underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando, Florida?#Yes-No-Question
I have dealt with nearly all of the, all of the research laboratories that the country has.#Other answers
Yes, sir.#Appreciation
My dad worked there for years, and years.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's wh-, that's, uh, that's where I grew up was down in Orlando.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Oh, you grew up in Orlando.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Uninterpretable
That's, uh, that's interesting, Well, I was in submarines. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's what I worked on.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Uninterpretable
must have had some interesting, uh, assignments for you there.#Statement-opinion
Wh-, when did you retire?#Wh-Question
The end of last month.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, great.#Appreciation
I'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
I certainly have#Affirmative non-yes answers
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, wa-, I hate to, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I wish I could talk to you about that, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I guess we should continue on, uh,#Statement-opinion
Okay.#Agree/Accept
Okay.#Repeat-phrase
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Where's,#Wh-Question
How do you like Chinese food?#Wh-Question
Oh, we, we do enjoy that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes, sir.#Uninterpretable
Uh, I don't know if we are particularly adventurous,#Statement-opinion
we find something we like, uh, like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good, uh, at a particular restaurant#Statement-non-opinion
and then we usually stick by it.#Statement-non-opinion
But do you,#Open-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What about you?#Other
Well, I, uh, enjoy the Szechuan type of, uh, Chinese food.#Statement-non-opinion
Hot?#Signal-non-understanding
Yes.#Yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yep, uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
I, I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself.#Statement-non-opinion
I have in the past.#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't done recently,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals.#Statement-opinion
Um. Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking?#Wh-Question
Uh, just at home.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I enjoyed the food#Statement-non-opinion
and I bought a lot of, uh, good cookbooks,#Statement-non-opinion
and I've been following through on that.#Statement-non-opinion
When you find the right cookbook, why it works out.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food?#Wh-Question
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, that one's a good question.#Hold before answer/agreement
Here it's right under my nose if I can find it#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, boy.#Appreciation
I guess one of the things we've, uh, started avoiding is the, uh, run of the mill chop suey and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But we enjoy trying, uh, different kinds of chicken or, uh, sh-, you know, even, uh, shrimp, uh, dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant.#Statement-non-opinion
One of th-, th-, this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, it's a paperback#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it's by someone named Chang.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
Isabelle Chang.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
thanks for that, uh, reference.#Thanking
Yeah,#Downplayer
yeah.#Downplayer
I think you will enjoy that.#Statement-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
good.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
Well, it certainly is nice talking with you Gene.#Conventional-closing
And, uh, what is your phone at home?#Wh-Question

Uh, I basically, uh, listen to the news from the T V.#Statement-non-opinion
That's probably the only time I get a chance to, uh, uh, take a look at it is the evening news#Statement-non-opinion
and, and then if I'm lucky, I might be able to hear something through news wise.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, other than that that's probably how I get my source unless something really tragic happens and somebody tells me it about through, uh, uh, you know, uh, through conversation or whatever#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, most of the time it is through the news in the evening#Statement-non-opinion
so that's about the,#Uninterpretable
You don't get any newspapers?#Yes-No-Question
Newspapers?#Signal-non-understanding
No,#No answers
I'm not too much in reading newspapers.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, not that I don't enjoy newspapers or anything like that#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, part of it is because I just don't feel like I need, the need to have them, uh, with watching the T V or whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
We get our weekly news around the area#Statement-non-opinion
and I might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest, uh, in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state#Statement-non-opinion
But the majority of the time now I don't get a daily newspaper where, you know, I get tons of, uh, news coming in that kind of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm kind of the opposite of you.#Statement-non-opinion
I get all my news from newspapers.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you do ?#Yes-No-Question
We have, we have two newspapers.#Statement-non-opinion
You read it in the morning then?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Two newspapers in the morning.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm, uh, in, in a government position that I'm in the news a lot#Other
so, uh, I, I kind of look through to see, see what, uh, I'm quoted in.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, sure#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, how, how bad the quotes are every day.#Statement-non-opinion
To see if they did it or if they, uh, criticize you or#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
put something in there wrong.#Other
Sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or, uh, sometimes there's, uh, letter to the editor about me#Statement-non-opinion
or there's a, even, uh, editorials#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for and against what I'm doing#Other
Sure,#Agree/Accept
exactly#Agree/Accept
But, uh, but T V, uh, the T V, I, I don't really watch, even if I'm, even if I'm on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But just,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's, that's kind of like you said then.#Statement-non-opinion
We, we are kind of on the opposite where I get home and, uh, while I'm cooking supper the T V is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, very seldom do I catch the ten o'clock#Statement-non-opinion
so, by that time, you know, old news is probably what I hear through the grapevine or whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then I think everybody was glued to the T V to find out what was going on.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, other than that, no.#Statement-non-opinion
It's,#Uninterpretable
And that's,#Uninterpretable
C N N had the, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
everybody was watching C N N,#Statement-non-opinion
that seemed to be the place to be#Statement-opinion
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
exactly,#Agree/Accept
exactly,#Agree/Accept
sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to find out what was going on on that.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
At that point, I was watching the T V.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
On something like that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well it brought kind of, uh, more of a vivid, uh, look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
You know you know a lot of people that read the news to, newspapers to get the news of what's going on#Statement-opinion
and, uh, other people that, you know, do it differently or don't even watch any news at all#Statement-opinion
so. But,#Uninterpretable
Well, the thing is, with, with T V, I, I, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
a lot of times the, the news on, uh, the local T V is so brief, you really don't get the full picture of what, uh, what's going on.#Statement-opinion
Exactly happens.#Collaborative Completion
Sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's,#Uninterpretable
And, uh, that's, that's a problem that I have is not, getting just a little brief, uh, idea of what's happening.#Statement-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
Oh sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a clip, you know, a sentence or two#Statement-non-opinion
and that's about it of what went on#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But#Statement-non-opinion
Makes sense.#Statement-non-opinion
I like the weather report.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I wa-,#Uninterpretable
I alway, always, I always turn that on#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's one part I watch because of, uh, I go surfing down here#Statement-non-opinion
and I always#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good.#Other
So you're right on the coast line.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
You're not, uh, further up.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
You're,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Yes answers
No.#No answers
Right on the south Florida coast.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Where the weather is still warm here.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I suppose you watch for huri-, hurricanes coming in and#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
things like that.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Weather channel's good#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Yes answers
that's about the only time in the, in the summer, uh, if you're watching T V for the weather, even though it's very hard to predict what's going on,#Statement-opinion
they'll kind of say, well, there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
This is the, what is expected,#Statement-non-opinion
but a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically, uh, so fast#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
I mostly look for the storms out in the ocean.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, hundreds of miles out#Other
so I can predict my, my week and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where I'm going to be.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I can be at the, at the beach when the waves start coming in.#Statement-non-opinion
to take off.#Collaborative Completion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
That's,#Uninterpretable
sounds pretty good#Statement-opinion
so. Anyway, I don't know if our time is getting up here#Statement-non-opinion
or it's got to be fairly close to that#Statement-opinion

Okay, Eric.#Other
Uh, are you married#Yes-No-Question
and do you have a family?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, yes I am to, uh, both questions.#Yes answers
Okay#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances.#Yes-No-Question
Uh, yeah#Yes answers
we do.#Statement-non-opinion
We, uh, uh,#Uninterpretable
basically there's the, you know, the expenses that are fixed during the month#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know the ones that come every, every month#Other
and we, uh, enter those into, uh, into a spread sheet#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, whatever is left, uh, after that we,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know, we sit down and agree on kind of what, what sort of range we are going to#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
generally going to shoot for.#Other
I see. Uh#Response Acknowledgement
So what do you do?#Open-Question
Well, that's basically what we do.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, about every, every three months or so, we re-evaluate our budget#Statement-non-opinion
and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks.#Statement-non-opinion
I work part time at night#Statement-non-opinion
Wow#Appreciation
and he works, and my husband works full times days#Statement-non-opinion
and so we have four checks,#Statement-non-opinion
but that works out nice because we get paid every week#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that does help,#Other
.#Non-verbal
that helps a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
And then, uh, we don't have a lot ex-, extra for extra spending,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
so it's pretty well ear marked.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
All allocated out.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Every penny is ear marked#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh it, we have found that works the best#Statement-non-opinion
and and so if we can just divide them up, all the major bills up.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, we found it easier to divide the major bills up, you know, cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half,#Statement-non-opinion
but and divide those up between all,#Statement-non-opinion
uh-huh.#Uninterpretable
All the checks,#Summarize/reformulate
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so we are not taking a huge sum out, out of one#Statement-non-opinion
and then the next pay check we're real short#Statement-non-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
we found that, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
it's definitely helped, uh, get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses.#Other
That's true.#Agree/Accept
We were, before we started doing that kind of a thing, we were, uh, spending, uh, money for things that, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
we kind of tended to eat out a bit more#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than we should have,#Other
.#Non-verbal
and it was easy to, uh, let things get out of hand.#Statement-non-opinion
We thought it uh, thought it to be really helpful.#Statement-non-opinion
We have gotten some of our loans paid off really#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because of this and stuff like that#Other
so,#Uninterpretable
Well, it helps you to focus where your money goes#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and and I am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget,#Statement-opinion
but you're wondering my, when you put down all the money that you do bring in#Statement-opinion
and then you're saying, my word where did all that money#Statement-opinion
That's a lot of money,#Summarize/reformulate
but#Uninterpretable
go.#Other
Where does it go?#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh#Uninterpretable
But,#Uninterpretable
and also we have found that if we write down,#Statement-non-opinion
and we did this.#Statement-non-opinion
We are not real consistent with this,#Statement-non-opinion
but we did it for about a month#Statement-non-opinion
and we wrote down everything that we bought when, you know, every pay check#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so we could see where every penny went#Statement-non-opinion
and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend#Statement-non-opinion
and like I say we haven't been real consistent with it.#Statement-non-opinion
It's,#Uninterpretable
we should cause it does help.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
the other, the other thing that that we've found that helps is, you know, we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's just to, uh, uh, get up the money in advance and put it in, uh, uh, so long as it wasn't you know, unreasonably high, but for things like food expenses#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or whatever. Just put it in uh#Other
.#Non-verbal
in an envelope or whatever#Other
and that way it kind of forced us to, uh, stick to that amount. * Should end with a slash. This is an independent clause, as is B's next turn.#Statement-non-opinion
Wel-, just stick to that,#Summarize/reformulate
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That is,#Uninterpretable
And then once that was gone, well * should be start of a new slash unitsee B.58 utt2#Other
.#Non-verbal
if the entertainment amount was gone#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That#Statement-opinion
for the month say, oh, it's gone#Other
that sounds like a really good idea.#Other
So.#Uninterpretable
And it really helpful.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet?#Yes-No-Question
We, we haven't.#Negative non-no answers
We our our initial goal was just to retire debt, uh, completely retire debt for car payments and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Response Acknowledgement
credit card#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, credit card debt and all of that.#Other
We are just at a point where, where we could start thinking about it#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Oh that's good.#Appreciation
That's a good feeling#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I#Uninterpretable
My husband just graduated from the university, uh, a year ago#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so finally#Statement-non-opinion
A student.#Summarize/reformulate
finally we are getting to that point too.#Other
So, are you still going to school#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Yes answers
I am actually in the, in the mas-,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay,#Other
I'm back on.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, you say you watch evenings mostly?#Yes-No-Question
I watch evenings because I work all day.#Statement-non-opinion
I used to watch daytimes.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, mainly like ALL MY CHILDREN, that kind of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, so ...#Uninterpretable
And then sometimes OPRAH and sometimes DONAHUE,#Statement-non-opinion
but now it's mainly evenings.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Which ones?#Wh-Question
I tape THIRTY SOMETHING,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and L A LAW.#Other
Those are the two I like the best.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, two they're going to change.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, one they're taking,#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Statement-non-opinion
It's going to be history, I know.#Statement-non-opinion
off.#Other
I don't know what's going to ha-,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
we like L A LAW.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We don't watch THIRTY SOMETHING,#Statement-non-opinion
but that's kind of young for us.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband and I are grandparents.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well. Well ...#Uninterpretable
So we don't watch, uh, that type of show,#Statement-non-opinion
but we like L A LAW.#Statement-non-opinion
We like,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that.#Other
We're just,#Uninterpretable
I'm sorry they're breaking the team up, because we liked all the ones that were on there.#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
I'm amazed.#Statement-opinion
I'm not sure I like the new ones too much.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm surprised that, I was surprised at the ending of, you know, with all the funny things happening and different things.#Statement-non-opinion
I just wonder if, if, uh, they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show, since it's gone on for so long,#Statement-opinion
it looks like,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show.#Other
I know.#Agree/Accept
Of course, I guess that's not bad.#Statement-opinion
Alan Alda did it on MASH.#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
Isn't that funny?#Yes-No-Question
It hasn't hurt him at all.#Statement-opinion
So do you, do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, I don't usually like stuff that continues.#Negative non-no answers
That's why I'm surprised I like those two shows, because usually I like, you know, stuff that just ends sort of, that you just, you don't have to,#Statement-non-opinion
In one hour, like QUANTUM LEAP.#Collaborative Completion
have watched, you know.#Other
.#Non-verbal
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I mean, you don't have to ...#Uninterpretable
That's one of our favorites#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
which they do at the beginning of the season,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, I usually don't like that.#Other
to grab your attention.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Other
that's always a bummer too.#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
Sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We, we do that sometimes.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I guess I'm, I'm not into real heavy stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
L A LAW is about the heaviest thing I watch.#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'll, mostly I'm into it for relaxation,#Other
so I like things like GOLDEN GIRLS or CHEERS#Statement-non-opinion
or, uh, Monday night is real good with me, you know, MAJOR DAD and, and, uh, NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, and, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
oh, what's that one with Burt Reynolds?#Yes-No-Question
That type of show is what we#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what, uh, we watch.#Other
We generally just stay on one channel all, for all of Monday night, just to watch those.#Statement-non-opinion
Just some of the times they're continued,#Statement-non-opinion
but mostly they're just little vignettes.#Statement-non-opinion
A new one we found we really like is that DINOSAURS.#Statement-non-opinion
Have you seen that?#Yes-No-Question
Huh-uh.#No answers
That is, it's, it's really funny.#Statement-opinion
They use like animated,#Statement-non-opinion
it's not like a cartoon,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's like dummies and things,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that are used,#Other
and, uh, it's really, um,#Uninterpretable
and robots probably.#Statement-non-opinion
But there's always a, a moral to each story.#Statement-non-opinion
And what night is it on?#Wh-Question
Well, yo-, we watched it,#Hold before answer/agreement
the times we've seen it, it's been like on Satur-, or, excuse me, Friday night.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, but it's,#Uninterpretable
we've only seen it a couple of times.#Hedge
But it, it's real,#Statement-opinion
the first one we saw, um, they were, it, it involved a tradition of when a per-, person reaches seventy-five,#Statement-non-opinion
and I can't remember what day they call it,#Statement-non-opinion
but, but, uh, the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, great.#Appreciation
Anyway#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Anyway, it, it goes on, you know,#Other
and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all,#Statement-non-opinion
and then when it comes time for him to throw her over, well, the, the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And she said no,#Statement-non-opinion
you can't do, you know,#Quotation
he ran her out, was running to hi-, in a wheelchair to hide her,#Statement-non-opinion
and she said, "You can't do that."#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
"This is tradition.#Quotation
This is what old people are supposed to be, thrown over the, the cliff."#Quotation
And, uh, he said, "I don't understand."#Statement-non-opinion
It's, it's real funny that they give the teenagers the, as the one that questions, uh, the, what's going on.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, in the end of, uh, the son-in-law, when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff, uh, th-, the so-, the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says, "No, you can't do it," and then, and then, uh, "Oh, well, we've got to do it. It's tradition,"#Statement-non-opinion
and the son was, you know, "Why?"#Statement-non-opinion
And so,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in, in the end he doesn't throw her over,#Other
Oh, he doesn't.#Summarize/reformulate
and, of course, the town thinks he's just terrible, because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it.#Statement-non-opinion
And then we saw one where this, there was a teenage, when a teenage boy comes into his manhood,#Statement-non-opinion
they call it the night of the howling,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or something like that,#Other
and they all go out and howl, you know#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And, and the son refused to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
He, he did,#Statement-non-opinion
he thought it was not ...#Statement-non-opinion
So he didn't go howl?#Signal-non-understanding

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth,#Other
and I guess maybe there are some parts of that,#Statement-opinion

But what I've read about it, they talk about that.#Statement-non-opinion
But anyway, we've, we've enjoyed that,#Statement-non-opinion

and I mean, it, it got to the point he was eating a pear here,#Statement-non-opinion
and he bit into it,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was just hanging by a thread.#Statement-non-opinion
And I, and I'd tell him, you know, it's getting ready to fall out,#Statement-non-opinion
and he walked around the house with his fa-, face down toward the floor and his mouth open, hoping it would fall out, because he wouldn't let anybody pull it.#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

hear them and can't see them#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are sending the message, you know, that the, the, the puppies are missing#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it shows the town,#Statement-non-opinion
and you can hear all the barking,#Statement-non-opinion

uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
can't see the dogs#Other
kind of dark,#Statement-non-opinion

That is their very favorite.#Statement-non-opinion

but we did try to go see about a month ago that, um, DEAD AGAIN#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that black and white one,#Other

In fact we kept sitting there all through the theater going now what, what did that mean,#Statement-non-opinion
wait, wait run that back,#Quotation
and we couldn't run it back#Statement-non-opinion
Wasn't that good.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
uh-huh.#Yes answers
But we, we just kept trying to figure it out until finally toward the end,#Statement-non-opinion
and we thought we were being very quiet,#Statement-non-opinion
this man turned around and said, Could you all please save that for later.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'm sorry#Apology
Oh, no.#Downplayer
We're just not real big movie goers.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I like to watch the movies,#Statement-non-opinion

it's a funny movie.#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he wanted to see that.#Statement-non-opinion
I thought the funny part in HOME ALONE was, uh, that's good for kids, is kind of coming up with how they can deal with problems on their own without panicking#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
and I thought they could learn a lot of lessons from that.#Statement-opinion
The little guy is so cute,#Statement-non-opinion
and he's terribly rich by now.#Statement-non-opinion
I hope he stays cute#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept

what I try to do when they come out is just make a list of them that look good#Statement-non-opinion

they had HOME ALONE offered for like,#Statement-non-opinion
I think with the rebate you could get it for nine dollars#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's pretty good,#Appreciation
and I thought well, now that's, that's close enough to being several, you know,#Statement-opinion
you could rent it#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
more than onc-,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
more than four times and watch that.#Other
That, that makes it worth it, uh,#Statement-opinion
but, a lot of the Disney movies, it's just too expensive,#Statement-opinion
and I can rent them#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I under-, I understand#Agree/Accept
or I can make a copy#Statement-non-opinion
I understand,#Other

Well, it's hard, it's hard to find a movie any more these days that you can take your kids#Statement-opinion

and even the ones that we rent at home, the trouble with some of them I know,#Statement-non-opinion
we rented ADVENTURES IN BABY-SITTING#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I know.#Appreciation
thinking that would be so cute,#Other
and it's a precious movie,#Statement-non-opinion
but the language in it is just for no reason, has to stick in,#Statement-non-opinion
Now, see, I remember thinking it's a wonderful movie,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's been so long since I#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
watched it,#Other
I don't remember the language.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you watch,#Statement-opinion
Was it bad?#Yes-No-Question
it differently when your kids are in the room, you know#Other
Well, that's true.#Agree/Accept
and I was just sitting there going, Oh, my goodness,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm going to have to stop and explain,#Statement-non-opinion
and they go, I know, Mommy, I know.#Statement-non-opinion

you're right,#Agree/Accept
I watched it without them.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

it's, it's a little different, because you see things from a different#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
different angle.#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, we rented,#Statement-non-opinion
this summer before we went on vacation,#Statement-non-opinion
we rented Chevy Chase and that FAMILY VACATION.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And those are just absolutely hilarious#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but you just really can't watch a lot of that.#Statement-non-opinion
We had to fast forward through a whole lot of it for them to see it#Statement-non-opinion
Yes#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Some of it just isn't,#Statement-opinion

Okay,#Other
do you have any pets?#Yes-No-Question

I have three cats and a dog.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, boy.#Appreciation
Sound like us,#Statement-non-opinion
we have,#Uninterpretable
Um,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
go ahead.#Action-directive
Um, we just got the, the dog less than a year ago#Statement-non-opinion
so, he's still a puppy.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, what kind is it?#Wh-Question
He's a mixed breed,#Statement-non-opinion
he's part Collie, part Shepherd, and part Chow.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, so you ,#Uninterpretable
More Collie and Shepherd than Chow,#Other
the only Chow he's got is, is his tongue.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, he's got a blue tongue?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
He's got little spots on them.#Statement-non-opinion
We have two Chows and, a miniature Schnauzer, and recently added, a guinea pig, which wasn't by my choice,#Statement-non-opinion
but I was out ruled,#Statement-non-opinion
so, but the dogs are mainly mine and my husb-,#Statement-non-opinion
but I just love them to death.#Statement-non-opinion
Was the guinea pig for your,#Yes-No-Question
Daughter,#Collaborative Completion
yes.#Yes answers
for your child?#Other
Yes,#Yes answers
as if the dogs weren't enough, had to have, a guinea pig,#Statement-non-opinion
so, anyway she's, she enjoys her though,#Statement-non-opinion
so that's, that's what matters.#Statement-non-opinion
But, um, our Chows, we've had them, I'd say, right around six maybe seven years#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Really?#Backchannel in question form
they're, um, registered#Statement-non-opinion
and we've been breeding them.#Statement-non-opinion
She's had about four or five litters.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my, my husband's always wanted a Chow#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm kind of concerned about, um, with having cats,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and how, how they socialize with cats. Um, which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, because we thought they would socialize easier,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, my husband had originally wanted an#Statement-non-opinion
and his brother has an#Statement-non-opinion
and he, so far he's bitten ten people.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, man.#Appreciation
So,#Uninterpretable
Goodness.#Appreciation
And the people that he got the from, used to have cats#Statement-non-opinion
and they no longer have any other cats.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So,#Uninterpretable
It's telling, um, you know#Uninterpretable
when we had, um, we had a cat when we first married, no, took ,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
we had the cat first,#Statement-non-opinion
and then we got, uh, the Chow.#Statement-non-opinion
And, bring, um, bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, you would think, you know, that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and, and paw at their face#Statement-non-opinion
and they'd just play#Statement-non-opinion
and they were never, they never harmed her.#Statement-non-opinion
So, uh, they got along great,#Statement-non-opinion
now I don't know how, how it would be bringing in, uh, like cat to a full, full grown dog.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I wouldn't want to bring a cat into a full grown dog,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I, I wouldn't feel, um, hesitant about bringing a puppy in,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to adult cats,#Other
I think they would socialize easier.#Statement-opinion
I think, so, too.#Agree/Accept
Um, how, how old is your child?#Wh-Question
Five#Statement-non-opinion
Five?#Backchannel in question form
She's a real .#Uninterpretable
So, you had the dogs before you had the baby?#Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
And I was, not really concerned about, um, them harming her, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I think, I think a lot of that, that, that we hear all the time is how you bring them up.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And ours are real friendly,#Statement-non-opinion
they're protective,#Statement-non-opinion
but they're very friendly, and lovable,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you think they're lapdogs. You know,#Statement-non-opinion
they'll just come jump on your lap and want to be, have their bellies rubbed and everything#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
What color are they?#Wh-Question
Uh, the female's red#Statement-non-opinion
and the male is black.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I bet the black one's pretty.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
he is, he's a big old thing.#Statement-non-opinion
And, um, I was concerned about the female mainly,#Statement-non-opinion
and as luck had it, uh, she had puppies the same week my daughter was born,#Statement-non-opinion
so, it was kind of like, she had her babies and understood about, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
About your baby.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
yeah,#Yes answers
and that,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Yes answers
I think that really helped and, um, my daughter, you know, since, since she's little has been playing with them#Statement-non-opinion
and they let her tug their hair and, and get on their back or whatever#Statement-non-opinion
and she's, she's grown up with them and loves them to death#Statement-non-opinion
and they love her,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it's good for kids to grow up around pets,#Statement-opinion
I do, too.#Agree/Accept
as, as long as they don't have any allergies to them or anything.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I think it really helps them to understand when, when they go to other people's houses#Statement-opinion
and they have pets,#Statement-opinion
I see so many times kids just, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
they, mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah, exactly,#Agree/Accept
that or, or, uh, the other extreme,#Statement-opinion
they're, they're terrified of them#Statement-opinion
and I hate that,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
and they shouldn't be,#Statement-opinion
I mean, some maybe#Uninterpretable
but, but, um, like our miniature Schnauzer, she's just, she's just like, um, a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly,#Statement-non-opinion
and a lot of kids are scared of that. And which I understand because she is, you know, a lot of movement and everything#Statement-non-opinion
but when she calms down they're so scared of her#Statement-non-opinion
it's,#Uninterpretable
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing,#Statement-non-opinion
she wouldn't hi-, you know, harm them at all#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, and that's mainly people that have never had pets around their children,#Statement-non-opinion
so, I think, I think it's a good idea to have them.#Statement-opinion
We've had, um, in the past, we've had birds, too, uh, like Cockatoos.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And parrots and,#Other
Now, ar-,#Uninterpretable
the, the Cockatoos, are those the big ones?#Yes-No-Question
The big white,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
birds with the, the orange crest on top.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We've had those,#Statement-non-opinion
and those are neat,#Statement-opinion
they're messy, very messy,#Statement-opinion
Are they?#Backchannel in question form
yeah, and loud.#Other
Oh, a lot louder than a dog, you know,#Statement-opinion
a dog you can tell, stop barking, you know, or whatever.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But the birds, you, it's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever#Statement-non-opinion
but, but they were neat, enjoyable animals to have.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, we've thought about getting an aquarium,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
partly, be-, partly for the cats,#Other
I think the cats would really enjoy it, um,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
with a lid,#Statement-opinion
yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
of course, um,#Appreciation
but so far we just#Statement-non-opinion
and starting up an aqu-, an aquarium,#Statement-non-opinion
we, we're, thinking about getting a saltwater,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they,#Uninterpretable
and they're so, expensive to start up.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes,#Agree/Accept
they are,#Agree/Accept
and in your, the luck of keeping them alive,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
through those first,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, few days.#Other
The, the saltwater fish have so much more color#Statement-opinion
and they're so, much more beautiful,#Statement-opinion
I know they are.#Agree/Accept
Um, the freshwater tank's just,#Uninterpretable
really to me they'll, there's,#Uninterpretable
most of them really aren't that pretty,#Statement-opinion
no.#Agree/Accept
you know, I really do-, I really don't care much for them.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
I don't blame you there,#Appreciation
I think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than,#Agree/Accept
I don't know,#Hedge
those fish are just beautiful.#Statement-opinion
Just so,#Uninterpretable
like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Rather than just little fish.#Statement-opinion
But I don't mind having,#Statement-non-opinion
Wren#Uninterpretable
my daughter had a, like a little goldfish,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a about a year or two ago#Other
and it finally died#Statement-non-opinion
and that was neat,#Statement-non-opinion
but the-, and they're, you know,#Uninterpretable
she can't play with it,#Statement-non-opinion
you can just look at it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
You know, you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I wouldn't, I wouldn't dare have a, a goldfish here because,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
it would probably be in a small bowl#Other
and then my cats would knock it over.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have to be real careful about where I put things,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if the cats will, will jump up on things and knock things over all the time,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
Oh, no.#Appreciation
They're always up where they don't, where they're not supposed to be.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's hard.#Appreciation
that's just like kids, you know,#Statement-opinion
yo-, they know that they're not supposed to do it,#Statement-opinion
but they're going to do it anyway because they know they're not supposed to.#Statement-opinion
That's right#Agree/Accept
and they're so, independent.#Statement-non-opinion
I love having them for that reason.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and until we got the dog, um, it was real easy to, to go to town for three d-, three day weekend or whatever,#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and now,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's like a major production,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you're gone.#Other
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that is hard.#Agree/Accept
And, I,#Uninterpretable
we knew it,#Statement-non-opinion
but we never even thought that about when we got the dog#Statement-non-opinion
we just saw him, oh,#Statement-non-opinion
he's so, cute,#Quotation
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
let's take him home.#Quotation
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and then the first weekend we had him we had, we were in a apartment, in a two bedroom apartment,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my husband went out of town, and left me with, with the brand new puppy,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, fun.#Appreciation
and I had to work twelve hours that day,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
and so, I left the dog locked in the bedroom#Statement-non-opinion
and I put paper all over the floor.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, when I came home, I opened the door#Statement-non-opinion
and there were chunks of carpet,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
padding everything,#Other
Oh, no.#Appreciation
all over the place#Other
and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
I guess you didn't get your deposit back, did you?#Yes-No-Question
Well, I had the carpet fixed,#Dispreferred answers
Oh, good.#Appreciation
um, I, yeah, I didn't even tell the apartment manager,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
who got it.#Other
Oh, no.#Appreciation
Bless your heart.#Appreciation
But that, that was my first real experience with, with a puppy#Statement-non-opinion
when, when we had our family dog growing up I was eleven or twelve, I think, when we first got him,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I wasn't really involved in the, the paper training,#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, teaching him commands and stuff#Other
so, this was, and to me, a whole new experience.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes#Agree/Accept
it is.#Agree/Accept
Only it wasn't like cats at all.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
no.#Agree/Accept
I wish it was.#Statement-non-opinion
I wish they were in that instinct.#Statement-non-opinion
But they don't.#Uninterpretable
So,#Uninterpretable
Our only problem with our Schnauzer, she's an indoor dog#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
most of the time#Other
and, uh, we found, she's right at a year#Statement-non-opinion
and we finally got her, you know, house trained and everything, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
her only problem is trash.#Statement-non-opinion
If you do not pick the trash up, you know, the container,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and put it on a table or chair or something, she'll knock it over,#Other
I don't care how fu-, full she is,#Statement-non-opinion
so, it's not like she's hungry,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just she wants to get into trouble.#Statement-non-opinion
My cats do that it.#Statement-non-opinion
If I through anything away that's any kind of meat or anything,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like that,#Other
anything that, that they think is good,#Statement-non-opinion
they'll get into the trash,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and how, how tight you have the lid down on it,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
they'll get into it.#Statement-non-opinion
I've come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I hate that.#Statement-non-opinion
And the cat's just looking at me like, sorry.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you shouldn't have left it there.#Quotation
I couldn't help myself.#Quotation
I just hate that when she does that,#Statement-non-opinion
I just, oh,#Uninterpretable
and she knows it's wrong,#Statement-non-opinion
you'll walk in the door#Statement-non-opinion
and she'll cower and go hide under the table.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you, she knows she does wrong.#Statement-non-opinion
But she, uh, she continues to do it,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the problem that we're having with our puppy right now he's not#Statement-non-opinion
he's actually not really a puppy anymore#Statement-non-opinion
he's like sixteen months old,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, but he's still chewing.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, is he?#Backchannel in question form
Um, the last thing he chewed up was, uh, when we ...#Statement-non-opinion

Okay.#Other
What would you rather have?#Wh-Question
Or you want salary too plus what?#Or-Clause
What's most important to you?#Wh-Question
.#Non-verbal
Well, as far as tangible benefits go I would say that, uh, health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care, dental and vision#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as well as good long-term and short-term disability plans, uh, goes a long way toward satisfying my needs.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I'll tell you.#Offers, Options Commits
I think that is the most important thing#Statement-opinion
I've, uh, I'm not working right at the moment#Statement-non-opinion
but the company that I did work for#Statement-non-opinion
excuse me I had health benefits. You know, dental, vision, all that, pension plan, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
now I don't have that, although I do have a pension that I'm drawing from them which, thank God, I had.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, man, I think those medical benefits are the most important. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
You, you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical#Statement-opinion
and, uh, you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your, your compensation package.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I should knock on wood.#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't, you know, had any serious health problems or anything.#Statement-non-opinion
I've only probably been to the doctor a couple of times since I left work#Statement-non-opinion
and it was only for a cold, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and they can't really do anything for you anyhow,#Statement-opinion
so you might as well not even go#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they look at you, say, well you're still breathing, so, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right#Agree/Accept
Oh, you've got a cold.#Collaborative Completion
Go home and take, uh, liquids and, uh, rest.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Other
But,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
uh, that is definitely, the most important.#Statement-opinion
Uh, pension, I guess, is next.#Statement-opinion
Uh, thank God that I had one.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know what happened to the salary employees when, uh, the company went bankrupt#Statement-non-opinion
but I was union,#Statement-non-opinion
so mine was being put into a, like a trust fund, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, but I don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs#Statement-non-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable
I suspect that it just disappeared.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's what I was thinking too.#Agree/Accept
I really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So where,#Uninterpretable
what company do you work for?#Wh-Question
Uh, I work for a little start-up company here in Pittsburgh called Trans Ark. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Um, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Have you heard of them?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
They,#Uninterpretable
we do, uh, distributive system software#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for Unix based workstations#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
No,#No answers
I, I worked for a trucking company P I E, nation wide.#Statement-non-opinion
You probably heard of that#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Ah, yes,#Yes answers
yes.#Yes answers
In fact, my mom drives trucks#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Oh, does she really?#Backchannel in question form
Yes.#Yes answers
Oh, how about that.#Appreciation
So, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I see, uh,#Appreciation
after the merger, uh, you see a lot of Ryder PIE stuff on the road.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you did.#Statement-non-opinion
So, did, did Ryder get out of the business?#Yes-No-Question
Is that what happened or?#Yes-No-Question
Well Ryder and P I E went together#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
and then, then that ended it#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that the merger pretty much ended the whole thing.#Statement-opinion
It really did.#Agree/Accept
It's, it started, I think, a little bit before that#Statement-opinion
but that,#Uninterpretable
when P I E and, and Ryder went together, why that was downhill from then on, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the, the problem with that is, you know, when you leave a job, you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But when, when the company goes bankrupt, I mean, the, they're just cut off completely#Statement-opinion
and you're responsible for your own.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and that's exceedingly expensive.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits.#Statement-non-opinion
We could do that for eighteen months.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But three hundred and fifty dollars a month.#Statement-non-opinion
God, that's terrible.#Statement-opinion
It's definitely excessive.#Agree/Accept
You know.#Other
So, but anyhow, uh, and jobs aren't that hard to find, to get another one that does pay your benefits, you know.#Statement-opinion
True.#Agree/Accept
And a lot of them that,#Statement-opinion
if you do get a job, they don't pay benefits.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're starting to, to cut back. Especially start-ups.#Statement-opinion
I know here at Trans Ark, we get, uh, we get health care#Statement-non-opinion
and that's it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, there's no dental or vision.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the, the short-term disability policy is, is a ninety day policy#Statement-non-opinion
and there is no long-term disability policy.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you know, at least in the case of this particular company, they tend to scrimp a little bit there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, of course, they can use the excuse#Statement-opinion
well, we're start-up.#Quotation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right#Agree/Accept
But you know what's happening is the, disability plan, you know,#Statement-opinion
so many people are lying about their things.#Statement-opinion
God, there's been big articles in the paper about that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, you know, they claim a back injury#Statement-non-opinion
and then someone goes out and spies on them#Statement-non-opinion
and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and everything else, you know.#Other
So I don't know what's happening and what's going to happen.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh#Uninterpretable
Well that certainly doesn't help matters any.#Statement-opinion
I mean, you, you get people who are willing to put their neck on the line to get you, you know, these additional benefits,#Statement-opinion

Um, what kind of hobbies do you have?#Wh-Question
Um, I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting, when I do have spare time.#Statement-non-opinion
Really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like cross-stitch too.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I love it.#Statement-non-opinion
I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately.#Statement-non-opinion
That's my case also.#Agree/Accept
I've got a new born#Statement-non-opinion
and there's just no time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Have you been cross-stitching long?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, several years.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband is even interested in it now.#Statement-non-opinion
He likes to help me design, um, you know, projects that are,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a little more customized.#Other
Mine, sort of, he looks at the pattern#Statement-non-opinion
and he says how do you get that from there to the material#Statement-non-opinion
Not that hard.#Statement-opinion
Oh, it's not.#Agree/Accept
I really enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
And once you get started on it, it's just, oh, I just, I love it. *#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do a lot of my own patterns also.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In fact, I did one, BILL THE CAT, you know, from Glenn County#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, uh, was a real good one to do.#Other
It was tough,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, yeah.#Uninterpretable
Do you have any others,#Yes-No-Question
or is this mainly cross-stitching?#Or-Clause
Um, I do mostly that, um,#Statement-non-opinion
not very artistic really for like painting and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um,#Uninterpretable
But, now I don't know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Other
I'm still trying to get all the D M C colors#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've got the kits to put them all in.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't have them all yet#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
certainly.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I got to counting the other day#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I think I have, what was it two hundred,#Statement-non-opinion
and I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this is, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it, yeah, it can add up quick.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
I just, I just keep an inventory of what I currently have,#Statement-non-opinion
and then when I start a new project, I go through and see if I, if I, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
just buy the colors that I need#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of what I'm low on.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I see.#Appreciation
Well, now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead, you know, what comes close.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because a lot of them are similar.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
A lot of times you can do that.#Statement-opinion
I think, I#Uninterpretable
the pinks, there's like forty-two different shades of pink.#Statement-non-opinion
Good grief#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's lots of pinks and greens.#Statement-non-opinion
Pinks and greens.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There's lots of shades of greens.#Statement-non-opinion
But the colors,#Uninterpretable
I just love all the different colors.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They had quite a few new ones come out last year, that they added to.#Statement-non-opinion
But, you don't have much spare time either?#Yes-No-Question
Well, not lately#Negative non-no answers
I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Response Acknowledgement
And that does take some time.#Statement-opinion
And if we're trying to get acclimated with the, uh, with having a baby,#Statement-non-opinion
and .#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How old?#Wh-Question
He's seven months old.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And just into everything,#Statement-non-opinion
so there's not a spare moment.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Oh, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.#Statement-non-opinion
I've been trying to do some bibs for him.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, work on his Christmas stocking.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We missed it last year,#Statement-non-opinion
so hopefully this year he'll have one.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, last year he was a little bit young for having one.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
He wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
You would have#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Agree/Accept
If it tasted good, yeah.#Statement-non-opinion
All he liked was the lights this year,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, well, that's neat that you like cross-stitching also.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's, that's kind of strange that we got the same call.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's a call.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I'm sorry.#Apology
Go ahead.#Action-directive
No,#Reject
that's okay.#Downplayer
Okay uh,#Agree/Accept
but, yeah,#Uninterpretable
I've been doing it for probably ten years or so.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
No,#Uninterpretable
I just started about, well, five years ago, I think.#Statement-non-opinion
But it is peaceful,#Statement-opinion
I mean it is relaxing to do, once you find the time to do it.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There's also a couple of large projects, baby afghans,#Statement-non-opinion
and I got one done#Statement-non-opinion
and I think the other one is going. The child is going to be in high school before I get finished.#Statement-non-opinion
On that, uh#Uninterpretable
Bear thing .#Uninterpretable
is it one of those afghans that I've seen in the packages with the, with the large squares?#Yes-No-Question
Well, yeah#Yes answers
I just, I bought the cloth and the pattern for it.#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't, um, I didn't buy the, uh, I didn't buy a kit.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's that cloth.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
It's an-, cloth I think.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it has the borders and everything already.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Those are pretty.#Appreciation
Number one turned out just great,#Statement-non-opinion
and the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors, that they had decorated the nursery#Statement-non-opinion
and I didn't even know it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's a .#Appreciation
I gave it to her#Statement-non-opinion
and she said how did you know those are the colors we used.#Statement-non-opinion
I said didn't#Statement-non-opinion
That was a good .#Appreciation
It worked out that way.#Statement-non-opinion
That's great.#Appreciation
Uh, that, uh,#Uninterpretable
now I've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like those.#Statement-non-opinion
Those are pretty.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Lilly, Lilly , she said, she said it's for your daughter to use.#Statement-non-opinion

She said, I know she doesn't get to touch it.#Statement-non-opinion
She hung it on the wall.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
my, uh, grandmother, um, made us a couple of quilts for the baby,#Statement-non-opinion
and I was like, oh, I don't want to mess those up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, they're just too nice.#Statement-opinion
I mean you don't get many hand made quilts anymore.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
True.#Agree/Accept

Okay,#Other
so, um,#Uninterpretable
yes#Uninterpretable
we do keep, uh, well we started out keeping a budget about two years, ago,#Statement-non-opinion
we have a computer, here at the house,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our, our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month#Statement-non-opinion
and then basically since then what I've done is, is keep track of it through the checkbook#Statement-non-opinion
so that based on whatever we've got coming in, the check coming in, then how much I'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also spe-,#Statement-non-opinion
because our house payment is once a month,#Statement-non-opinion
that's our, our biggest, uh, expense#Statement-non-opinion
so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook each, with each paycheck,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even thought it's really still there,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that I can keep, uh, uh, good balance,#Other
A running total.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a running total, yeah through the month,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What do you all do?#Open-Question
Uh, we've, we've, uh, taken how much we have, you know, write down how much we have coming in each month#Statement-non-opinion
and then, uh, we've,#Uninterpretable
at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend.#Statement-non-opinion
We sat dow-, made up different accounts like, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
we've set a budget for each, you know, household expenses, or food, and clothing and entertainment and then our, our own fun money and just stuff like that#Statement-non-opinion
and then we write down each, each time we spend something, we write down in a book#Statement-non-opinion
and at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we, you know#Statement-non-opinion
we, we try to stay within a certain budget,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Is it, is it hard to keep track of it#Yes-No-Question
or does it work out pretty well?#Or-Clause
Um, it takes some, it takes some dedication to do it,#Statement-non-opinion
but it, it works out real well,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
And, and you're staying within your budget and keep-,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
everything is working pretty good.#Other
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah,#Yes answers
I stay wi-, I have to stay within it,#Statement-non-opinion
so I, you know,#Uninterpretable
and then we have that, you know,#Uninterpretable
if you can't stay, if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have, uh, you know, a budget for, you know, like we call our slush fund or something#Statement-non-opinion
and some-, an unexpected comes up, then you're not, you know, you don't feel it so strapped.#Statement-opinion
You don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that.#Summarize/reformulate
Right,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
because we don't, you know, we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month.#Statement-non-opinion
That's a good choice,#Appreciation
we've been trying, we're trying to, uh, do that this year.#Statement-non-opinion
We've budgeted the money that we used to spend, we were spending on a CODA account with T I and then money we were also buying stock with for that year,#Statement-non-opinion
we've taken that this year,#Statement-non-opinion
You've got paper under your table.#3rd-party-talk

To be out of that.#Collaborative Completion
that by doing that we'll be free,#Other
Free.#Repeat-phrase
and clear.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the only thing we have, it to pay off is our, is a automobile loan and our house payment,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's the only thing we ever,#Statement-non-opinion
That's good to be in that kind of shape.#Appreciation
We try to stay out of debt#Statement-non-opinion
What are you all trying to do long term.#Wh-Question
Huh. Oh it's long term.#Hold before answer/agreement
We just,#Uninterpretable
he ha-, you know, his retirement plan and then to CODA and stuff like that, that's all we,#Statement-non-opinion
and you know, we just have our life insurance for right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, we don't have any long term, you know, in stocks, or anything like that right now,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
mostly what we're doing, we've worked, we've done the, uh, CODA account with T I where they, we put in so much a month,#Statement-non-opinion
and then they, or so much a pay check and then they match it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's what we're doing.#Statement-non-opinion
So that's, that's worked out pretty good#Statement-non-opinion
and then, I used to work for T I#Statement-non-opinion
and I have,#Uninterpretable
when I retired from there, or left, I took the money I that I had in mine and put it in an I R A#Statement-non-opinion
and we had an out, we had an existing I R A#Statement-non-opinion
so we have, both of us have some money in an I R A that we're also trying to figure,#Statement-non-opinion
to, put it, we're putting it in C D's right now,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when ever we get enough saved we stick it in a C D for a while#Statement-non-opinion
and, then, uh, you know and then when, if we need it we wait until it, it's expired#Statement-non-opinion
and then so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The other thing that we've done, that, that was really nice to see, we had one of the financial companies, um,#Statement-non-opinion
han-, uh, John Hancock company came out#Statement-non-opinion
and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and, uh, what we were pla-, what, what our, uh, goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement, kids college, paying off the house, buying a different house,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, special thing, buying land and building our own house#Other
and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then gave us a good idea back, you know, some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals,#Other
or not,#Collaborative Completion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
and, or not, and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That sounds interesting,#Appreciation
we've never done any-,#Statement-non-opinion
we have,#Uninterpretable
you know, just our, our life insurance guy has come out, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and he's set up, uh, you know, determined how much we need to, you know, we need if something were to happen.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, that's the other financial thing I guess that we've done is with our life insurance is, since I'm at home now is, is figuring out, uh, what we would need if something happened to my husband, or what he would need if something happened to me,#Statement-non-opinion
that's a, a big thing to think about.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
yeah, you know,#Agree/Accept
if, I would sell the, you know,#Uninterpretable
if, he, something would happen to him, I wouldn't stay in Texas,#Statement-non-opinion
I would, uh, sell the house and move back home, you know, to my home town,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, uh, I wouldn't stay here in Texas,#Statement-non-opinion
so you know, I don't know what he would do.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess that's most of my, um, financial plans right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
mine too.#Statement-non-opinion
Is, is there anything you'd like to add?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers

Okay, Bill,#Other

Yes.#Yes answers
Okay, Bill,#Response Acknowledgement
have you done much camping?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, yes.#Yes answers
I'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I camp, uh, every month, uh, camp at least one weekend#Statement-non-opinion
and during the summer we camp, uh, two or three weeks a year#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, that, that sounds good.#Appreciation
I'd say I camp quite a bit.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you do.#Agree/Accept
Um, now do you have a lot mountains,#Yes-No-Question
well, you don't have mountains in Texas, do you.#Yes-No-Question
Where do you find places to camp?#Wh-Question
Well, uh, we, we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
and we, uh, we also, uh, carry all our equipment with us#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so we canoe down the river and then,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
sleep on the river on one of the, um, sand bars and then#Other
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
get up the next morning, cook our breakfast, and go down the river again.#Other
Oh, my word.#Appreciation
Well that sounds adventuresome#Appreciation
How about yourself?#Open-Question
Well, um, I've done, oh, I would say quite a bit of camping, mostly with my husband and I.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, we have five children,#Statement-non-opinion
and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves.#Statement-non-opinion
So we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out,#Statement-non-opinion
and we have gone up into the mountains and, uh, not necessarily roughed it,#Statement-non-opinion
but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
And, then the boys are, our boys are old enough now,#Statement-non-opinion
they're twelve and eleven,#Statement-non-opinion
and so, they're involved in the scouting#Statement-non-opinion
and they do a lot of camping with the scouts#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week,#Statement-non-opinion
and so this year they'll both be going,#Statement-non-opinion
and so that's been real enjoyable for them.#Statement-non-opinion
Great.#Appreciation
So.#Uninterpretable
What, uh, what kind of camping do they like best?#Wh-Question
Do they like it where they have tents#Yes-No-Question
and, uh, do they cook on stoves?#Yes-No-Question
Um, yes,#Yes answers
they've, well,#Uninterpretable
no,#No answers
actually they've, I remember, they have taken the, the du-, the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire,#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't think they've taken the stoves.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, last year they camped in tents,#Statement-non-opinion
and this year I believe they will be in tents also.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh,#Yes answers
yeah.#Yes answers
It doesn't get very cold in Texas,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
so lots of times we don't even take tents.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, is that right?#Backchannel in question form
We just use trail tarps.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, and what does that consist of?#Wh-Question
Uh, it's just a piece of material that has, uh, that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
and make it into a tent#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, like a, uh,#Other
they're very light weight#Statement-non-opinion
and we use them when we go backpacking.#Statement-non-opinion
So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles, then, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
they're not very heavy, see#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so you carry them with you,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
they'll keep you dry or whatever.#Other
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, see, when, when we go camping here,#Statement-non-opinion
we have to take our big huge, heavy sleeping bags, and lots of tents#Statement-non-opinion
and, I like to sleep on the air matresses.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not,#Uninterpretable
my bones are getting so old,#Statement-non-opinion
so I like to, I like to sleep on the matresses.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, so, have you had any adventures on your camping trips, with, encounters with wild animals or anything like that?#Yes-No-Question
Ye-, yes,#Yes answers
in fact, uh, um, last month we went camping,#Statement-non-opinion
we saw a lot of deer#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
uh, in the morning and the afternoon#Other
My word.#Appreciation
just deer everywhere.#Other
Gee.#Appreciation
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, uh, but, it, even though, uh, it wasn't hunting season,#Statement-non-opinion
and we were with Boy Scouts,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of course we don't, uh, want to go hunting.#Other
.#Non-verbal
But we got to see a lot of deer#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
um, out and about#Other
and there's,#Uninterpretable
of course, we see smaller animals all the time,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, one thing that is a big concern in the evening, at night, uh, is, uh, make sure that all the food's put away and so forth#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because, uh, we have, uh, armadillos.#Other
Do you know what#Yes-No-Question
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
armadillo is?#Other
Uh, they're covered like with a heavy armor#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
type stuff,#Other
uh-huh.#Yes answers
And possums, and, uh, raccoons.#Statement-non-opinion
My word.#Appreciation
And we have those creatures down here that they like to, uh, they like to go hunting for a midnight snack.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so that, that, uh, that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away.#Statement-non-opinion
But they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything.#Or-Clause
They will if you attack them.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
But most time they run away from you#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if they, if they see you're up, you know#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my word#Appreciation
So.#Uninterpretable
Well, that sounds a little less fierce than bears.#Statement-opinion
We, we want to,#Uninterpretable

I guess we're ready to talk.#Statement-non-opinion
How you doing, Howard?#Conventional-opening
This is a, a subject that I'm not real well versed on,#Statement-non-opinion
but.#Uninterpretable
Well, let's talk about air pollution.#Action-directive
Okay.#Agree/Accept
What do you think causes air pollution in Dallas?#Wh-Question
Or where are you from?#Wh-Question
No.#Other
Maybe you're not in Dallas.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Okay,#Other
I'm from the, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm from Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm in Richardson.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay. Uh,#Response Acknowledgement
What do you think as far as air pollution in the Dallas area?#Open-Question
Well, I have some small experience in this area.#Statement-non-opinion
The brown haze that you see if you look down Central towards downtown#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a lot of that is, uh, tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some of the kind of bluish gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates.#Other
But, uh, the, one of the major problems that Dallas has is oxides and nitrogen.#Statement-non-opinion
That's because of all the equipment that's being operated. But at the same time, uh, because we don't have, we don't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
don't get a lot of particulates.#Other
Now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, power plants since,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
many of our local power plants, uh, are natural gas most of the time, uh, the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide, and N O X.#Statement-non-opinion
There's no particulates in natural gas, of course.#Statement-non-opinion
And we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products.#Statement-non-opinion
We're burning fuel oil and a few other things,#Statement-non-opinion
but gasoline, of course, now the lead's out, at least theoretically, uh, I guess you could say we're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur.#Statement-non-opinion
That's why we get that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
the sulphur, yes.#Other
And that's, uh, course hydrogen sulfide, which is when you burn gasoline, you also produce some water vapor#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that goes back in with your sulphur#Other
and under the right condition you get H two S.#Statement-non-opinion
But, anyway, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, you are, you are well versed on the subject, I tell you.#Statement-opinion
Well, I don't know.#Downplayer
This is not one of my better ones.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess, I guess I notice it the most just, uh, in driving around Dallas with all the, the highway equipment that's working on the#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on, six thirty-five and seventy-five, just the cars in general.#Other
That's where I see most of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Ro-,#Uninterpretable
uh, Ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And when they run rich they, they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's another part of the problem.#Statement-non-opinion
The gas is not being burned completely.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, hopefully, if we ever get our road system fixed up, this will get a lot better.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I don't know, I've lived here since seventy-four, Howard,#Statement-non-opinion
and, I d-, I think, I think they been working on the highways around here since I've been here,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and I think, I think they'll be working on them long after my wife and I are gone.#Statement-opinion
Well, I guess, I, not trying to top you, but I grew up in Dallas county and I can remember when they built the north part of North Central which was built after the south part of#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Central#Other
and, uh, I can remember coming over the hill down there long about, uh, I don't know, little bit north of mark-, Mockingbird on up in, over those hills#Statement-non-opinion
and I said I wonder if they'll ever need this road.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Course, it was designed for most of us to go about forty-five miles an hour because the short on ramps and are, off ramps,#Statement-non-opinion
but, gosh,#Appreciation
seems like, uh, those ramps might kill us yet.#Statement-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
hopefully the new ones will be a lot better.#Statement-non-opinion
I understand.#Appreciation
I sure hope so, I tell you.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, you get out on the, uh, interstate highways versus,#Statement-non-opinion
I travel quite a bit#Statement-non-opinion
and traveling from, like, Dallas to Austin to San Antonio it's the same thing as far as the pollution created by the automobiles in the, in the stalled traffic and the busy highways, you, you, you're at your best#Statement-non-opinion
and, I guess when you're out on the interstate, heading north or south and you're just cruising right along and there's no build up of cars#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Ron, have you noticed when you're driving south on thirty-five, I guess towards Waxahachie, Hillsborough on down to Austin,#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
you hit a point down there about, I think where they call Bear Creek exit#Other
Yes.#Yes answers
on just this side of the county line#Other
Right along in there somewhere, suddenly the air feels cleaner.#Statement-non-opinion
Have you noticed that?#Yes-No-Question
I tell you what, I, I don't think I really have,#Negative non-no answers
but I'm going that way Tuesday#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm going to make it a point to.#Offers, Options Commits
Well, sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, I also travel a little bit#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I don't know, it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier.#Statement-non-opinion
It may be all in my mind.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I know.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
I know going to, uh, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I detest going to Houston because it's such a,#Statement-non-opinion

Here goes Sharon.#Other
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars?#Open-Question
That's the only thing I found out tonight#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you found that out tonight?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
I haven't even heard that,#Hold before answer/agreement
that's great.#Appreciation
I think he deserves every penny of it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players would.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
Wonder because football,#Uninterpretable
And they play a lot, they play a lot longer season, too.#Statement-non-opinion
And a lot more games, right?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
that's exactly right.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I think, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement

Rangers have got a new guy this year,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't even remember his name either.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you ever go see the Rangers?#Yes-No-Question
Every once in a while I, I like to go on the nights when there's not anybody out there, not very many people out there.#Affirmative non-yes answers
It's a lot more fun when your not fighting a crowd.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I think it's fun,#Statement-opinion
I like just looking at the billboards.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Cou-,#Uninterpretable
And your going to be able to buy your,#Yes-No-Question

Well, they're trying.#Statement-opinion

It's so stupid because they let you take it in there,#Statement-opinion
but they don't, they don't allow you to sell it, don't allow them to sell it there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, that new stadium's going to be real nice,#Statement-non-opinion

right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's going to go to the highest bidder#Statement-non-opinion

and then they throw it out, and get something else, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you get tired of that.#Statement-opinion
That's typical bureaucracy though.#Statement-opinion

That's, that's, I think it's going to be any where you go#Statement-opinion
it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones,#Statement-opinion

I don't know,#Hedge
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad.#Statement-opinion
Well, but they can't be though,#Reject
they don't have as much money.#Statement-opinion

Or working in the system.#Declarative Yes-No-Question

So, how long are we suppose to talk for?#Wh-Question
Well, you can talk for ten minutes#Statement-non-opinion
but you don't have to.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you can?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
and no,#No answers
if you talk to ten then they come ov-, on and say, oh, you've extended your limit,#Statement-non-opinion
and please say good-bye within the next five seconds.#Quotation
Oh, I haven't ever talked that long.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you know, I hadn't either till last night, I was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland, Ohio,#Statement-non-opinion

and it went over ten minutes.#Statement-non-opinion
Did she, did she, did you all not talk about the topic at all?#Yes-No-Question
Well, yeah,#Yes answers
we did,#Statement-non-opinion
but the topic was boring I thought.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
What would you serve, uh, if you were having a dinner party?#Wh-Question
Oh, gosh, all the other,#Uninterpretable
the one I talked about the other night was good,#Statement-non-opinion

Oh yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I could go on and on about that.#Statement-non-opinion
Me, too, because we go all the time,#Statement-non-opinion

he was, boy it sounds like your really up on this.#Statement-non-opinion
I said, I see at least two a week#Statement-non-opinion
Ugh, neat.#Appreciation
So, that was real good to talk about that.#Statement-non-opinion
Have you seen like, uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?#Yes-No-Question

we talked about that one too.#Statement-non-opinion
And he, he said he didn't think it should have gotten all those awards, he thought it was too long#Statement-non-opinion
but I,#Uninterpretable

I did, too.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it was just more for my money.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I didn't think it was too long at all.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch.#Statement-non-opinion

The other one you need to go see is SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.#Action-directive
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
And, how old are your kids?#Wh-Question
One is eight#Statement-non-opinion
and one is eleven.#Statement-non-opinion
You probably don't want to take them to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.#Action-directive
It's, it's not, it's not too cool for kids.#Statement-opinion
They usually pick their own.#Statement-non-opinion
I bet they do.#Appreciation
You know, they've got it all figured out.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they want to see all the horror movies.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, and Ninja Turtles.#Dispreferred answers

That's what we do, especially when it's bad weather, man, just,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
plug it in.#Other
Of course, you have to get there early if you want to get anything,#Statement-opinion
I know#Agree/Accept

It's good when you go to Tom Thumb though#Statement-opinion
and they're cheap#Statement-opinion

I don't have the patience to read#Statement-non-opinion
See I do that to make myself go to sleep at night.#Statement-non-opinion

Oh, my Mom and Dad read all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
You saw FIELD OF DREAMS, right, a long time ago?#Yes-No-Question

Well, I was reading the book,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's called SHOELESS JOE.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
It was so wonderful.#Statement-non-opinion
And then I was, um, I decided, well, I like this author,#Statement-non-opinion
so I got a, uh, book of his short stories,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's been real good.#Statement-non-opinion
Who is the, is the author?#Wh-Question
Don't, don't ask me#Other answers
Oh#Response Acknowledgement
The GHOST OF SHOELESS JOE was the name of the book.#Statement-non-opinion
Shoeless Joe.#Repeat-phrase
Was it like the movie?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
quite a, quite a bit.#Statement-non-opinion
But, you know, in the movie the guy was black,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he wasn't in the book,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's one difference.#Statement-non-opinion
There really wasn't a lot of difference.#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't,#Statement-non-opinion
see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie.#Statement-non-opinion
That's interesting.#Appreciation
That was a good movie, too.#Statement-opinion
Well, do you think we covered baseball?#Yes-No-Question
I think so#Affirmative non-yes answers
Okay,#Conventional-closing

Well I always think I'm paying too much taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
How about you?#Open-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
oh definitely#Affirmative non-yes answers
Seems like,#Uninterpretable
Although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you know, they keep threatening us that maybe there will be a day that they're going to, uh, enact this I think, uh, the, um, other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling#Statement-non-opinion
so they keep trying to say we may need a, uh, state income tax#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think that, uh, we probably will have to have, have to, uh, have a state income tax because, uh, Texans don't approve of such things as lotteries, uh, well I, I, come here from New York#Statement-non-opinion
and New York had a state lottery,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it really raised a lot of money for the, for the state.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Uh, although we,#Uninterpretable
in New York we had to pay a state and a city, uh, tax.#Statement-non-opinion
And it was really a great relief when I got to Texas that I didn't have to pay that city income tax, though.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
makes quite a bit of difference in your, uh, well your income level.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, because other states quite a bi-, a chunk out for, uh, city and state taxes#Statement-non-opinion
so you're, uh, looking at your yearly salary, it makes quite a difference.#Statement-opinion
It sure does ma-, make a difference.#Agree/Accept
A little more take home here#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you live in Dallas?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
Richardson area.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you do?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
I work at, well mainly the Expressway Site is where I work#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I do too.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay#Response Acknowledgement
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then, you know too, that, um, taxes are, are less, like if you live in Mesquite.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, some people will go shopping in Mesquite at the malls out there, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Or up to Collin County, somewhere that you're getting out of the, um, Dallas County area because,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
what do we pay, like eight and a half percent,#Other
Eight point five.#Summarize/reformulate
something like that for the, uh, sales tax.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which, yeah, that really is pretty high.#Statement-non-opinion
Is it the s-,#Yes-No-Question
is it, uh, less in Collin County than it is in Dallas County?#Yes-No-Question
I think so, although I really, I don't go up there too much, I mean I, I normally just kind of go to Richardson Square Mall, or Valley View Mall just kind of for the convenience, * Looks like 2 slash units#Affirmative non-yes answers
or I guess maybe if I was going to buy a car or something,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
maybe I would consider where I was buying it, to try to, you know,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
save a little bit on that sales tax, because on a car that really mo-, kind of mounts up#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it sure did#Statement-non-opinion
and then once you could deduct at least some of that, um, off, off your income tax#Statement-non-opinion
and you can't do that anymore.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It really hit me yesterday, I had, uh, air conditioning service for my car done.#Statement-non-opinion
And I had a little, little, uh, coupon special that was twenty-two dollars#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for, um, air conditioning service where they, uh, checked it and ch-, recharged it and put one, one pound of freon in#Other
and if you needed another pound of freon they ga-,#Statement-non-opinion
it, it was like seven dollars and something.#Statement-non-opinion
And then with the with the twenty-two dollars and the seven something, it all came out to, I, I ended up paying like thirty-four dollars.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And I couldn't believe it and the tax, you know, really hits you. * both kinds of slash error; Should be 2 slash units, I think#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Other
And then, * slash error#Other
Although I wi-, I wish, you know, overall they'd try the lottery again.#Statement-opinion
When did you first come to Texas?#Wh-Question
Oh, it's been, I've been here for nine years. *#Other
Okay, well, that's about the same time as me, I came down in eighty-two. * Looks like 3 slash units here to me.#Response Acknowledgement
Really, where did you come from?#Wh-Question
Um, well, Ohio, kind of.#Statement-non-opinion
My parents live in Ohio.#Statement-non-opinion
I had lived a little while in Michigan,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Response Acknowledgement
but, you know, basically I went to high school and college in Ohio and lived there uh, more years than I ever did in Michigan.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, uh, I did visit, uh, Michigan, I visited Kalamazoo once.#Statement-non-opinion
My sister used to live there.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay#Response Acknowledgement
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But you know, when we first came down here, I really thought this place was somewhat backward, I mean, I was just shocked that we couldn't shop on Sunday.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Remember that?#Yes-No-Question
That's true, I tell you what hit me the first year I was here, uh, Christmas eve in New York there used to be stores open, the department stores wouldn't close, uh, * There seem to be several slash units in this turn that were not parsed that way#Other
.#Non-verbal
well I'd say they closed maybe eight or nine o'clock, department stores, on Christmas eve.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, there were stores that you could go to, uh, you know, like discount stores and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to#Statement-non-opinion
and you could shop until like twelve or one o'clock that night#Statement-non-opinion
and that was like, that was really the only night they were open that late,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was Christmas eve.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And when I came to Dallas, I thought I was going to do that Christmas eve#Statement-non-opinion
and I couldn't find hardly anything open,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
after five o'clock in the afternoon.#Other
Were you shocked like, oh no, I'm stuck I need to buy stuff.#Yes-No-Question
An I was, oh, I was, I really, I really was stuck#Affirmative non-yes answers
And I think Target was the one that stayed open later than any, anybody else.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, I was able to pick up a few things in there,#Statement-non-opinion
but, boy I was, I was really shocked.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And then another shock I had well, when I went to, um, to buy a slice of pizza#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and found out that I had to buy the whole pie.#Other
Oh, few places now seem to do it by the slice#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
now,#Uninterpretable
but they,#Uninterpretable
back then they didn't.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
When I first came, no.#Statement-non-opinion
Anyway,#Uninterpretable
Well the, the, uh, there was other things too, I mean, I think it's taken us Yankee's influence down here,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to get them to, uh, come to the, you know, the correct decade here and century.#Other
Um, I couldn't believe that you could have open containers of beer, alcohol, whatever,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the car!#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you could always, um, uh, be careful about that back then because,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, you know, if yo-, if a cop stopped you then you would, um, you know, get arrested or what not.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and talk a#Action-directive
And people would just drink openly.#Statement-non-opinion
talking about alcohol and beer, look at the taxes on that,#Other
.#Non-verbal
and the taxes on a package of, of cigarettes.#Other
I used to smoke, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, that would have been enough to, to make me, me give them up.#Statement-non-opinion
The price of them now,#Statement-non-opinion
but I gave them up a couple years ago because I had some sinus problems.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
W-,#Uninterpretable
I don't smoke,#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't really know what the,#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
taxes are and stuff on it.#Other
Well they're like two,#Statement-non-opinion
or, I, I believe they're hitting two dollars a pack now.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A little bit, a little bit more in some places.#Statement-non-opinion
So you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes.#Summarize/reformulate
Uh, well, I believe it's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton, * slash error#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it's maybe thirteen or something.#Other
Gee.#Appreciation
Um, because I remember we went to, to Oklahoma to th-, this bingo place. This Choctaw Bingo, uh, a couple weeks ago#Statement-non-opinion
and somebody that went with me bought a carton for, uh, ten dollars and something#Statement-non-opinion
and they really thought they were getting a big discount.#Statement-non-opinion
They're cheaper there?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well because, it's, you know, the Indians, I don't think they pay tax.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Oh!#Appreciation
In, in Oklahoma.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I got you,#Response Acknowledgement
okay.#Response Acknowledgement
And, uh, it was a Indian, well it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the Indians there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Although I didn't see very many Indian people in there#Statement-non-opinion
There were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's, it's, the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth.#Statement-non-opinion
Well how did you do?#Wh-Question
I won a dollar#Statement-non-opinion
A dollar, oh well,#Repeat-phrase
but you had fun playing, right.#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I had fun, uh, a couple on the bus won some money.#Statement-non-opinion
One, one guy won t-,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay.#Other
So Frank, what, uh, type of, uh, budget do you or your family have?#Wh-Question
Well, uh I don't know that we really have a budget.#Statement-non-opinion
I have a set amount that I, that I save.#Statement-non-opinion
Actually, well actually there is a, a way,#Statement-non-opinion
budget our money apparently.#Statement-non-opinion
The,#Uninterpretable
uh, my wife, uh, has so much, uh, gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff, gas, and things like that#Statement-non-opinion
and besides that I, uh, you know, I have a set amount that I save every month.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's, uh, sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I am single,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess, I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget,#Other
but I basically,#Uninterpretable
Really don't need to.#Collaborative Completion
Right,#Agree/Accept
I don't need to.#Repeat-phrase
I am the only that I have to keep track of#Statement-non-opinion
so it makes it a little bit easier.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Uh, and also I, you know, I try to save a certain amount each month as well#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I try to, try to have an idea of what my expenses are#Statement-non-opinion
and I am pretty consistent from month to month#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, whenever, uh, I need to, uh, whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I found that, uh, you know, things, as I have gotten older,#Statement-non-opinion
I am in my fifties now,#Statement-non-opinion
but before we use to have, to have to have a very strict budget,#Statement-non-opinion
I had four kids#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for, for this and for that.#Statement-non-opinion
Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I set aside, uh, I kind of fence off areas of my check book.#Statement-non-opinion
For instance, there are certain things that I know come up, uh, every so often.#Statement-non-opinion
Every six months I have to pay car insurance.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, every six months I have to pay my taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
So#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I take a set amount.#Other
I've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh, uh, saving in#Statement-non-opinion
and I also have got a checking account besides that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, what I do on my money market account, my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. I will just take two hundred and twenty out#Statement-non-opinion
and I put it in parenthesis.#Statement-non-opinion
I take it out of the right line total#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up.#Other
Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it.#Statement-non-opinion
Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I guess that's a way of budgeting.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
That's,#Uninterpretable
I guess I kind of do a similar thing. More, uh, medium or longer range.#Statement-non-opinion
I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for.#Statement-non-opinion
Like I am,#Uninterpretable
probably within a year I would like to buy a new car.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I kind of have a, an amount in my mind#Statement-non-opinion
and I am making every effort to, to sal-, put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget. Not only for buying them, but for keeping them on the road too.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you know, we've got two cars.#Statement-non-opinion
My wife has a car#Statement-non-opinion
and I like to drive pick up truck.#Statement-non-opinion
So, we are on a schedule where I try every, uh, three or four years to, to buy a new one.#Statement-non-opinion
And you know I am constantly making car payments,#Statement-non-opinion
but I figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway, is making car payments.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, you know, I get one paid for#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, actually I am saving up for another one besides#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's you know, it's kind of a never ending thing,#Other
but#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Other
you try to, you try to schedule those things so that, uh, you only, you're not paying for two of at the same time#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess is what I am saying.#Other
Have you thought about, uh, leasing?#Yes-No-Question
Well, uh, I have thought about it,#Affirmative non-yes answers
but leasing wouldn't,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, I don't use it for my business.#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Response Acknowledgement
My wife uses hers just for pleasure#Statement-non-opinion
and I use mine just to go back and forth to work#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which is only ten miles away#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
But if you are rolling it over every three years,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
it might be advantageous to do that.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I guess.#Agree/Accept
Uh,#Uninterpretable
You know, typically, you, if you purchase your own car you tend to make, uh, the best returns after you pay it off.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Of course, the longer you keep it beyond that point, the more profitable it is to own it yourself.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you're right.#Agree/Accept
Uh, I have, uh, been know to keep trucks or cars for oh, ten or twelve years,#Statement-non-opinion
but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill#Statement-non-opinion
and you got to put put stuff in them you know.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
mine's, uh, seven years old#Statement-non-opinion
and I think last year was, that was a rough year for it.#Statement-non-opinion
I had a number of expenses#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I am hoping that most of them were just kind of,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, you know the,#Uninterpretable
as you get to a certain number of miles, you have to get everything replaced, brakes, shocks and all that.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I just went through that whole set last year.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again#Statement-non-opinion
Those things can really upset your budget when they, when they come in.#Statement-opinion
Uh, you know, it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the, for the unexpected shall we say.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that it doesn't, uh, kill you all in one month.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What line of work are you in?#Wh-Question

Okay Jerry.#Other
Ok-,#Other
I guess, uh, tonight's topic is about, uh, personal computers and level of interest and, uh, and your, your expertise.#Statement-non-opinion
Oops#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Oh, well.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, well.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, let's, let's fire away.#Action-directive
Uh, well, Brian,#Uninterpretable
Okay.#Agree/Accept
Well, first of all,#Uninterpretable
you want me to start off?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
why don't you, why don't we, why don't you do about thirty seconds#Action-directive
and I'll do thirty seconds#Offers, Options Commits
and then we can work off of there.#Action-directive
Okay,#Agree/Accept
real, real fine.#Agree/Accept
Uh, first of all, uh, yes,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, I do own a P C here at home#Statement-non-opinion
and I also have one at the office.#Statement-non-opinion
And my level of interest is quite high with P C -s#Statement-non-opinion
and I was really, I am really interested in them, however, not to the extent as I was about, uh, two years ago when I basically knew about everything there was to know about different things#Statement-non-opinion
and that was the time when we were shopping for one.#Statement-non-opinion
And I think we got a top of the line at that time,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, as you know P C -s change quite rapidly#Statement-non-opinion
and the technological advances kind of outdated our P C where I can get the same P C I got two years ago at the fraction of the cost.#Statement-non-opinion
And I also enjoy using ours at home#Statement-non-opinion
and we use it for a, a number of different things.#Statement-non-opinion
Plus I get in a lot, an awful lot of good use of one at work, where I work.#Statement-non-opinion
Lot of, uh, analytical, uh, testing, reviews, uh, lot of different things I use it at h-, at work,#Statement-non-opinion
so I enjoy P C -s#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they make my w-, life and my work a lot easier.#Statement-non-opinion
How about yourself?#Open-Question
Well, uh, since, uh,#Uninterpretable
well, I guess since this time last year I've changed, uh, jobs within the firm I'm with#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I now am learning to be a sys admin on, on, not only P C -s, but, uh, pers-, uh, professional work stations#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
as well.#Other
All right.#Appreciation
And these are the big mamas, i. e. sons, uh, Hewlett Packards, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, sor-, uh, oh, the big Solburns and, and so forth.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, h-,#Uninterpretable
and, and, uh, we have, uh, two P C -s here.#Statement-non-opinion
We have, uh, an X T#Statement-non-opinion
and then recently we, we made a, the command decision to go ahead and get, uh, the absolute top of the line because spouse is a, uh, programmer.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so we got one that,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that could do enough, uh, and, you know, hold three different O S -s.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
As far as DOS, uh, UNIX, and, uh, O S Two.#Other
Oh, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, I, I get to see all kinds of different applications.#Statement-non-opinion
Sounds like you're an expert at it, too.#Statement-opinion
No,#Downplayer
no.#Downplayer
.#Non-verbal
Learning,#Downplayer
I'm learning t-, I'm learning to be, uh, one who knows what's he's doing#Downplayer
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, expert,#Rhetorical-Questions
no#No answers
Oh, well, well.#Uninterpretable
I frown on that, that term because, uh, too many people, s-, you know, uh, misuse the word#Statement-opinion
so,#Other
.#Non-verbal
I'd rather say I'm, I, I am continually learning,#Other
but my area, m-, my level of expertise is increasing almost daily.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's great, be-,#Appreciation
And, uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, I've got a P C and a work station at work#Statement-non-opinion
and I#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we have two P C -s here w-, at home.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the,#Uninterpretable
a lot of the, the, the new mama we're, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I've got Aldus and, uh, Micrographics on it as far as, uh, technical publishing#Statement-non-opinion
and we do a, quite a bit of church work with ours.#Statement-non-opinion
Great.#Appreciation
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
We do an awful lot of that, too with ours.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, some,#Uninterpretable
I, I, I've found that, uh, the more we do with it, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it seem,#Uninterpretable
and the Lord's just pleased that we're kind of,#Statement-opinion
this is, this is, part of giving back a portion of what He's given to us.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So, uh, I don't mind, because seems like the more we do, there's, there's the more stuff that's, uh, available that comes along and so forth.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
And,#Uninterpretable
Definitely agree with that.#Agree/Accept
So, uh, rather than being niggardly and, and, chintzy, uh, we've just said, you bet, boss, seeing as he was the one that, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
enabled us to get the money to buy the Four Eighty-Six.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because the top of the line we've got,#Statement-non-opinion
well, we've got a compatible.#Statement-non-opinion

uh,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Eight meg of ram and, and two, two, two hundred and eleven hard drives.#Other
Wow,#Appreciation
wow,#Appreciation
you got,#Uninterpretable
that's a Four Eighty-Six processor, too?#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh,#Yes answers
uh-huh.#Yes answers
Wow#Appreciation
Like I said#Statement-non-opinion
That's,#Uninterpretable
we bought a real steam, steam burner.#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, mainly because of spouse's UNIX#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because UNIX#Other
Has to s-,#Other
you have to have that to support UNIX.#Collaborative Completion
takes a, a, c-, a well, four megs minimum#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of RAM.#Collaborative Completion
of RAM#Other
and then, uh, it, it, it likes to live on about a hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive.#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So the next size up was a Two Hundred and Eleven#Statement-non-opinion
and so rather than just have one, we went ahead and got two.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, at some point in time I'm going to do the mirroring, uh, experiment to where one disk mirrors the other for#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
fault tolerance.#Other
Wow,#Appreciation
okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, oh, speak, speak of the angel, she just walked in#Statement-non-opinion
Well, good for her#Statement-non-opinion
T I stuff#3rd-party-talk
So, uh, uh,#Uninterpretable
You say she's a programmer also.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
she's, she's a squirrel for, uh, uh, contractor out at American Airlines.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
Well, great.#Appreciation
Well, she probably needs that kind of a powerful type of a machine to do her work.#Statement-opinion

What kind of painting are you planning to do?#Wh-Question
Well I have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting.#Dispreferred answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, it's a rent house#Statement-non-opinion
and I decided it's too expensive to rewallpaper#Statement-non-opinion
so I decided I'm going to paint.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, what would be interesting.#Appreciation
Either that or maybe rag rolling.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
To give it kind of a country look.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments,#Statement-non-opinion
but they look very interesting#Statement-opinion
and you get some beautiful effects with them.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Uh, one of the books that I bought, where it's d-, describing the sponge painting, said you can like layer different colors#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I've seen that done, where there's uh, oh,#Statement-non-opinion
I saw one that was kind on an ecru undercoat#Statement-non-opinion
and then it had, a little bit darker sort of peachy color,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and in between there was a sort of a rust, uh, put on very sparingly.#Statement-non-opinion
Ugh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, what I, what I'm trying to do is I've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I want something that's going to tie that together#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm changing the, like the towel racks and stuff, the, the fixtures out to make them wood,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm going to put wood in there.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that should be nice.#Appreciation
So it's going to have kind of a country look.#Summarize/reformulate
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Um, and I haven't even decided as far as, um, what kind of paint to buy.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't have an actual instruction book#Statement-non-opinion
so I'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, uh.#Uninterpretable
Um, it's going to be a big experiment.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was about to say, you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing#Action-directive
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Because you might find that it's beyond, uh, what you're willing to put into it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Although I think it could turn out really nice.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I've,#Uninterpretable
I haven't ever done fancy painting#Statement-non-opinion
but I sure did my share of just regular painting.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I've painted several houses, inside.#Statement-non-opinion
No-,#Reject
I,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
inside.#Repeat-phrase
never painted the outside.#Other
What, what kind of, what kind of paint do you normally use?#Wh-Question
Well, uh, we used a latex, uh, wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork#Statement-non-opinion
and my job was mostly the woodwork.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
uh-huh.#Uninterpretable
My husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers#Statement-non-opinion
and I got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine, uh, trim work,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where I'd use a small brush and, uh, try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well we only have on-, only one of our bathroom has a window in it#Statement-non-opinion
so I'm hoping that, um, it won't be too much of a, a problem.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first. Because I, I think,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well I was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it.#Or-Clause
No,#No answers
I'm, I'm planning on taking it off.#Statement-non-opinion
I have heard that they've got these steamers you can rent now, which make it much easier to get wallpaper off.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago, oh, with a just a scraper and wet sponge#Statement-non-opinion
and it took forever.#Statement-non-opinion
I would not recommend that method.#Action-directive
Okay.#Agree/Accept
Uh, if#Statement-opinion
Well that's something that, that's worthwhile checking into then. 'Cause I,#Statement-opinion
if you can rent a steamer, if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble.#Other
If it's really old, you don't know what it's put on with.#Statement-opinion
It, it's hard to tell,#Statement-non-opinion
it's,#Uninterpretable
the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I know the house, um, was built around the mid fifties.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it may be the original wallpaper#Statement-non-opinion
Could be,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Um, if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too.#Statement-opinion
If it's paper it will probably shred.#Statement-opinion
Um, in one bathroom it's, um, it's probably paper, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it's silver, silver and yellow,#Statement-non-opinion
Um, uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and white.#Other
Well the wallpaper that I was trying to remove was black,#Statement-non-opinion
i-, this was in a bathroom too.#Statement-non-opinion
And the, the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white#Statement-non-opinion
and the, the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background#Statement-non-opinion
and then it had vivid, uh, almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise, and lime green and silver, and, uh, a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that#Statement-non-opinion
Um, that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom.#Appreciation
Oh it was awful,#Statement-non-opinion
it was absolutely hideous#Statement-non-opinion
and, and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it#Statement-non-opinion
and a, a guest went in there#Statement-non-opinion
and he said it's a good thing I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had something to drink and went in there I would think I was having hallucinations#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I, I've also been thinking about, after looking at all these magazines, um, these design magazines and stuff, I'm thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too, in a color that will kind of, um, tie in our, um, our, um, our, uh, comforter,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with a color that's kind of a, um, burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, and I'm not really quite sure,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if maybe I'm biting off more than I can chew.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well I'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes#Action-directive
and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale.#Action-directive
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting.#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Agree/Accept
It wouldn't be any kind of special, um, special effects type thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It would be just plain paint.#Statement-non-opinion
Well it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time.#Statement-opinion
Because if you, uh, use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out, uh, all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto, you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it#Action-directive
and it can be done a whole lot faster.#Statement-opinion
Um, okay.#Agree/Accept
And with rollers and, uh, modern latex paints,#Other
you can wash up easily because they're water soluble.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they dry fast#Statement-opinion
so you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend. If you have some help.#Statement-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then if that, if you discover the little tricks and tips about, you know, how you get through corners and how you do trim and, uh, how long to leave the masking tape down, because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when it, when you pull it up.#Statement-opinion
It, it peels the paint off when you take it off,#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Well, not,#Uninterpretable
i-, if you leave it on for weeks, it will do that.#Statement-opinion
If you take it up the next day it should be fine.#Statement-opinion
You want it to get dry, but not, uh, just real hard.#Action-directive
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
okay.#Agree/Accept
You don't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried to hard.#Action-directive
That's the problem.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It will come up a lot easier if you don't wait too long.#Statement-opinion
And I've, I was told,#Uninterpretable
I always used the nice wide masking tape,#Statement-non-opinion
but I've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because it, it rips as you pull it off for one thing#Other
and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the whole point of using it is to save yourself work.#Statement-opinion
You can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape.#Statement-opinion
But use, use good, uh, stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands,#Action-directive
Okay.#Agree/Accept
that will go down and come up easily.#Other
Well I really appreciate all the helpful tips,#Thanking
I think you are, just made my project a lot easier#Statement-opinion
Well I wish you very good luck with it#Other
and I will tell you that I have retired from the painting business.#Statement-non-opinion
The last time I had something done was my kitchen cabinets#Statement-non-opinion
and I decided that was too much to tackle,#Statement-non-opinion
I'd hire a professional.#Statement-non-opinion
If you were, if you were closer I'd, I'd, I'd tell you you could come over and supervise#Action-directive
Well if I were closer I might.#Agree/Accept
Oh, well I hope your project turns out great#Statement-non-opinion
and I, really think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting.#Statement-opinion
I think that could give it a really a,#Statement-opinion
Well, we'll see how it goes,#Statement-opinion
I may just be flat painting over it.#Statement-opinion
Well, of course that's the other advantage of paint.#Statement-opinion
If you don't like it all you do is put on another coat.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess we'd better go because our time looks like it's about up.#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
I, I need to go to the dentist,#Conventional-closing
so.#Uninterpretable
Okay,#Conventional-closing
bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
It's was nice talking to you Kathleen.#Conventional-closing
Thank you.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

I guess we're going to discuss food and cooking.#Statement-non-opinion
Alright#Agree/Accept
Do you enjoy cooking?#Yes-No-Question
Sometimes,#Affirmative non-yes answers
.#Non-verbal
not all the time#Other
I'm kind of that way, too.#Statement-non-opinion
When I have, I, I enjoy cooking when I have time.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that, that's about the same boat I'm in, too.#Statement-non-opinion
It gets kind of boring.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How big is the family you cook for?#Wh-Question
Uh, five.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We have four,#Statement-non-opinion
so, and two of them are teenage boys,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Oh, well I'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys, too.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Are they?#Backchannel in question form
And they get pretty particular sometimes in#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what they want to have.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we have that problem too.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
But also, now it's just the amount that they eat.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
It's just absolutely incredible#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah,#Agree/Accept
well see, I, m-, my oldest is nine#Statement-non-opinion
and he already#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he already does that#Other
Does he?#Backchannel in question form
And I told him#Statement-non-opinion
.#Uninterpretable
he's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so he can eat.#Other
That's true.#Agree/Accept
Uh, do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal?#Yes-No-Question
Um,#Uninterpretable
Favorite recipes that you've come across or,#Other
My husband and I, our favorite meal is, uh,#Statement-non-opinion

like for special stuff#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
celebrations and, we have like steak#Other

And it's real good.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh,#Statement-non-opinion

and asparagus.#Statement-non-opinion
And that's our favorite,#Statement-non-opinion
Ooh, that's sound good.#Appreciation
dinner.#Other
I love that.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband really likes seafood.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
so do we#Statement-non-opinion
Um, and, I think that no matter what I do, I don't serve enough of it, really, to, uh, to suit him.#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't grow up eating that much seafood#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, so I don't know,#Hedge
it's just kind of not natural to me#Statement-non-opinion
but I like it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
one of his favorite things is, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
well it's called seafood stew#Statement-non-opinion
and it's really, it's really like a s-, soup that, that you serve over rice.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it.#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Uninterpretable
It's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it, is it?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
no.#No answers
That's kind of Louisiana I think#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know what that,#Statement-non-opinion
if you do that.#Other
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
I don't see how you eat that,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Uninterpretable
I don't either#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
no#Other
this is just re-, it is really good#Statement-non-opinion
and, and one thing that's good is it makes the, a large amount.#Statement-non-opinion
And so I've, usually we eat one#Statement-non-opinion
and I freeze two containers of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice.#Statement-non-opinion
But neither of my kids will eat it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Other
so then#Statement-non-opinion
So it,#Uninterpretable
they eat a pizza or#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it defeats the purpose.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it really does.#Statement-non-opinion
One thing I've run across, recently though,#Statement-non-opinion
a friend gave me a recipe that I really like for chicken enchiladas.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah.#Appreciation
Have you made them?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
My husband makes those.#Statement-non-opinion
Does he, ooh.#Backchannel in question form

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I don't like enchila-, I don't like the tex-,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
I guess it's the texture, or something.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't like the taste of enchiladas.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But everyone else in my family does.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, are, these are done with a flour tortilla.#Statement-non-opinion
Is that what he uses?#Yes-No-Question

I don't know,#Hedge
I, it's, I don't know what,#Statement-non-opinion

I, I don't know what it is about the enchiladas.#Statement-non-opinion
I just,#Uninterpretable
and I'm the only one including my Mom and Dad and my brother.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm the only one that#Statement-non-opinion
Isn't that something?#Backchannel in question form
doesn't eat it#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, my kids love it.#Statement-non-opinion
I was going to say, my kids both eat it.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess that's one thing that I particularly like, um.#Statement-non-opinion
But I think it's good for, you know, for, for company, too,#Statement-non-opinion
and I've made it a few times.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, and you can make a lot at one time#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

You know, like,#Other

I've got a chicken casserole that's like that, that, that I've,#Statement-non-opinion
It, it's nice when it makes,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
a lot because you can feed your own family#Other
and then,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
because I, when I make this chicken casserole I, it, it makes a real big casserole and then another one that I freeze.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, or I give it to my Mom and Dad if I know we're not#Statement-non-opinion
What,#Wh-Question
going to eat,#Other
what does it have in it?#Other
It's jus-,#Uninterpretable
you can use chicken or turkey,#Statement-non-opinion
because#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
my Mom started making it like right after Thanksgiving#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and using the leftover turkey.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's rice and, ,#Statement-non-opinion
when I do recipes I just throw stuff in.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't, I'm not real good about measuring#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I just,#Uninterpretable
I do it to taste.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
Sometimes those are the best ones,#Statement-opinion
Well yeah,#Agree/Accept
but it, it's like, it's just chicken,#Statement-non-opinion
it, it's, as much as you want, you know torn up#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and rice and cream of chicken soup#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and some mayonnaise and lemon juice#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and celery#Other
and that's it, and some hard-boiled eggs.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Ooh, that sounds good.#Appreciation
And that's it.#Statement-non-opinion
You just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to, you know, heat it through.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you sprinkle, uh, that, those, uh, toasted onion rings.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Appreciation
Those are good aren't they?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
On top of it for the crunchy.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's it, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
And it, it, it goes#Statement-non-opinion
That sounds good.#Appreciation
and it's filling because of the rice.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
You cook the rice before you put it in?#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really, kind of gives it a#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it gives it a, an extra#Statement-non-opinion
tang that would be good.#Other
yeah, little tang.#Other
I guess I would now use the, the new mayonnaise free.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
that cholesterol fat free?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
That's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
new things like that because like I told my husband this summer, I love to eat, you know, chicken salad and tuna salad#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and stuff like that#Other
and, and, you know, basically it certainly a l-, low calorie, you know, good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing.#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
You know and now it's, it's, it's okay#Statement-opinion
and you can even,#Statement-opinion
I used to just put a tiny bit in.#Statement-non-opinion
Well now, I'm just putting more and more in#Statement-non-opinion
I don't like tuna salad unless it's got lots of mayonnaise in it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and it's only, it used to be like a hun-, hundred calories per tablespoon#Statement-non-opinion
and now it's like twelve.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh!#Appreciation
I know.#Other
I just think that's the best thing to have happened,#Statement-opinion
I'm just so excited about that.#Statement-non-opinion
Anyway#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we did the low-cal stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Well with my kids I don't,#Statement-non-opinion
they get enough sugar and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Other
stuff anyway.#Other
Mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they don't need any added help.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, when we're here at home, you know, with sweets and stuff, they, they don't, we don't really do that much.#Statement-non-opinion
I do a lot of fruits#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
instead of the cakes and the candies and#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, stuff like that.#Other
And, and drink wise they have Kool-Aid, milk or water.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Normally.#Other
Now when they go to their grandmother's house,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
which is every weekend. It's a, it's a different#Other
That's when they,#Summarize/reformulate
a different story all around.#Other
As our family would say, a pig out#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
That's good.#Appreciation
That's exactly what it is.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, one of my boys that, that's, twelve, um, is, has high cholesterol.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really?#Backchannel in question form
Have you ever found out#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
about your kids.#Other
not yet.#No answers
Um, and my other one does not.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
So, oh, year or so ago he found out#Statement-non-opinion
and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down. And did!#Statement-non-opinion
He was able to get it down.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, I think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
things in cholesterol.#Other
He's never eaten any eggs.#Statement-non-opinion
He's never had anything but skim milk#Statement-non-opinion
and you know, I've never bought butter#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
and things like that.#Other
But, um, oh, he just left for the doctor again#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, it's kind of back up.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, so he needs to be careful again.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So we've really been talking about the foods, you know, for him to, to be sure to eat#Statement-non-opinion
The lower cholesterol foods and stuff#Summarize/reformulate
and, uh, so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And all that kind of stuff does really help.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I think we've probably talked long enough#Statement-opinion
and#Uninterpretable

Okay,#Other
go ahead.#Action-directive
Well, I, I, uh, we're going to compare notes. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, uh, I#Statement-non-opinion
Don't do it#Collaborative Completion
often desire to exercise, often believe I should and rarely do.#Other
Well, I tell you, I, I firmly believe in exercising.#Statement-non-opinion
I think it's a,#Statement-opinion
I do it every day on a regular basis.#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
What, what, what sort of, of regiment do you have?#Wh-Question
Well, I just got back from biking twelve and a half miles,#Statement-non-opinion
but this time of year, you can't get much biking in. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
but every morning I use this President's, uh, council of physical fitness#Statement-non-opinion
and it really is, uh, uh, it's worth doing,#Statement-opinion
and you can do it anywhere.#Statement-opinion
I, I travel quite a bit in my#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in my business,#Other
and you can do it, you know, wherever you're at#Statement-opinion
and if you do it,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I do it every morning#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
after, uh, usually after breakfast before I take a shower and get, you know, dressed going#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, to go to work.#Other
And, uh, now what I do,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I've done this for, you know, like fifteen years,#Statement-non-opinion
so you don't start at this kind of regiment, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
so, what I'm telling you isn't something you go out and do#Statement-non-opinion
and, and you'll hurt yourself Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
every, every, uh,#Uninterpretable
it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because I do it all the time,#Statement-non-opinion
but I, uh, I do twenty-five, uh, uh, where you have your arms above your head and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and your body twisters touch right, you know, left and right toe#Other
and I do, uh, ten, uh, right and left, uh, trunk twisters.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I do, uh, about sixty, uh, bicycle, type, uh, leg thrust type things.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I do, uh, twenty, uh, leg lifters on each side. You know#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when you're p-,#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
laying on the floor.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then I do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, then I do about, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
My goodness,#Appreciation
you do all of this in fifteen minutes?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, yeah,#Yes answers
oh, yeah.#Yes answers
And then, uh, thirty, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
now if you did football, like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, prone type things, where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing,#Statement-non-opinion
and that takes about, really about, maybe about thirteen minutes, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the morning.#Other
Now what, what keeps you doing that.#Wh-Question
I mean, I, I sometimes start little, much less, much more modest efforts,#Statement-non-opinion
but I give up,#Statement-non-opinion
I just find them boring.#Statement-non-opinion
Hard to#Statement-non-opinion
Well, uh,#Uninterpretable
find the time for it on a given day#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Years ago I used to, uh, referee football#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, to stay in condition, I did that, uh, just as a normal#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
basis,#Other
and, uh, uh, I tell you just by doing it, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
well, example, this summer I, I was about fifteen pounds heavier than I wanted to be#Statement-non-opinion
so I, I increased,#Statement-non-opinion
I do three hundred sit ups a day now, but not at that, in the morning,#Statement-non-opinion
I do a hundred then#Statement-non-opinion
and then I do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before I go to bed.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I lost fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, you can eat anything you want, drink anything you want,#Statement-opinion
but you don't, you know,#Uninterpretable
within reason, you know, you can lose weight or maintain your weight#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and your physical being#Other
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I just, you know,#Uninterpretable
you're ready to go at a,#Statement-opinion
I, I, I think it's really important.#Statement-opinion
Well, I, I, whenever I do it, I feel good.#Statement-non-opinion
Good.#Appreciation
I mean good that I have done, good because it's, it seems right and good because it has good effects.#Other
.#Non-verbal
But, but it's this maintaining a, a regular habit that I just can't#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's why#Statement-opinion
seem to do.#Other
Chuck, I think, uh, if you did it on a daily basis#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you didn't need elaborate things, you know, where you can make excuses like,#Other
well, I, I like biking#Statement-non-opinion
and during the summer, I'll do, you know, at least seventy-five miles a week#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and when I really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty,#Other
but#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you can't, you know,#Other
there's excuses, weather#Statement-non-opinion
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or you don't have time or something like that.#Statement-opinion
But if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning, just like brushing your teeth you're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you get up a half hour earlier#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and once you start getting into that, one, you just feel good#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you look a whole lot better.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you, do you does your wife participate in any of this#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Unfortunately not,#Negative non-no answers
and there's no way I can get her to.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's a, like it's something you either just really want to do it#Statement-opinion
or you can't talk anyone into it.#Statement-opinion
If you don't like to exercise, you know, it isn't going to happen.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes.#Agree/Accept
I, I sure wish she would.#Statement-non-opinion
She's, you know, unfortunately overweight,#Statement-non-opinion
and, but she's a wonderful woman#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, no sense getting in arguments with anybody, about it.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I, I, uh, I keep saying if somebody else would do it with me, I, that would be, little bit of peer pressure would help considerably.#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
But you seemed to have s-, solved that problem without any, any external#Statement-opinion
No problem at all.#Agree/Accept
help.#Other
And, uh, if you get one of these mats.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, go to a store, they normally have these exercise, things, these A B C -s of physical fitness on them.#Other
One of my kids got me one of those for Christmas one year#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
What, what, what, what's on, what's this mat, I mean,#Wh-Question
It, it, it's just an exercise mat that rolls up#Statement-non-opinion
so you can put it up, you know, just in the corner.#Statement-non-opinion
Is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip#Yes-No-Question
Well, yeah,#Yes answers
you can do that.#Statement-non-opinion
and sleep on it.#Other
I mean, it's that, it's that kind of like#Declarative Yes-No-Question
But, but it doesn't,#Statement-non-opinion
half inch of foam or something.#Other
Yeah,#Yes answers
it's a foam thing,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Yes answers
Yeah.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
and it's, it's just about six feet long, rolls up#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I don't take it on trips with me.#Statement-non-opinion
I, you could,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I don't mind, uh, you know,#Uninterpretable
if I do like sit ups, I'll throw a, a towel down or something.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Other
so you don't have the abrasive,#Statement-non-opinion

How big is Provo?#Wh-Question
Um.#Uninterpretable
That a little town or, or a bigger city?#Yes-No-Question
Um, it's not one of the bigger ones. It's probably, um, I compare it to the size of Plano, maybe a little smaller.#Statement-non-opinion
Plano, Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town, I think.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really? *#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
I forgot the name of the town.#Statement-non-opinion
I thought maybe it was you#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No *#Other
Oh, well, anyway, we're supposed to talk about education.#Statement-non-opinion
I certainly have some ideas since I'm studying it now in college.#Statement-non-opinion
I'd say, first of all, they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading, writing, arithmetic#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in grade school,#Other
because they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to,#Statement-opinion
and it shows up.#Statement-opinion
That's one idea.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you have any?#Yes-No-Question
Um, I don't know,#Other answers
I'm pretty, I think I'm pretty satisfied with, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I gre-, I grew up in Plano#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and my dad is actually on the school board there,#Statement-non-opinion
so, I kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's#Uninterpretable
Plano, uh, improved greatly in the last twenty, twenty-five years#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's for sure.#Statement-opinion
It used to be the pits.#Statement-non-opinion
And Arlington is excellent now,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm just speaking overall#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
across the country.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Something is definitely wrong.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, one thing, they don't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing,#Statement-opinion
so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year#Statement-opinion
and they truly can't read#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I don't know how they expect them to, uh, pass history when they can't read anything, you know, even read a word problem in math.#Statement-non-opinion
So, um, that's definitely a problem.#Statement-opinion
Another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um,#Uninterpretable
So do you, what do you think is good about the schools?#Wh-Question
That is good about,#Uninterpretable
well, it depends on where you are.#Statement-opinion
They're all so different.#Statement-opinion
That's another thing#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
about the United States.#Other
There's no national curriculum, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, what they'd be teaching in an Arlington school they may not be teaching in a Plano school#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and in the same school district, you may, even in an Arlington seventh grade for instance, you may have an English class#Statement-non-opinion
you may have half literature for the whole year,#Statement-non-opinion
whereas in another one they're going to concentrate on grammar#Statement-non-opinion
Grammar.#Repeat-phrase
and give you a little literature,#Other
it's up to the teacher, in other words.#Statement-opinion
So that's kind of o-, you know, that's kind of odd to me.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It depends on, uh, what school you're in and who your teacher is, actually#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or is how you end up#Statement-opinion
Overall, Arlington is good, one of the better ones in the state,#Statement-non-opinion
so I guess we lucked out when we moved here.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum?#Yes-No-Question
I don't know.#Other answers
I just read about that the other day,#Statement-non-opinion
and I had never even thought of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Actually it makes sense to a certain extent,#Statement-opinion
because sometimes, like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didn't even learn what, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and according to her plan,#Other
so I guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh. We actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's, that's pretty low that there's#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
forty-eight countries ahead of us that have more peop-, more citizens percentage wise that can read and write,#Other
so, um, unless we want to keep paying, paying for these people that can't make it in society, we're going to have to do something.#Statement-opinion
Who do you think it should be done through? *#Other
I don't know.#Statement-non-opinion
Obviously nobody's smart enough to have figured it out yet,#Statement-opinion
so I probably can't#Statement-opinion
*#Other
But I do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five, six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh. *#Other
because they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
Uh, you can't, you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had to get a message or something you know, or fill out an application to work at McDonalds if you can't read.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, I think that's, that's a start at least, going back to the basics in the early grades#Statement-opinion
Yes. *#Agree/Accept
and, um, they say that the average English student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's a big jump.#Statement-opinion
Yeah *#Other
I believe that#Agree/Accept
Did you go to school in Plano?#Yes-No-Question
I did.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Through high school.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh,#Yes answers
uh, kinder-,#Uninterpretable

Okay. Well, what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody?#Wh-Question
I think they should.#Statement-opinion
I know I had a job until, let's see, a year ago this past December.#Statement-non-opinion
I was working for P I E#Statement-non-opinion
and they closed,#Statement-non-opinion
and naturally while I was working for them I had health insurance,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, for me to try to get it now, it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at, at P I E.#Statement-non-opinion
Good grief.#Appreciation
That's just almost unaffordable, isn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Right,#Affirmative non-yes answers
it really is,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think, you know, I think, uh,#Uninterpretable
God, the government should come up with some kind of a health plan, or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high.#Statement-opinion
Well, I wonder if they couldn't just provide, uh, interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that.#Statement-non-opinion
That might be a step in the right direction.#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
Well, the thing is, you know, jobs are so hard to find#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
and then,#Other
.#Non-verbal
what you can get out here, in,#Other
anyhow in the valley where I live at now, they don't want to pay anything for health insurance at all.#Statement-non-opinion
No benefits, you know. Um.#Statement-non-opinion
You mean the, uh, the employers?#Signal-non-understanding
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you get a job now, and the wages are really low#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh.#Uninterpretable
Because everybody's competing for jobs.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and they don't want, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to pay any benefits,#Other
so you just, you know, pray to God that you don't get sick.#Statement-opinion
Well, I used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do.#Statement-opinion
I, I have to think about it some more now, because my doctor is, uh, actually he's Canadian#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, he told me that there're a lot of, uh, lot of counts against the Canadian system, which is basically the one people are talking about for here.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't understand the arguments, exactly.#Statement-non-opinion
He says it restricts your choice of doctors, and, and so forth.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not quite sure I understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
I don't understand#Statement-non-opinion
I mean#Statement-non-opinion
that either.#Other
we're on a private insurance plan right now, uh#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
actually I have my own business,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we,#Other
our health insurance is through my wife's employer,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, and every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to, and where we can buy our medicine,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it changes every year#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's always so confusing.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Well, I know the plan that I had with P I E, I could go to any doctor#Statement-non-opinion
and I could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
then I just sent cards in#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Well, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that, you know.#Other
Of course, the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the, uh, the limits#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of, uh, compensation,#Other
but of course that is restricted choice,#Statement-opinion
so#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't think that the restricted choice really, uh, has to do with the difference between, uh, public and private health insurance.#Other
I think it has to do with the, the, the, uh, attempt to limit cost, doesn't it#Statement-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way,#Statement-opinion
so.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true,#Agree/Accept
that's true there.#Agree/Accept
Well, um#Other
Well.#Uninterpretable
I guess the most sensible thing I've heard about this is they say people are trying.#Other
You, you have to recognize that if you're going to have the very best health care possible and, uh, available on demand whenever and wherever you want it, then it's going to be expensive.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
And if you want to pay less, then you're going to have to settle for a health system that is not quite that, uh, lavish.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh.#Uninterpretable
But there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything, you know,#Statement-opinion

and the people don't want to hire people this age any more.#Statement-non-opinion
And I worked for my previous company for twenty-six years, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
so, it's kind of hard, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable

they'll be calling at my door, huh.#Statement-opinion
But anyhow.#Uninterpretable
Well, if they're smart.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now I, I do think the government, though, is going to have to do something, uh, with this problem, because, it, you know, even to go to a little doctor out here, just to ask him anything, costs you forty bucks#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, just for the visit.#Other
And then he,#Uninterpretable
then that's not counting what medicine you're going to buy and everything else, you know.#Statement-opinion
And he might tell you, well, you know, now you're going to have to come back in a week,#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then that's another forty bucks, plus whatever else he decides to do to you,#Other

You know, cause they know we are in the building and coming.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Where as, at, uh, another place, you are paying a lot more money#Other
and, uh, it does going to start whether you are there or not#Statement-opinion
That is right#Agree/Accept
That is right.#Agree/Accept
So this has worked out real nicely.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, she charges us two dollars a session.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that is not much.#Appreciation
Huh-uh.#Agree/Accept
So it's, it's,#Uninterpretable
we like pay her for six weeks at a time#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
cause that is like a unit in, uh, uh, school#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, report card period#Other
and so it is like twenty-four dollars every six weeks.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That is not bad.#Appreciation
Huh-uh.#Agree/Accept
It beats memberships at some of these clubs.#Appreciation
That is for sure.#Appreciation
You are not kidding.#Appreciation
They are real expensive.#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
We belonged, uh, for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and at first we used it#Statement-non-opinion
and then it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they offered lots of things,#Statement-non-opinion
but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So we decided to forget that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That was just a waste of our our money.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well we have one through work#Statement-non-opinion
and its, its probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year. Which is bad. *#Statement-non-opinion
Oh no.#Appreciation
But, I, uh, I don't know#Statement-non-opinion
I still just don't don't end up going cause it isn't at a convenient time or I don't know something,#Statement-non-opinion
but I need to do something.#Statement-non-opinion
If, if its only walk the dog or something.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I need to start doing that.#Statement-non-opinion
It does make you feel better.#Statement-opinion
The hard thing is getting going.#Statement-opinion
That is right.#Agree/Accept
And if you have somebody who will do it with you,#Statement-opinion
like, for a long time my husband didn't want to walk cause he wants to, uh, jog#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but he decided that, uh, maybe, uh, you know,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay, Lowell,#Other
so I'd like to know, um, what, what do you do in lawn and garden,#Wh-Question
what, uh, what's, what's of interest to you#Wh-Question
and how do you go about it?#Wh-Question
Well, I have a town home,#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't do a lot of regular maintenance,#Statement-non-opinion
but I do have a large garden out in back,#Statement-non-opinion
so we do a lot of things with perennials and, uh, also a few annual plants, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and then every year I grow a garden.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you do, you do actually, uh, grow a garden to produce food?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So how much room do you have?#Wh-Question
Um, we have virtually no room out in front,#Statement-non-opinion
and then in the back I'd say we have about an eighth of an acre#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we pretty much fill it up with, uh, like I said, perennials, things that aren't, don't have to fool with every year,#Statement-non-opinion
but then I've got, uh, a twenty-five by twenty area that I do gardening, as far as, you know, tomatoes and cucumbers and beans#Statement-non-opinion
and.#Uninterpretable
Oh, that's what I was curious about,#Response Acknowledgement
I was wondering whether you had actually some of the flowers that you had planted were bulb type that you would dig up and, and then put down your garden and then put them back in later, or something like that.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
So you.#Uninterpretable
No,#No answers
we have a separate area for the garden.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you do have a separate area.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and last year was the first year we tried two new things.#Statement-non-opinion
We tried corn,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we tried a watermelon.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, tell me this, uh, Lowell,#Action-directive
do you en-, do you enjoy doing that kind of work,#Yes-No-Question
and#Yes-No-Question
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
do you have the time to relax so that you can take advantage of it?#Other
I enjoy doing it on a limited basis.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I don't think that if I,#Uninterpretable
the reason I bought a townhouse is so that I wouldn't,#Statement-non-opinion
I get,#Uninterpretable
I'm allergic to grass.#Statement-non-opinion
So I don't mow grass or anything like that.#Statement-non-opinion
So I think if I had a big home and a big lawn I'd, I don't believe I would enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
But just on the limited basis that I do it, I do enjoy it very much.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I'm a little more fortunate I think from that point of view.#Statement-opinion
I'm not allergic to things,#Statement-non-opinion
and I moved here in State College quite a while ago and was fortunate to get some land.#Statement-non-opinion
So, actually I have nine acres#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
And, uh, for many years I grew sweet corn,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, and, and my kids were there,#Statement-non-opinion
and so we set up a shop there,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I would, uh, collect the corn very carefully, ear by ear,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was never more than one to two hours old,#Statement-non-opinion
and people came from miles and miles around to get that corn, because they knew it was individually picked and very, very fresh.#Statement-non-opinion
How about that.#Appreciation
So we had a nice thing going there,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was delicious.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh, I really enjoyed that,#Statement-non-opinion
and then I also have a, a garden.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, it's probably, uh, twenty-five by thirty or forty, something like that, that I put in my normal food garden things each year,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I have a little bit of everything, or a whole lot of everything in the#Statement-non-opinion
actually. I love, uh, broccoli, brussels sprouts,#Statement-non-opinion
and I have all kinds of tomatoes, kale, and all those good things,#Statement-non-opinion
and I rent out my field that I used to plant in sweet corn to a local farmer,#Statement-non-opinion
and then he plants about a quarter of an acre of sweet corn for me to use,#Statement-non-opinion
so I get out of that amount of work at any rate.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's nice.#Appreciation
It is, it is very, very nice.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I really enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
My problem is not having enough time to do the job as completely and as thoroughly as I would like.#Statement-non-opinion
I enjoy it very much.#Statement-non-opinion
That much land requires an awful lot of time.#Summarize/reformulate
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it does.#Agree/Accept
Uh, and actually I had a pony there for twenty-five years,#Statement-non-opinion
and he had two acres that he had for his own grazing#Statement-non-opinion
How about that.#Appreciation
So he had his own backyard garden, too.#Statement-non-opinion
But that, that worked out very nicely too.#Statement-non-opinion
I built him a barn back there where, in the part of my corn field,#Statement-non-opinion
and he lived in that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, as far as gardening is concerned, we do enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
My wife is in charge of the flowers.#Statement-non-opinion
She does all of the flower gardening throughout the whole property,#Statement-non-opinion
and we have, you know, an acre, an acre and a half that the house is sitting in the middle of,#Statement-non-opinion
and she has flower gardens and bulbs, perennials and things.#Statement-non-opinion
We have blueberries, blackberries.#Statement-non-opinion
I have two or three, uh, apple trees,#Statement-non-opinion
the Golden Delicious were fantastic this year.#Statement-non-opinion
My neighbor has pear trees, and, um, oh, blueberries, all kinds of food around there, if we just had time to take advantage of it.#Statement-non-opinion
My wife has spent probably I don't know how many hours in the last two or three weeks canning pears, because there were so many of them,#Statement-non-opinion
and I have been totally engulfed with Golden Delicious apples.#Statement-non-opinion
I just couldn't handle the, the amount of them we got this year.#Statement-non-opinion
It's really been a remarkable year.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I bet you could answer a question for me.#Statement-opinion
What's a good apple to bake pies with?#Wh-Question
I use my Golden Delicious,#Statement-non-opinion
and they make delicious pies.#Statement-non-opinion
Are there m- 'n#Yes-No-Question
there's an afflu-#Uninterpretable

I guess I don-, don't really have a problem with capital punishment.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not really sure what the exact, uh, specifications are for Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
I know that they, uh, have capital punishment for certain crimes,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's probably the way I feel about it is, is, uh, it kind of depends on the crime that's committed.#Statement-opinion
My belief all my life, I guess, has been that, that if you take someone else's life, then you automatically are giving up, uh, yours in place of it#Statement-opinion
But I don't,#Uninterpretable
seems to be a lot of controversy about that#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Uh, uh, I tend to agree with you, uh, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
probably pretty similar views on it,#Statement-opinion
but that's, that's one of the things I don't, don't understand is, is so much of the controversy#Statement-non-opinion
because, uh, you know, I, I do also, myself, believe in capital punishment, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, you know, it, it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the State when they so callously and usually so, you know, without even thinking or without any concern, uh, you know, end somebody else's life, and in a lot of cases several people's lives.#Statement-non-opinion
That's true#Agree/Accept
I guess, well, there's, there's probably two or three different types of, of views as far as the controversy goes.#Statement-opinion
I can see where if a life was taken by accident or, uh, I don't know what you'd call it, not premeditated or, I guess primarily by accident, uh, there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for,#Statement-opinion
but I lean towards,#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if it's premeditated or if it's, uh, kind of a habitual or, or a habit that, uh, a tendency that people, uh, may get into, then I guess I don't really have a problem with it#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's, that's kind of the way I feel.#Statement-non-opinion
If, if you've got a guy who's, who's been to trial and has been in and out of jail, you know, basically a, a three time loser for the twelfth time, you know, and he goes out and kills somebody, he's not going to be reformed,#Statement-opinion
he's not going to get any better, you know,#Statement-opinion
it's, it's not going to, it's just not going to get any better.#Statement-opinion
And, and the only thing, you know,#Uninterpretable
a lot of people have the opinion that, you know, don't, don't have capital punishment,#Statement-opinion
but give them life in jail#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, I could go along with that, if, if I could be assured that it would be their natural life in jail and not parole after ten,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or twelve years.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's what aggravates a lot of people, is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty,#Statement-opinion
and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
it's, it's just our criminal system is just so, I guess, overloaded,#Statement-opinion
but the, you know, the, the problem is not so much with the prison system, you know,#Statement-opinion
I mean, because the, the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws,#Statement-non-opinion
and the prison system are just, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
they're trying to cope with them,#Statement-non-opinion
but you know, the thing about capital punishment i-, I, you know,#Uninterpretable
a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent, uh, to, to future crime,#Statement-opinion
and the way it is now, it's not.#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
Because, you know, you,#Uninterpretable
if like#Uninterpretable
the State of Texas, for example, may, uh, you know, may execute somebody twice a year.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, that's, that's no kind of deterrent because we, we've got literally hundreds of people on death row, and, and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on death row,#Other
and that's, that's certainly no kind of deterrent,#Statement-opinion
and I would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it, it's not a terrent, a deterrent, because it's not.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
it's not.#Agree/Accept
You think of your chances of getting the death penalty after cre-, uh, committing a crime are really pretty slim right now.#Statement-opinion
And you can,#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
probably spend, uh, a lot of time, uh, or maybe eventually, uh, just waiting it out,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's where a lot of aggravation comes, I think, is, is, uh, these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they may spend years,#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, the last I heard it was costing ten, twenty, thirty thousand dollars a year, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to keep these guys waiting.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, it's amazing.#Statement-opinion
There's, uh, there's a girl I work with, our secretary, as a matter of fact,#Statement-non-opinion
her, her father was murdered, her father and three other guys up here in Sherman.#Statement-non-opinion
And the, uh, the guy, that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death, you know, he's been on death row for like eight years.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, this, this was her father, uh, you know, that, that got killed, you know, just cold-blooded murder, him and three other people,#Statement-non-opinion
and, but still, for some reason, you know, this, this guy's sentence has not been carried out, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
he's sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people,#Statement-non-opinion
and the State still can't bring itself to, to ex-, execute,#Statement-non-opinion
To, yeah, to carry it out.#Collaborative Completion
this guy.#Other
It sort of takes the justice out of the justice system.#Summarize/reformulate
It does,#Agree/Accept
it really does, you know.#Agree/Accept
She, and they have to go back, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
occasionally, you know, she has to write letters to the parole board and, you know, lawyers,#Statement-non-opinion
and just, just ever so often she mentions, well, she's got to do something else, you know, write another letter,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or do something.#Other
It's just,#Uninterpretable
It should be over and done with.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
you know, she should be getting on with her life, you know, getting, getting that part behind her,#Statement-non-opinion
but yet, it's, it's kind of tied to her the way it is now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Agree/Accept
And she winds up being a, a victim,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
day after day after day.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
A victim,#Statement-non-opinion
not only of, indirectly of the crime, but also indirectly by that,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
indirect involvement.#Other
It's just, it's,#Statement-opinion
She,#Summarize/reformulate
it's ridiculous.#Other
She's an emotional victim#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it, it's terrible, you know#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
And, you know, the, like you say, the cops that are out doing the work#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work,#Other
Oh, that,#Uninterpretable
basically go out the window.#Other
oh, man, I, I couldn't be a cop for that, for that very reason, you know, because they do.#Statement-non-opinion
The, the criminal gets right back out#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, the cop's just got to go back and, and do his thing all over again, because so many of the crimes are, are done by repeat offenders.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
they are.#Agree/Accept
It's,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's about five minutes,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Declarative Yes-No-Question

they do.#Statement-non-opinion
They are still babies.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, my children like to watch SESAME STREET.#Statement-non-opinion
I watch with them every once in a while,#Statement-non-opinion
but that is not my favorite programs.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well. We have only get two channels.#Statement-non-opinion
We do not have cable.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I am not crazy about T V much.#Statement-non-opinion
It just,#Uninterpretable
well it kind of is an idiot box.#Statement-opinion
Now SESAME STREET is a good program#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because, uh,#Other
I do have that on videotape,#Statement-non-opinion
and I will let him watch that every once in a while.#Statement-non-opinion
And he has learned to count to twenty from that.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It can be very#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
educational.#Other
There are shows th-, that I like.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I like good family shows,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, though.#Other
Uh, I let my kids watch things like LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the COSBY SHOW is, uh, is, uh, kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that sometimes the things they show on there though, uh,#Statement-opinion
the problems that their kids get into, are, are good to, uh, show that they do have problems anyway.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh,#Uninterpretable
But they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, like I said, real life is not that easy.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I watch a show that I like i-, for entertainment.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, it is called the QUANTUM LEAP.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I love QUANTUM LEAP.#Statement-non-opinion
I watch that show every time,#Statement-non-opinion
Um, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
That is a good show.#Other
I, I like, uh, how the, how he has to help with the people that he, that he becomes.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He has to do something positive to help them.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I,#Uninterpretable
He always got to change history is what it is.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Usually, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It,#Uninterpretable
That it is so good.#Statement-opinion
I was glad when they put that back on this channel,#Statement-non-opinion
Me too,#Statement-non-opinion
me too.#Statement-non-opinion
because like I said, we only get two channels because we do not get cable.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And still my little boy, he watches videotapes.#Statement-non-opinion
He won't, um,#Uninterpretable
this is terrible,#Statement-opinion
I do not like him sitting in front of the T V all day.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Dispreferred answers
that is not terrible.#Statement-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
I do not think that is terrible at all.#Statement-non-opinion
It,#Other
but it is a not really a good baby sitter#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
It is really not.#Statement-opinion
He needs to get outside and play.#Statement-non-opinion
And he is four years old,#Statement-non-opinion
and he just does not like to go out there by himself.#Statement-non-opinion
And I will let him watch the T V when I am wanting to get my house work done.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But other than that, I do not like him glued to the T V all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I do not think it is, it is healthy all the time either.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and my kids like to, to go play with their friends,#Statement-non-opinion
and so I guess I do not mind too much when they do watch a little bit.#Statement-non-opinion
Now I,#Uninterpretable
there are shows,#Statement-non-opinion
I do not have cable either.#Statement-non-opinion
And there are shows that I really put my foot down on.#Statement-non-opinion
If there starts to be a lot of violence,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do not go for that.#Other
I will not let them watch that.#Statement-non-opinion
If#Statement-non-opinion
Well, we made the mis-,#Uninterpretable
there is a lot of language or,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We made the mistake of getting ROBOCOP.#Statement-non-opinion
And that is one of the worst, oh,#Statement-opinion
I do not let him watch it anymore. Because#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the, the pieces, like especially where they kill somebody, it is just not good.#Other
I mean it is just real violent.#Statement-opinion
I mean,#Uninterpretable
Well, it, you know,#Uninterpretable
today I watched,#Statement-non-opinion
and it is like they show bloody,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, things,#Other
and they show it in slow motion.#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and everything like that.#Other
And before, in a western or something, in the, in the olden days,#Statement-opinion
You would see somebody get shot,#Statement-non-opinion
they would just fall down.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they were gone#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and it was not, uh,#Statement-opinion
So graphic.#Collaborative Completion
not like today. Uh,#Other
Today it is, it is really graphic.#Statement-opinion
They try to make#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it too realistic.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
Too much realism I think,#Statement-opinion

All right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

I'm a substitute teacher, in, I believe, the same school system we both work in.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I was just trying to make an introduction, here#Action-directive
Oh, okay.#Agree/Accept
But, oh, and, and I haven't told you I'm going to be at a different school this year, now.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've just gotten a, another job at an elementary library at Barron.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I bet you're, you're, you may dress differently, then, for that.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
well, not really.#Dispreferred answers
I've got the, every day I've got to, uh, read to kindergartners,#Statement-non-opinion
so I'm going to be down on the floor with them.#Statement-non-opinion
I've got about forty kindergartners I'm going to be doing, working with every day for, uh, you know, a half hour.#Statement-non-opinion
So I'll be, I'll probably be wearing slacks as often as I do because I'm, I'm, if I'm going to be down on the floor messing with them, I'm not going to wear nylons and, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Statement-non-opinion
nice nylons and dresses.#Other
What I wear sometimes depends on, on how cold I think the school might be or what room I might be in#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
since I'm a sub, and have different rooms to go to. And always carry a sweater.#Other
Well, of course, you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
But, you don't know, uh, I guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
you try to layer, so you can add or, or#Statement-non-opinion
Subtract.#Collaborative Completion
or take off.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's, it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I think some of the dress codes are different at different schools.#Statement-non-opinion
That's one of things, one of the things I ask about, you know, whether, whether she would allow slacks#Statement-non-opinion
and she said she doesn't have a problem with that,#Statement-non-opinion
she just didn't like sloppy dressing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and I said, well, you know, that was okay.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'm,#Uninterpretable
basically, I just, you know, I wear slacks year round except every, about once a week I try to wear a skirt.#Statement-non-opinion
And, and in the winter, you know, I just add a, maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than I do in the summer. And add a heavier jacket or, you know, wear jackets more in the winter than I do in the summer.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's about,#Uninterpretable
I don't, I don't really work in a profession that requires that I wear a business suit and, you know, look really,#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, well, for me sometimes, they even have dress up days#Statement-non-opinion
or they, you know, have, have spirit week that, that you wear your different outfits#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you have to have the color for that particular school if you, if you choose to participate in#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
spirit week.#Other
And one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some#Statement-non-opinion
And you never know that, though#Yes-No-Question
sort of hat.#Other
sometimes when you're going in, do you?#Other
No,#No answers
but because I sort of stick to several schools, uh, I'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and, and might, might remember to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then many schools on a particular day during, uh, I guess football season, maybe all year long, they wear the school colors for, uh, game day#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which,#Other
On what, Thursd-, Thursday.#Collaborative Completion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it might be Thursday for the high schools#Statement-non-opinion
and it may be Friday for the senior high schools.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that would kind of give you a, a clue, I guess#Statement-non-opinion
and, and sometimes you get the long term stuff#Statement-non-opinion
so you're aware ahead of time#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of what's going on.#Other
That,#Uninterpretable
so that's,#Uninterpretable
and I don't know, you know,#Hedge
I, I think about, well, the dress code they have for the kids, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Are#Uninterpretable
they put one on the parents, or the teachers and say they have to, the men have to wear ties#Statement-non-opinion
and there can be no blue jeans worn#Statement-non-opinion
and, because some of the teachers I know wear, uh, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease#Other
and, uh, you know, they'll wear it with a nice top.#Statement-non-opinion
And, and, uh, I don't know that that looks that bad.#Statement-non-opinion
But, if you're going to tell the kids they c-, have to dress up, I guess you can tell the teachers that, too.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, it,#Uninterpretable
I see that the,#Statement-non-opinion
I think the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, I think.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it, I think it varies, it, it just so much.#Statement-non-opinion
Anything, anything can go.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools, like history at Clark, they're all pretty fancy.#Statement-non-opinion
But they're just sort of into clothes,#Statement-non-opinion
and then there's other departments#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that aren't.#Other
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they'll just wear your common, ordinary, you know, whatever you might#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's a couple#Statement-non-opinion
might say,#Other
teachers up there that, that do dress up more than others.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there,#Statement-non-opinion
you don't want to dress too tacky because you're going to be in the same room with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, and you always,#Uninterpretable
course, it's a standing joke, you know, when the, when the men come in in a, a tie and a suit coat, you say, you know, what, have you got a job interview today#Statement-non-opinion
or,#Statement-non-opinion
Or you're going#Collaborative Completion
there, there's,#Other
to be observed.#Other
There's usually, yeah, there's usually something going on that, that, uh, and would, would, uh, cause that to happen#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I, I don't know how a coach would feel if, that teaches health or Eng-, you know, English, or whatever that they had to wear a tie.#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
some of those male coaches, that might really,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They go around in their little coaching shorts or#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a T-shirt.#Collaborative Completion
parachute pants.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That I didn't ever understand.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well at#Statement-non-opinion
Whether,#Uninterpretable
Vines, the coaches don't do that.#Other
They, they dress pretty good, I would say#Statement-non-opinion
and then they go to their coaching#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they put their shorts#Statement-non-opinion
Change then.#Collaborative Completion
on there.#Other
Well, see, that's what I would think.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's what I would think.#Statement-non-opinion
But, they, they don't look, you know, they don't wear their sweat pants or, or anything.#Statement-non-opinion
They're, they dress like any other teacher would in#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in a classroom situation, not in P E.#Other
Course, we had, had one coach, one period he'd teach P E and the next period Health and then a period of P E#Statement-non-opinion
Those I can understand.#Statement-non-opinion
and, and that's hard.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, so he just left warm-ups on,#Statement-non-opinion
but, but, uh, no,#Uninterpretable
I think, really probably, they could, they could, uh, really,#Statement-opinion
and I don't know if, if they put, make uniforms the thing for the kids,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
I don't think we'll ever get to that.#Statement-non-opinion
You don't think so.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No,#No answers
I don't think.#Statement-non-opinion
I think we're going the opposite direction.#Statement-non-opinion
It's the parochial schools that I guess many ti-,#Statement-opinion
they've had uniforms for years,#Statement-non-opinion
I r-, don't really know if they still do.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, some of them, yes they do#Statement-non-opinion
and, and it's not#Statement-non-opinion
It certainly makes it easier to dress.#Statement-non-opinion
at some of the private schools,#Other
but even there's a couple public schools in Dallas where, where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers, you know, dress#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in accordance with that.#Other
Well, it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run, I think, that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I, I think it would make a difference at school.#Statement-opinion
I, I don't think we should be spending time saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing sh-, too shorts, too short#Statement-opinion
or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high, you know,#Statement-opinion
I mean#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's a lot of trouble to, to take care of that.#Other
And, of course, the kids say, then why bother, just let me wear what I want.#Statement-non-opinion
And, and yet we can't to that either.#Statement-opinion
I'd like to see them go to, to not necessarily a uniform, but saying that they've got to wear a button down shirt. You know,#Statement-opinion
that would, that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them.#Statement-opinion
But if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I doubt that that would come ab-,#Statement-non-opinion
And then the girls,#Statement-opinion
that that will come about.#Other
Just#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I,#Uninterpretable
I don't,#Uninterpretable
no,#Agree/Accept
not in Plano.#Statement-opinion
No#Agree/Accept
not,#Uninterpretable
They may get a-,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational process there.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I think it does.#Statement-opinion
It, it takes their minds off of, of trying to compete.#Statement-opinion
Highland Park's thinking about going that route.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it,#Uninterpretable
and then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I don't think a lot of teachers are very professional#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree with you on,#Statement-opinion

my brother lives down East of us down there,#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't think they ate all that much different#Statement-non-opinion

you have to ship it a long way to get it#Other

Right,#Agree/Accept
and, and, uh, and, but here, we eat a lot of like Mexican foods,#Statement-non-opinion

So, I,#Uninterpretable

Your, uh, bread family and your,#Statement-non-opinion
or least what it used to be the regular menu was followed and ,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
ham and bake potatoes, uh,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, something from each, each area that you're supposed to choose from.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, we, we, we ourselves are into the wok cooking,#Statement-non-opinion
you know they been advertising that#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we've really been enjoying those, uh, meals.#Other
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
They have a lot of vegetable to them,#Statement-opinion
and, uh,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they really are very good.#Other
Oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
I, I love that kind of cooking.#Statement-non-opinion
My, uh, unfortunately, I am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things#Statement-non-opinion
Is he a meat and potato person?#Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
They.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, all our family is, is gone.#Statement-non-opinion
They are out on their own.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh.#Statement-non-opinion
That probably makes it easier,#Statement-opinion
but.#Uninterpretable
It, it's much different#Other
and, uh.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and of course ,#Other
Well, my husband didn't like that,#Statement-non-opinion
so we, us kids,#Uninterpretable
we had five children#Statement-non-opinion
and we ate that when he, he wasn't going to be home for supper,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's what we had#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, that's pretty much what we do,#Statement-non-opinion
if dad's not coming home, we have macaroni and cheese,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or something.#Other
But, they like, uh, spaghetti.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, that's one meal,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can fix#Other
and the whole family eats.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, there are several things that,#Uninterpretable
well as a matter of fact, I keep chicken nuggets handy all the time, because.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, those always go good.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
the children love them,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, they are real easy to cook#Statement-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that way, whatever meat we have, if they don't like it, well,#Other
and my girls don't like beef,#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Hedge
Oh really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
don't know,#Other
Well maybe.#Statement-opinion
I guess,#Hedge
that's good the way, way the things are going.#Other
Well, yeah,#Agree/Accept
it could be, bec-, they don't,#Uninterpretable
I think it's the texture of it,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it takes more chewing#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that,#Other
and it is easier to chew.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Right.#Agree/Accept
So they're not too much into beef.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My husband and I eat more beef than we should,#Statement-non-opinion
but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We don't really have, uh, you know, entertain too much.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know if you do or not,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
but we, we don't a whole lot,#Statement-non-opinion
we're more, once in a while, but mostly family,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
activities.#Other
Well, most of the entertaining we do is church associated.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We have a real tiny little house,#Statement-non-opinion
we don't have room really,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to have people here.#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, we do get together for wh-, fellowships at our church,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, my husband and I do a lot of the planning in that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
Well that's good.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is#Agree/Accept
and it's fun to, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we do a lot of that take ,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
things to church#Other
and our homemakers meet at the church also,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's what we do mostly,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
most of the time for that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you don't really include any certain food groups,#Statement-non-opinion
you just bring,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what you like#Other
That's right#Agree/Accept
Sometimes you have all desserts,#Statement-non-opinion
sometimes,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you have all vegetables#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's true,#Agree/Accept
that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you, uh, like best.#Other
But, it doesn't happen very often,#Statement-non-opinion
usually you get a pretty wide variety#Statement-non-opinion
and you can, you can ,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
have pretty good meals,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
from one of those.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I remember one time we had a progressive dinner.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, those are fun.#Appreciation
It's the only time that ever.#Uninterpretable
Yeah#Agree/Accept
they are.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it's the only time tha-, I can remember that,#Statement-non-opinion
I can't remember what food it was#Statement-non-opinion
I, it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with.#Statement-non-opinion
Several people were supposed to bring,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, each, like, uh, a, an appetizer,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a main dish and a dessert.#Other
And we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but when we came to the main, main dish plate,#Other
Oh.#Other
there was only like two or three#Other
Was there enough to go around?#Yes-No-Question
Well, not really,#Negative non-no answers
you know we all took real tiny little portions,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, were kind of angry with whoever it was,#Other
we were not sure who didn't show up with the food#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's kind of irresponsible and does upset you, because they are grown adults usually#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
and you know they know better.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Even if they can't do it, they can always maybe get somebody else to cook .#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Either, either go ahead and fix your dish#Statement-opinion
or call someone that can.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Right.#Agree/Accept
I know it.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, that sounds neat,#Appreciation
I can't, uh, believe you're so far away,#Statement-non-opinion
but you sound so close.#Statement-non-opinion
They said that we could share, we share,#Statement-non-opinion
It sounds like you're here in Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
a recipe#Other
but, I'm up at my daughter's,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't even have any of my recipes with me.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you know ,#Uninterpretable
I don't know if I have anything handy,#Statement-non-opinion
we were just about, we were getting ready to go swimming,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we're waiting on my sister.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, great.#Appreciation
Cara, hold on just a second#3rd-party-talk
As a matter of fact, my,#Statement-non-opinion
They are ready to go.#Collaborative Completion
little one is hollering#Other
Well, we probably, have we talked long enough#Conventional-closing
I,#Uninterpretable
I think it probably has been.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
so I'll let,#Uninterpretable
So, I've enjoyed talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Oh, same here.#Conventional-closing
You have a good day.#Conventional-closing
Thank you.#Conventional-closing
Thanks for calling.#Conventional-closing
Uh-huh.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

So, the, the topic is hobbies#Statement-non-opinion
In your spare time.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Who has spare time ?#Rhetorical-Questions
.#Non-verbal
Um, I don't really, don't really do any handicraft things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
I used to. I used to do, like salt ornaments and things.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But that was, oh, good many, many years ago#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have, I really, my spare time#Other
I usually go do aerobics and read,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
about it#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I understood that.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, you know, I work full time#Statement-non-opinion
and I have two kids#Statement-non-opinion
so my spare time usually involves something with the kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, hobbies,#Uninterpretable
we, I, I can't really say that we have hobbies.#Statement-non-opinion
It's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, we like to go out#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
go out,#Other
family.#Uninterpretable
Well, well, that's what I meant by salt that we, we did that like as a family, little ornaments and,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
things like that, and just kind of really got into it. Like during the Christmas season,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
making them up for other people and things like that.#Other
But#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as far as,#Other
I've just never been very skilled at,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
far, you know, needle,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
work cloths.#Other
And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and,#Uninterpretable
I, I guess mostly as far as, as crafts go, I've done, um, some needlepoint.#Statement-non-opinion
I've done mostly cross stitching.#Statement-non-opinion
I used to, uh, do like, um,#Statement-non-opinion
one that I did for both kids are like, oh,#Statement-non-opinion
they're plaques with, you know, different kind of animals#Statement-non-opinion
and then you have their birth date on them,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then you have a little picture of them#Statement-non-opinion
and you frame them and stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but nothing steady.#Statement-non-opinion
Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, it's nothing that I,#Statement-non-opinion
It's not,#Summarize/reformulate
can really,#Other
like you sit and knit every night#Other
No.#Agree/Accept
Not at all.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't even know how to knit#Statement-non-opinion
and my mother used to knit, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
all the time#Other
and, and I don't even know how to knit#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I'm like, that's a lost art from this family#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, um,#Uninterpretable
but, it's not a very good topic#Statement-opinion
it feels like,#Hedge
No.#Agree/Accept
if, you know,#Other
not when you're n-,#Uninterpretable
neither one of us are really,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I have seen things I really like,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, that were done, especially like needlepoint.#Other
Needlepoint,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
cushions and things.#Other
But, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, and, and that the petty point and things like that.#Other
It's like, God, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made#Statement-opinion
I don't know what, what, is,#Statement-non-opinion
it's like there,#Statement-non-opinion
but here a lot of the country stuff is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, uh, stenciling.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff#Statement-non-opinion
and there's just tons of stuff everywhere#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, people just do it in their garage#Other
and then on weekends they go out and sell it#Statement-non-opinion
and during the week they go back and do some more.#Statement-non-opinion
And see, they do that as their job. Whereas,#Summarize/reformulate
Right#Agree/Accept
you know, for us it,#Other
and they make it cheaper for us to buy#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept
Definitely.#Agree/Accept
So,#Uninterpretable
but, and, I mean, I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that#Statement-opinion
because I can remember when I used to do, you know, those little salt, those figurines and things.#Statement-non-opinion
It was, it was relaxing, you know, creative,#Statement-opinion
you felt very creative.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, it just was so time, time,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
involved, you know, so much time involved and the different steps and things.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
and,#Uninterpretable
Okay#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I think, I think we're okay.#Statement-opinion
I think we did the five minutes,#Statement-opinion
so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, thank you.#Thanking

I hadn't seen anything since DANCES WITH WOLVES#Statement-non-opinion
but today I went to see REGARDING WITH HENRY.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I'm dying to see that.#Statement-non-opinion

We#Uninterpretable

Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, Jeff and Deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood,#Statement-non-opinion

We had both moms and, uh, fifteen year olds and a twelve year old#Statement-non-opinion

Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
everyone enjoyed it.#Other
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
Oh, well I am just dying to see it.#Statement-non-opinion
I went to dinner with some friends last weekend#Statement-non-opinion

and we'll all go see REGARDING HENRY#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I said, ooh, I want to see it so bad.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer, on, choir tour and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
visiting friends and one thing and another. A lot of the ones I had wanted to see#Other
and so since he had this friend up from Houston, uh, and his friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this and I thought well, I want to see this one, too.#Statement-non-opinion
So, we, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I#Other
finally, it's my first summer movie#Statement-non-opinion
Oh my.#Appreciation

right before I went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on,#Statement-non-opinion
we're going to the movies.#Quotation
And we won't,#Statement-non-opinion
well she goes all the time#Statement-non-opinion
but I go maybe once every couple of months.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And when I go, I go see two at a time.#Statement-non-opinion
So we went to see SOAPDISH,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Oh, was that good?#Yes-No-Question
Cause,#Uninterpretable
Oh, hysterical.#Statement-opinion
We laughed so hard,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
it was just, you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so hard.#Other
Well, I want to see that and CITY SLICKERS both.#Statement-non-opinion
I love#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
comedies.#Other
But, that's what I was#Statement-non-opinion
that's the other one that we went to that night.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, was it?#Backchannel in question form
And, my face hurt so bad,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
from laughing#Other
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I love Billy Crystal.#Other
And course, growing up on, on the back of a horse, you know, and being on ranches and stuff, so much of that was so true#Statement-opinion
and I was absolutely rolling in the aisles.#Statement-non-opinion
It was so funny.#Statement-opinion
Both of them were great.#Statement-opinion
Oh, well good.#Appreciation
I'm, I'm glad to hear that because they,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, they are, are#Agree/Accept
we just laughed so hard.#Statement-non-opinion
And like I said, with CITY SLICK-, I mean with SOAPDISH, it is so cornball#Statement-opinion
and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
Just, they just carried it off,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to the tee.#Other
Well, I don't, I don't know if you got to see WEEKEND, um, AT BERNIE'S#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
that was out a couple of years ago.#Other
They had a free showing at the Berkeley, um, United Artist.#Statement-non-opinion
How neat.#Appreciation
And, I don't know who was here or whether Jay called a friend#Statement-non-opinion
and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in#Statement-non-opinion
but we thought we'd try it, you know, free movie.#Statement-non-opinion
Shoot,#Appreciation
yeah.#Agree/Accept
It was so funny and it sounds like, uh, what you were just describing, SOAPDISH, too.#Statement-opinion
I mean, we just, we hurt by the time we came out.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the whole theater was hysterical#Statement-non-opinion
and it's just, it's just goofy.#Statement-opinion
I mean, it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
if you have a chance to rent it, at least,#Action-directive
or it should be out on T V, I would think,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think it is.#Statement-opinion
I think it is.#Statement-opinion
Um, cause it's, it's just a fun summer light comedy,#Statement-opinion
make your cheeks hurt laughing.#Statement-opinion
Especially in the theater it was contagious, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I imagine the way SOAPDISH was, but, with#Statement-opinion
Oh gosh#Appreciation
everyone laughing.#Other
I never laughed.#Statement-non-opinion
And people were just screaming and applauding#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, it was just hysterical.#Statement-opinion
Well, I'm glad you did that before your surgery#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, me too, because I don't even know if I could live through it now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean I'm getting around real good#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm just still real sore.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And today I was, I, course I went back to work two weeks after, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gosh.#Appreciation
but see I don't have permanent work.#Statement-non-opinion
I, right now I'm working with a temporary agency.#Statement-non-opinion
And so, the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants,#Statement-non-opinion
and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day.#Statement-non-opinion
And I said, yeah,#Statement-non-opinion
and I went#Statement-non-opinion
and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, I worked about three days a week ever since, two to three days a week.#Statement-non-opinion
And so I went to my doctors last Thursday,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and this was my fourth week checkup#Statement-non-opinion
and he said well gosh, you're just healing really well,#Statement-non-opinion
I just can't get over this.#Quotation
He says, in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things.#Statement-non-opinion
If you want to play ball, you can go play ball.#Quotation
He says, now I'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball#Statement-non-opinion
but you can#Quotation
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you want to.#Other
And, uh, you know, he was teasing me#Statement-non-opinion
and he says, yeah,#Statement-non-opinion
you'll be out there waterskiing,#Quotation
I can just see it now.#Quotation
.#Non-verbal
And, uh, he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks.#Statement-non-opinion
You've only got two more weeks.#Quotation
I said okay fine, I, I will, I will#Statement-non-opinion
Whatever you call easy, I'll do it, you know.#Quotation
But and I've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so, I don't, I'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when I was, when I'm still sort of on the sore side.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But,#Uninterpretable
well, wha-, what's your next,#Wh-Question
have you seen ROBIN HOOD yet?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
that was one, uh, Jay got to see with a friend#Statement-non-opinion
and so I#Uninterpretable
Uh.#Uninterpretable
and to try and, uh, try and find time it's hard, uh, with Jim's schedule, too, just to get a time that we can both go.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because, uh, we had friends that went to see that and said, you know, it's just perfect for our age group#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and because I think he, he needs a comedy, too.#Statement-opinion
Uh, and that's what he would have liked to have seen REGARDING HENRY, too,#Statement-non-opinion
but knew that, uh,#Uninterpretable
we've, we've got a lot of company this summer, which is wonderful.#Statement-opinion
We're really enjoying it#Statement-non-opinion
but some of the different things we're doing, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's just not a time, enough time to do it all#Other
and he said, well, realistically#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, he knew he couldn't get them all in.#Other
But, uh, Jay really liked ROBIN HOOD.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, when the choir group went to see BACKDRAFT and they thought that was, uh, it was funny cause he sounded like the critics.#Statement-non-opinion
He said, you know the plot line and the characters, uh, you know aren't real big#Statement-non-opinion
but the, the fire scenes and the dra-, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that action part is fantastic.#Other
But, he thought ROBIN HOOD was great.#Statement-non-opinion
It was real different then you'd expect,#Statement-opinion
but h-#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really?#Backchannel in question form
but he enjoyed it#Other
and so,#Uninterpretable
Well I went,#Statement-non-opinion
course I am a Kevin Costner fan.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
me too.#Statement-non-opinion
And#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

but,#Uninterpretable
Gosh, was that wonderful.#Statement-opinion
It was,#Agree/Accept
I, uh,#Uninterpretable
in fact, uh, a friend from Germany was visiting in March#Statement-non-opinion
and we wanted, we didn't, ran out of time, we wanted to take him to see it.#Statement-non-opinion
We were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I just thought that was terrific.#Statement-opinion
And I really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons I wanted to see,#Statement-non-opinion
I do, too.#Agree/Accept
I think he's really good.#Statement-opinion
And he's very good in REGARDING HENRY.#Statement-opinion
That's not an easy part to play, I, I don't think#Statement-opinion
I wouldn't think.#Agree/Accept
Well, my kids are going to their Dad's tomorrow night#Statement-non-opinion
so I sort of think I may go do that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's at, that one won't your sides#Statement-opinion
Good#Appreciation
Um, it,#Uninterpretable
was this the first time you got to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS?#Yes-No-Question
Or,#Uninterpretable
I hav-,#Uninterpretable
my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie's age#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we went to the,#Statement-non-opinion

Been on the line for awhile.#Statement-non-opinion
I almost forgot what the topic was.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, based,#Uninterpretable
Uh, but I know what it is.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Good.#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal

Uh, let me see.#Hold before answer/agreement
I, I, I, I, I'm kind of,#Uninterpretable
I don't,#Uninterpretable
you know, I'm, I'm kind of in the middle.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I think it's a great idea#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but when it comes to me, it's like, almost an insult, you know,#Statement-opinion
so it's#Uninterpretable
I, I've come from the teaching field.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
So do I#Statement-non-opinion
So, so it's just like I don't know. I, I guess, I guess I'd have to go with, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I, I'd be for it.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Other
But, uh, you know, I, I, I don't know. It's just kind of a, kind of a delicate subject I guess.#Other
But I, I, I would, I would probably go for, for going ahead and doing it, you know. If it's got to be done for everyone.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
I think if it's got to be done for one person in the company, it should be random testing, it should be for everybody.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, when they answer the company, I think it'll make it a lot easier#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they'd run into less problems.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because, uh,#Other
I don't know, I come from the teaching field too#Statement-non-opinion
and it sort of, uh,#Uninterpretable
it's a pro and a con ty-,#Statement-opinion
I don't know where to stand on it.#Hedge
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm more or less, if they told me I had to well then fine,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if, you know, if they made me then I'd probably,#Other
if I had my druthers I'd probably say well no#Statement-non-opinion
you know just this,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You kind of goes into your privacy#Collaborative Completion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
you know, but I guess if they,#Other
you know, you know, there's, uh,#Uninterpretable
I guess there's some companies that aren't, that are doing it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it, it seems to be working out#Statement-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it's, it's, what they're basically trying to do, I don't know up here in Massachusetts anyhow, what they're basically trying to do is, uh, oh gosh, uh, any people who had di-, tested positively, getting them into a drug program.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or rehab program.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, anybody who, uh, gee, is, you know, di-, doesn't accept the rehab program then they're, more or less, getting laid off.#Statement-non-opinion
See, that's hard.#Other
I, I think that's really hard to because, you know, you never know. I don't know, it,#Other
that's a,#Uninterpretable
it's really weird issue.#Statement-opinion
I'm sort of#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on the fence about it.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I,#Uninterpretable
you know, that, that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow.#Statement-opinion
Oh, we can get you into a drug program.#Quotation
But then you wear that stigma#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Where, uh, like a lot of people are saying, well I only smoked a joint last night, I don't have any problems you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or something like that,#Other
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Then I kind of hear it goes into like, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
this is just something I've heard that it kind of goes into like, uh, just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold. That it kind of affects that too.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
Anything with an-, a,#Collaborative Completion
you know, if you drink a lot of caffeine or,#Collaborative Completion
Oh, I didn't know that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
somebody was saying, telling me if you drink it in,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know, an awful lot of caffeine, that that can show up as a positive test.#Other
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know I'm an epileptic#Statement-non-opinion
so I'd probably test positive and#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
See things like that#Statement-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
and then I'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system, you know#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And a lot of times, those are the things I don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, it's very personal.#Statement-non-opinion
I wouldn't want to have it disclosed because#Statement-non-opinion
See that's,#Uninterpretable
then I'd always wonder if they fired me, you know, why did you fire me#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's where I kind of get into,#Statement-opinion
cause it kind of gets into your personal life, you know.#Statement-opinion
And#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
wha-, what's kind of next.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It, it hits me as the Orwell thing. Big brother is watching#Other
The what?#Signal-non-understanding
Orwell.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, his book. Brig, big brother is watching.#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, you're being controlled.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That type of deal#Other
and I sh-,#Uninterpretable
I don't really, you know, I don't know. Seems awful strange#Other
I'd hate to have to,#Statement-opinion
if I had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didn't#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
I'd probably take the company who didn't?#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Because I feel there'd be more trust in the employee.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
But I can understand why they need it with all the, you know, train accidents and everything else.#Statement-non-opinion
So do you think they'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually?#Yes-No-Question
I kind of think they will.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I think they will too because, uh, you know, it's just going to follow.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know. I, we haven't had any of it in our school system.#Statement-non-opinion
So, uh, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We haven't either.#Statement-non-opinion
hopefully, we won't#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I, I, I just kind of think it's heading that way though, you know. It's just, because it's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff#Statement-opinion
and I just#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way.#Other
Well and eventually it's going to be not only the tea-,#Agree/Accept
you know, the kids are#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
going to be under scrutiny, it's going to be the teachers.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And if they can test the teachers, that gives them the full right to test the kids.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then they, you know, caught everybody.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Okay.#Other
You probably, uh, more up on this subject than I am,#Statement-opinion
but, the roles that#Uninterpretable
That,#Uninterpretable
women have played in the last pup-, couple of year in our, or couple of generations.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, they've entered the work force more, uh, you know, since World War Two is when they started.#Statement-opinion
You bet.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, I think that that is, you know, very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women.#Statement-opinion
You bet.#Agree/Accept
You know, where I've noticed it more, I think, is,#Uninterpretable
I'm a traveling salesperson#Statement-non-opinion
and I have traveled most of my life#Statement-non-opinion
and I know just especially in the last, oh, ten years and really since,#Statement-non-opinion
in the last half of dozen years I see more and more women traveling.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers.#Statement-non-opinion
I sell sporting goods#Statement-non-opinion
and even in our industry, uh, there was virtually, really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things I sell#Statement-non-opinion
and even in the last five or six years, boy we see more and more women being involved#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, it's a, it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
the,#Uninterpretable
you see more of that, you see more of them, uh, leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel, too.#Statement-opinion
You bet.#Agree/Accept
You know, I, I go to a, I have a club that I belong to on Tuesday that,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, one of the girls travels quite extensively#Statement-non-opinion
and she says, well, my children have two parents.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, why not#Rhetorical-Questions
You bet.#Agree/Accept
That's sort of neat.#Appreciation
So that, that's a, I think that's a change#Statement-opinion
and I think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the, in the future, people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing.#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Agree/Accept
I think, uh, it's the age old thing,#Statement-opinion
every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on T V or something where the discussion comes out that, you know, women are paid less than men#Statement-opinion
and they're, and they're doing the same, uh, or carrying the same job responsibility#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, I, that's a very true statement#Statement-opinion
and it shouldn't, uh, it shouldn't be that way.#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
You know.#Other
That, that I think should change, will change in the near future also.#Statement-opinion
I think so, hope so,#Statement-opinion
a-,#Uninterpretable
It's been changing,#Statement-opinion
it's been evolving,#Statement-opinion
but there's still a, an, an inequality in the#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
work forces or jobs.#Other
It's, you know,#Uninterpretable
You know, I've,#Uninterpretable
And you hear some people say, you know,#Statement-opinion
well, he's a man,#Quotation
he, he, he needs that salary.#Quotation
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they forget.#Agree/Accept
Also, I think, uh, a good argument for that is in the area of politics, you know,#Statement-opinion
if a,#Uninterpretable
a woman Congressman I'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman as, and the same as a senator or whatever.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, they certainly, uh, they certainly deserve it all the way.#Statement-opinion
But, I guess just the most significant thing changed for me, again, as I mentioned, was just in traveling,#Statement-non-opinion
you see, uh, more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and, uh, and in their business suits and#Statement-non-opinion
And going,#Collaborative Completion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
and going.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I expect you're right in regards to having two parents now.#Agree/Accept
That's a good, a good statement.#Appreciation
And I think if,#Uninterpretable
in the future it's even going to be, uh, more noticeable and more significant.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I think it will be.#Agree/Accept
I think, I, well,#Uninterpretable
an-, another thing I read, too, the other day,#Statement-non-opinion
this is not just for working women#Statement-non-opinion
but how much they're out there, I guess is#Uninterpretable
the car designers, uh, are starting to design cars with women in mind. Uh, because in the past the male bought the cars,#Statement-non-opinion
but now they're showing that fifty-five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
And that they are looking for, uh, different things in the car.#Other
The man is looking for the e-, in the engine#Statement-opinion
and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel.#Statement-opinion
You bet.#Agree/Accept
Uh, can her makeup come off the upholstery#Other
Good point.#Appreciation
And if they're out there buying that many cars, then there's that many out that are self sufficient and, you know, mobile and working.#Statement-opinion
Right now I'm self employed#Statement-non-opinion
and, and my wife's always worked.#Statement-non-opinion
She's a schoolteacher,#Statement-non-opinion
but for,#Uninterpretable
she started working#Statement-non-opinion
and then when I first started my business, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
she was selling real estate at the time#Statement-non-opinion
and hers was the only income we had for three or four months#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, she certainly did her part in help getting me establishing in my business#Statement-non-opinion
and she still works everyday#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
we all do.#Statement-opinion
You bet.#Agree/Accept
I just happen to be off today.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I work, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Enj-, enjoying it#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

What kind of work do you do?#Wh-Question
I'm a nurse.#Statement-non-opinion

Married?#Declarative Yes-No-Question

Well, trying to think what else I can say in regards to this subject.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
I'm kind of out of, out of things.#Statement-non-opinion
You see the old, uh, cigarette ads, you know, about you've come a long way.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
You've come a long way baby?#Yes-No-Question
Baby,#Repeat-phrase
right,#Affirmative non-yes answers
and, uh,#Uninterpretable

You think about this when you come to, when it comes to a subject like that#Statement-opinion
and it's really true.#Statement-opinion
Women have come a long way#Statement-opinion
and, you know,#Uninterpretable

All right,#Other
uh, how long have they been recycling there in Virginia?#Wh-Question
Um, actually quite a, a, a while.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I've lived here for six years#Statement-non-opinion
and, can you hold on just a second?#Action-directive

uh-huh#Agree/Accept
Hello.#Conventional-opening
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, I'm sorry#Apology
I must have got the other line cut off.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, so, they've been doing that it for a while now#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, it,#Uninterpretable
I live in an apartment#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my ap-, facilities ,#Uninterpretable
there it is,#Statement-non-opinion
hold on#Action-directive
Uh-huh#Agree/Accept
Hello.#Conventional-opening
Okay,#Other
sorry about that#Apology
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
okay,#Downplayer
you're okay,#Downplayer
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
okay#Other
Uh, anyhow, they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I've been recycling for maybe about two years now and, at ano-, ano-, another public facility#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where they have, you know, recycling of glass, uh, aluminum and paper.#Other
Now,#Uninterpretable
Have you, have you cycled, recycled plastic also?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
and that's what I, I don't understand exactly why they don't have that option.#Statement-non-opinion
We, we have out here#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way,#Other
they had some bends, *#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
around that we could find and put them in#Other
but not all that many,#Statement-non-opinion
it wasn't very well advertised#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but recently, uh, the refuse department has, has, uh, is working on getting a system going where we will actually have, uh, a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it, it should be good, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it's a marvelous idea when you think of, uh, when I just think of the papers that I dump out#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean there just,#Uninterpretable
it's such a#Uninterpretable
I waste,#Uninterpretable
I just hate to think about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now an additional thing is, uh,#Uninterpretable
where I work#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they also have recycling there of, uh, all white paper and of, you know, cans also#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, I mean, a lot of people, you know, right at the vending machines,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they have receptacles that, you know,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you can just pop your cans in#Other
and near the,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Xerox machines they have places, you know, for your,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
paper,#Other
you know, I keep a little box at my desk, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I just throw, as I'm using the white paper, you know, I just throw it right in there,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then, you know, they have someone that comes around and pick it up, you know, every afternoon#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's neat.#Appreciation
which, you know, is an excellent idea,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at work because I know the amount paper they go through there#Other
because,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
I guess one of the things, I think, that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
about it,#Other
there's needs to be more public, uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I would agree with that.#Agree/Accept
service of, programs or something that would let us know had a happens to it#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and there's,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've seen a few things but not very much,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
really#Other
and I, I think that's a shame#Statement-opinion
they need to, uh, do a little more,#Statement-opinion
I'd like to know, for instance, when I, when they say, uh, plastic, all plastic, what kind of plastic,#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
can you put all together or,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is there some reason not to,#Other
uh, now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I, I'd be glad to organize it,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if that they'd tell me what it is I'm doing#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because that would, that would be really helpful. *#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree with you there,#Agree/Accept
another thing that I like here which is,#Uninterpretable
I do with,#Uninterpretable
I have to actually go to two different recycling areas because one of them is that, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
their aluminum cans is for, uh, Children's Hospital, for a burn fund#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so all the monies are donated, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for the recycling to Children's Hospital, which I think is an excellent idea,#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's great.#Appreciation
there, you know, because the other,#Other
Now that gives,#Statement-opinion
public,#Other
you a little bit of incentive there.#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
right,#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and before even at work,#Uninterpretable
before they started the recycling plan, which at work they've only been doing since January first of this year, I had had everyone in my department recycling#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, I would have them drop,#Statement-non-opinion
Saving them for you, uh.#Summarize/reformulate
right, drop their cans off in my office#Other
and then I would haul them, you know, here to this place for the Children's Hospital Fund#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which got people really going into it,#Other
I think that's,#Appreciation
but,#Uninterpretable
right.#Other
I think, I think helping us be more enthu-, enthusiastic about it,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
helping us maybe, maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt#Other
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
*#Non-verbal
That,#Uninterpretable
there you go.#Agree/Accept
Making sure *#Other
That's for sure.#Agree/Accept
But I, I think that's#Uninterpretable
right I think they, there needs to be a little bit more in the area of, of, uh, ad-, advertisement,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and letting, public letting you understand,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
more of what it is you're doing, why you're doing it, how you're it's done and,#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
what, what happens to it because I think that's, that would help a lot.#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I'm sure, you know, in the near future I would think they would be coming out with more,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, I've seen a definite trend, you know, towards more recycling,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
everywhere, you know, even at McDonald's,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, with their, their use of no,#Other
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I'm glad,#Statement-non-opinion
foam containers anymore.#Other
to see some of these things, I think.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think, I think it is getting more, you know, advertisement.#Statement-opinion
People are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and all these things that,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's true.#Agree/Accept
Well, I think,#Uninterpretable
I'm that's about my, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
some on recycling#Other

like compared to Vietnam#Other

Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and,#Uninterpretable
you know, and support the soldiers,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
I know that, uh, I've heard people say that you know when people that went to World War Two#Statement-non-opinion
you couldn't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but then in Vietnam that was totally different, you know,#Statement-opinion
you couldn't be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And now,#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a, a good candidate.#Other
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it would be like a bonus for your,#Statement-opinion
E-,#Appreciation
image or something.#Other
exactly, exactly.#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it,#Uninterpretable
I'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income,#Statement-opinion
Oh, torn apart.#Collaborative Completion
Oh, yea-,#Uninterpretable
just drastically altered.#Other
We had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a, just had a new baby,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, they would have, she would have had to go back to work#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds.#Other
So it,#Uninterpretable
that's also a good reason why it, it,#Statement-opinion
or good that it ended as soon as it did.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think the biggest change that we've seen, um, in, in my life or whatever lately is the economy,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Other
and things are so tight,#Statement-opinion
and like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Exactly,#Appreciation
you know.#Other
and it seems like everything is raising, every-, everything that can be, cigarettes,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
not that I smoke, but cigarettes, um, uh, stamps,#Other
I mean it seems like ever-,#Statement-opinion
Even dog licenses#Statement-opinion
I mean,#Uninterpretable
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
everything single thing that we do,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is higher,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know. And they just raised the minimum wage today#Statement-non-opinion
but that's not like, you know,#Statement-opinion
Going to effect too many,#Collaborative Completion
as much as they should have raised it I'm sure.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
So, that's the hardest thing for us#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home.#Statement-non-opinion
We have a three year old and a two year old#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm trying to stay home as long as I can,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, you know, every week it gets harder#Statement-non-opinion
because I could go out and be making money,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, so that's a big, uh, stress I think,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, for the social changes in our family.#Other
I don't, I don't have any children or anything right now#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, uh, I work as a news reporter in Waco,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so,#Uninterpretable
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I get to see,#Statement-non-opinion
I got to see a lot of not firsthand but, uh, probably a good part of the war, um, as far as what people thought about it,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a lot of things like that,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well i-,#Uninterpretable
It was kind of amazing#Statement-non-opinion
people were coming to me to ask me, you know, what's going on, you know, like I knew,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
or like I sat in on the meetings or something.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you have an inside track or something.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
So, I got to hear a lot of what the people thought about, you know, changes in, in the war and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
so that was pretty interesting.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
what other social changes in the past ten years, oh,#Self-talk
I guess between men and women I've seen a lot of changes,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career, be mom, be,#Other
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
be everything, be supermom,#Collaborative Completion
everything, superperson#Other
exactly.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I know, you know, I, I really get pressure from, because I have a career also,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
and I get a lot of pressure from people that, you know, my colleagues#Statement-non-opinion
that#Uninterpretable
why am I staying home. You know,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
whereas before that never would have happened#Statement-opinion
Whereas it would have been,#Statement-opinion
people would have said, why are you going to work.#Statement-opinion
Exactly, um.#Agree/Accept
So, that's kind of a difference for us.#Statement-opinion
I think there's more pressure to, um, not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So he's,#Uninterpretable
The roles are changing a lot.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he's gotten a lot, uh, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all,#Statement-opinion
but in terms of his amount of hours at work, nothing on that has lightened up.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, it's now he has the pressure too of being superdad and supercareer#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
And even, you know, I think a lot of the movies we see now kind of, kind of play a good part in our changes#Statement-opinion
because, you see that they have THE THREE MEN AND A BABY type movies.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true,#Appreciation
And I think, you know that,#Statement-opinion
MISTER MOM#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then you have the women, uh, detectives now and, you know, different roles,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just in what we see#Uninterpretable
and so we probably want to do that even more now.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know since the women's movement in the, wh-, seventies,#Other
That's true.#Appreciation
and, you know, we've come a long way but I think it's still a, still have a good ways to go.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
I think there's still,#Uninterpretable
I, I know that, um, I grew up in Chicago in the sixties,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and was part,#Uninterpretable
my family was real liberal,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think there's a lot of, um, kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and race relations and things like that,#Other
and, you know, I think there's so much prejudice still there,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
and it's kind of more covert now.#Statement-opinion
People used to be more clear and say,#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
you know, well, I believe in this or I believe in that,#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
and now, you know, I think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice,#Statement-opinion
It's just not as,#Uninterpretable
but people think, oh, we're in the nineties, we're beyond all that, you know#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
But it's,#Uninterpretable
I mean like I say, we've come a long way, but we have, I mean, twice as far to go,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
still,#Other
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I don't think a lot of people, you know, realize a lot, the plight of a lot of people.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you,#Other
But there's so many more people,#Collaborative Completion
but there's so many more people,#Other
that are homeless#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
exactly, that you don't even, *#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that you don't even see or know about.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's real easy to get isolated in your own little community,#Statement-opinion
Oh, oh, yeah.#Appreciation
you know, because wh-, when I was growing up in Chicago, um, we were in a real ethnic neighborhood#Statement-non-opinion
and there were people from all, first generation Chinese, German, you know all different nationalities,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and everything.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And now we're kind of like in Lewisville, Miss White Little suburbia,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
I mean I don't even know anybody that#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know , from any place other than Texas hardly,#Other
I grew up in,#Statement-non-opinion
you know.#Other
in Brooklyn, New York,#Other
Oh, boy.#Appreciation
and so I was just, I was just surrounded, you know, by Black people,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I'm Black,#Statement-non-opinion
and so, you know I lived, that's where I lived.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so now, I, I feel lucky actually because I've almost lived around everyone.#Statement-non-opinion
I've, I went to U T to college,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so they, you know, they have a lot of different people go there,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
different kinds of people.#Other
And so I feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, some people have lived in Lewisville all their life, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they,#Statement-opinion
and so they don't get to see,#Other
they think the whole world, is like that.#Other
Exactly And th-,#Appreciation
We lived in a dorm.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband and I met in graduate school,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at Indiana University#Other
and I was, ours was, uh, international co-, you know, co-ed dorm,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and there were twelve hundred students,#Statement-non-opinion
they're graduate students from all over the world.#Statement-non-opinion
And once we came here it was like,#Statement-non-opinion
gosh,#Hold before answer/agreement
I just miss that,#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly.#Appreciation
because it really is exciting,#Statement-opinion
It is.#Agree/Accept
to be around people of different cultures and different backgrounds.#Other
We got invited to,#Statement-non-opinion
one guy practically roasted a goat in his, in his dorm#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Oh, my God.#Appreciation
I wonder if he was from, Iran, or some place,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know where#Hedge
but, um, you know.#Uninterpretable
Well, there's so many people who have never, you know, even gotten to do that,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Other
so that's great.#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My sister was telling me she met a gi-, she's going to the University of Pennsylvania in, in Philadelphia,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, she just met a girl from, um, I think, Barbados or Jamaica, or something,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like that.#Other
And I mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and everything#Other
and,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars.#Other
So my sister had to take her shopping and, you know, show her what to wear, show her how to match up colors#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, God.#Appreciation
I just thought that was so very exciting,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, to go and, and just witness, you know, this girl just coming to America type thing, you know.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
really#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you know, I would have loved it, the opportunity to do that,#Statement-non-opinion
That is part,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
of the change I think that I've seen probably, you know, in the past twenty years or whatever, is now kids have to have so much.#Other
I mean I even get caught up in it with our kids,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even though I buy most of the things at garage sales for their Christmas,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, people ha-, you know think they're kids have to have five, hundred dollars worth of toys.#Statement-opinion
the latest cereal about, you know, th-,#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's just,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's ridiculous,#Statement-opinion

When I first moved here I was only thirteen but, everyone had a car in school, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gosh.#Appreciation
and I couldn't, and I just couldn't belie-, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I was from New York and so, you know, we road the bus.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
me too,#Statement-non-opinion
And if you had a ca-,#Uninterpretable
in Chicago#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I didn't even date a guy that had a car until I was in college#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
And if you had a car y-, there was nowhere to park it anyway#Statement-non-opinion
or, you know, it's just,#Uninterpretable
you just didn't have a car,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools#Statement-non-opinion
and I couldn't understand it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, all the kids had cars,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they, you know, have to have a car.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gosh,#Appreciation
So that was,#Statement-non-opinion
my kids are going to be hating me,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I'll give them a bike and say,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
here's it#Other
so you can afford to pay the insurance,#Quotation
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know#Other
Or live really close to school and have them walk.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
no,#Appreciation
But,#Uninterpretable

So,#Uninterpretable
Well did we cover it everything Betty ?#Yes-No-Question

Okay,#Other
in order to make the, uh, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
until it was nice and brown, you know#Other
make sure it's nice and brown on both sides#Action-directive
and then you take it out of the fat#Action-directive
and you, you let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it#Action-directive
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then you, you, uh, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan#Action-directive
and you kind of clean it out#Action-directive
and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil.#Action-directive
Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there.#Action-directive
And then you, uh, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water.#Action-directive
Stir it real, real well.#Action-directive
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Then you, uh, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy.#Action-directive
And you let it come to a boil again#Action-directive
and then you let it simmer#Action-directive
and you add, uh, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder.#Action-directive
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's going to, it's going to be really good#Statement-opinion
That's very spicy, too.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's,#Uninterpretable
I mean these bell peppers and curry.#Summarize/reformulate
Right,#Agree/Accept
and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that sounds really good.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess it was,#Statement-non-opinion
is this dinner time for you?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, well it will be in a little while,#Affirmative non-yes answers
I'm trying to get it, get it ready early.#Statement-non-opinion
All done in advance,#Summarize/reformulate
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's um, I, uh, I'm, I'm not that great a cook#Statement-non-opinion
but I was single until I was thirty#Statement-non-opinion
so I did cook a little, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and I cook a little bit now.#Statement-non-opinion
What I like to do mostly is stir fries#Statement-non-opinion
and my wife normally says, oh, Tom, why, why don't you make a stir fry tonight#Statement-non-opinion
and so we even, we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we do a lot of, um, stir fry vegetables.#Statement-non-opinion
What kind of wok do you have,#Wh-Question
is it, is it a real Chinese wok.#Yes-No-Question
It's, it's called a stir fry pan#Statement-non-opinion
and it, and it fits right on your, uh, st-, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric#Statement-non-opinion
so it's, it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, normally what happ-, what we do is, um, just, you know, like two tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular oi-, vegetable oil.#Statement-non-opinion
But I will use peanut, peanut oil, or things.#Statement-non-opinion
And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, um, green peppers, and, um, maybe put in a little bit of, um garlic and ginger, uh, beforehand.#Statement-non-opinion
That gives, uh, uh, uh, spicier flavor#Statement-non-opinion
and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, um, a little bit of, uh, sometimes chicken broth,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and corn starch and soy sauce#Other
and that sort of makes a, uh, a glaze,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that sticks to the, the vegetables,#Other
I've used,#Uninterpretable
you turn them over.#Statement-non-opinion
A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu,#Statement-non-opinion
we don't put in meat,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
cause I guess we're, I'm not#Other
but, uh, she likes to watch all the, how much red meat and things,#Statement-non-opinion
so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, uh, carrots and celery and green peppers and, um, oh, gee, mushrooms.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh that's,#Statement-opinion
It's, it's a pretty big#Statement-non-opinion
and we put that over rice.#Statement-non-opinion
That sounds real good except the squash,#Other
I just don't like squash.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you don't#Summarize/reformulate
I never did.#Statement-non-opinion
My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash#Statement-non-opinion
and she'd have squash and corn bread#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I'd just be,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
see, we never, in fact I never had squash growing up.#Statement-non-opinion
My, my wife eats more vegetables, ate more vegetable than I did growing up.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, I'm from Pittsburgh#Statement-non-opinion

We, we were from North Carolina#Statement-non-opinion

You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens#Statement-non-opinion
Well that was a real farm.#Summarize/reformulate
You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?#Yes-No-Question

I've heard stories.#Statement-non-opinion
And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub#Statement-non-opinion
and finally it dies down,#Statement-non-opinion
you get just a little patter#Statement-non-opinion
and then it,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, this is ter-,#Statement-opinion
you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while you're fixing dinner.#Action-directive
Getting ready to eat chicken too.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
you should be careful#Action-directive
That's pretty funny.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But my dad used to tell stories, you know, about the way they eat chickens#Statement-non-opinion

Well that's good.#Appreciation
A lot of people are eating healthier now a days.#Statement-opinion

Ugh.#Appreciation
uh, we came back with sweets.#Other
We didn't bring all the healthy food back too.#Statement-non-opinion

I'm trying to learn how to cook, um, deserts without, without all of the sweets, you know, maybe use honey or something.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well that's, that's supposed to be, um, the trend of the future,#Statement-non-opinion

and it'll say you've over extended your conversation, you now have fifteen minutes to compl-, fifteen seconds to complete it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh wow.#Appreciation
But, uh, I've been cut off twice.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I just thought,#Statement-non-opinion
in fact I'm just also,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm hearing a siren outside I think my, my neighbors car must have got bumped, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
he has one of those alarms on his car,#Statement-non-opinion
Goodness.#Appreciation
one of the, the neighbor has an alarm on a car#Statement-non-opinion
and it's going off.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I was going to go out and see what they were doing.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
hey thanks so much.#Thanking
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
thank you,#Thanking
it was nice talking with you.#Conventional-closing
Uh-huh,#Conventional-closing
and you said this was your fi-,#Summarize/reformulate
well you'll, you'll get a couple more probably.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, uh, I called yesterday, I, or Friday,#Statement-non-opinion
maybe I talked to somebody that, uh, I got them on, uh, during the day.#Statement-non-opinion
It was a housewife#Statement-non-opinion
and she was home with two kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Ugh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background, you know, that they wanted something#Statement-non-opinion
and they were arguing back and forth#Statement-non-opinion
and she just kept talking the whole time,#Statement-non-opinion
it was pretty funny.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
kind of hard that way.#Summarize/reformulate
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Hey thanks a lot,#Thanking
I'll talk to you later.#Conventional-closing
All right,#Conventional-closing
thank you,#Thanking
bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay, Howard,#Other
what do you think of our space budget#Open-Question
and should we go ahead and, and keep exploring,#Yes-No-Question
or should we call a halt to it,#Or-Clause
is it doing any good?#Yes-No-Question
I think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country.#Statement-opinion
Now I think what, we made a major wrong turn when we went into the, uh, to the current generation of space craft, the reusable ones, like they are now#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because they have not proven as reliable as they should have,#Other
and I think some of the earlier approaches were much more, uh, much better in many ways.#Statement-opinion
However, uh, you know, we've gained an awful lot from the space program, all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to, uh, some new space age materials, plastics and all that.#Statement-opinion
So I think it's been a good investment.#Statement-opinion
Uh, somebody was telling me the return was about twenty-five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which is amazing for any governmental financed#Other
Oh, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
program.#Other
Wish our post office could do that#Statement-non-opinion
I wish the post office would just stop raising our rates.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
I wish they'd just deliver stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
I think, though, that now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and the, uh, oh, I don't know, the guilt that we had out of, uh, Challenger,#Statement-opinion
I think maybe we can#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
pick up and go on now.#Other
But, I, I don't know.#Hedge
I don't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives.#Statement-opinion
I agree.#Agree/Accept
The space station's where we should go#Statement-opinion
I agree.#Agree/Accept
at this point.#Other
Seems like that we've kind of gotten side tracked with putting all these different things up there to monitor#Statement-opinion
and, you know, you know, and I'm in favor of, you know, getting closer to seeing certain things,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'd like to see them also go, you know, go back up there, see, you know, what they can do. See about setting a space station up.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm all in favor of the space program,#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't think we should stop,#Statement-opinion
and I don't think we should cut the money.#Statement-opinion
Well, where do you think we ought to go with it?#Open-Question
Uh.#Hold before answer/agreement
You talking about, uh, uh, a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I would like, I'd like to see that.#Statement-non-opinion
I'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and see what's going on, even if, you know, there's no life up there or anything, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
But who knows.#Hedge
And I would like to see them do something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
I, I hate to see them just, you know, keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things#Statement-opinion
and, I think they, I think they lose sight of, of probably what they're supposed to be doing.#Statement-opinion
Well, I think about half the nations now are, are military related, are they not?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
yes.#Yes answers
And, uh,#Statement-opinion
I believe they are.#Statement-non-opinion
It seems like it's that high a percentage.#Other
You know, let's go back to our original thing with, you know, our experiments and all the, you know, our actual exploring of space and, and all that,#Action-directive
and, you know, with, with Russia, uh, seemingly not going to be as big a threat.#Statement-opinion
Well, it can't afford to#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh, you know.#Agree/Accept
Have you gone out to, uh, Fort Worth to see the space, Soviet space exhibit?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
we were talking about that this weekend.#Statement-non-opinion
We, it's only going to be there a couple of more weeks.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We need to go.#Statement-non-opinion
We went, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
we took our grandsons and went, uh, the weekend before last,#Statement-non-opinion
and it is marvelous.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it's really neat how they, they have done it.#Statement-non-opinion
They have done a beautiful job.#Statement-non-opinion
Have they?#Backchannel in question form
And they have a, uh, scaled down model showing how they, you know, fuel it, or, you know, how they, uh, oh, the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
all the things that are against the actual space mission, uh, space ship, you know, how they fall away from it,#Statement-non-opinion
and the loading of it#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then it's actually, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
the smoke comes out like it's taking off.#Statement-non-opinion
It is really interesting.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, maybe I need to run out there this weekend.#Statement-opinion
You really do.#Agree/Accept
It's, it's well worth the time and effort.#Statement-non-opinion
We went, uh, early on Sunday.#Statement-non-opinion
We got out there about, uh, ten, ten thirty,#Statement-non-opinion
and the,#Uninterpretable
Now do you have to have tickets ahead?#Yes-No-Question
Excuse me.#Apology
No,#No answers
we bought tickets there,#Statement-non-opinion
and if you have children, if you go to McDonald's, you co-, they have coupons, or did have.#Statement-non-opinion
Now they may be through with them now.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, buy one adult#Statement-non-opinion
and one child gets in free.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I think both of my kids are too old for that#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're both, uh,#Uninterpretable
You have teenagers or something.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
yes.#Yes answers
Yes,#Repeat-phrase
.#Non-verbal
well I had grandchildren so, three of them, so between their mother and their grandfather and I,#Statement-non-opinion
because their dad was at work#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Did you,#Uninterpretable
But, and the boys loved it, you know,#Other
they really did like it.#Statement-non-opinion
It's very impressive, I'm sure.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh,#Yes answers
it is,#Statement-non-opinion
and I felt the, uh, six year old would, you know, that he'd be kind of bored,#Statement-non-opinion
but he wasn't.#Statement-non-opinion
Even the three year old enjoyed it#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
because they had one, had one of those moon vehicles#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and had it so it looked like it was on the moon, and showed it moving around and stuff.#Other
So it was really neat.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, see, that's something else.#Appreciation
The Russians have had space stations, manned stat-, space stations for years now.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, they had the Merv#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and see we've yet to keep anyone up over#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
over a week or ten days.#Other
Well, in going through it, I got the impression that actually they were farther ahead,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay,#Other
what kind of hobbies do you have?#Open-Question
Um, mostly what I do,#Statement-non-opinion
I do do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing,#Statement-non-opinion
and then I, I read a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like to read, too#Statement-non-opinion
I was trying to think of some while, while it was, uh, talking about it,#Statement-non-opinion
and then I,#Uninterpretable
it took so long for someone to answer,#Statement-non-opinion
I started reading the#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
newspaper, and kind of forgot about it#Other
.#Non-verbal
But, uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'd say reading is probably one of my biggest ones, because it's the type of thing that you can, you can do a little bit at a time, whereas, I would love to do crafts and stuff if I just had the time to do it#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or if I had the space.#Other
I live in a pretty small apartment,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I would have to, you know, put stuff away.#Statement-non-opinion
I have two cats,#Statement-non-opinion
so I couldn't really leave it out if I was working on something.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Reading is a little bit easier to work around.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you can pick it up and take it wherever you go.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
any space.#Other
I get too involved in reading sometimes that I neglect what I should be doing.#Statement-non-opinion
That's true,#Agree/Accept
I do the same thing#Statement-non-opinion
You get so involved in what you're reading.#Statement-opinion
What types of crafts do you do?#Open-Question
I do a little bit of woodworking,#Statement-non-opinion
well, I used to.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't have the equipment here.#Statement-non-opinion
We moved to Dallas about a year ago#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I did some of that. Um,#Statement-non-opinion
here I've mostly done things that I can do strictly by hand, um, sewing and quilting and, um,#Statement-non-opinion
what else have I done ?#Self-talk
Things to hang on the wall.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Mostly just stuff that I can, you know, use right around the house#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or give away as gifts.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've been making a lot of quilts, well, not a lot, but several quilts lately.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
I enjoy, uh, sewing and needlework also.#Statement-non-opinion
I've, I've, uh, made some small things, cross stitch things.#Statement-non-opinion
And, um#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
back when I was in high school, I worked at a needlework shop,#Other
and I, I used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I still remember how to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
It's just been so long since I've actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
But I have recently done some cross stitch.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I enjoy doing that.#Statement-non-opinion
It's just the same old thing,#Statement-opinion
it's just getting the time to do it#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I've done some cross, um, cross stitch,#Statement-non-opinion
but I never count right,#Statement-non-opinion
and I always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or, or something.#Other
It never has worked out completely.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it takes a lot of concentration.#Statement-opinion
I mean, it was the type of thing,#Statement-non-opinion
I was, I was making some little things for Christmas,#Statement-non-opinion
and I also made a little thing for a baby gift,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I thought, Oh, I can do this while I watch T V.#Statement-non-opinion
Wrong#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No,#Reject
you must pay all attention to what you're doing.#Statement-opinion
It's, it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be.#Statement-opinion
It took me, uh, quite a bit of time.#Statement-non-opinion
I though, Oh, this won't take long at all.#Statement-non-opinion
But#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was wrong.#Other
It took, it took a while to do.#Statement-non-opinion
But, it was fun,#Statement-non-opinion
I enjoyed it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The first project I started out one was a big one,#Statement-non-opinion
it was, uh, it was of a lady#Statement-non-opinion
and she was kneeling,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh my gosh.#Appreciation
And I,#Uninterpretable
it was just too much to start with.#Statement-non-opinion
And I still haven't finished it, because I, I stopped,#Statement-non-opinion
and I thought I better do some simple things and work up to this#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because it was just so difficult#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to get it done.#Other
And there were so many different shadings and colors,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, it was just too much to begin with.#Statement-non-opinion
And I think kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's pretty understandable.#Appreciation
And I've done some of the crewel and the, um#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
something similar to that#Other
but it doesn't have the specific stitches.#Statement-non-opinion
Anyway, it's a little bit more loose, and not quite as structured,#Statement-non-opinion
and I like that a little bit better#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the variety of stitches and stuff in that.#Other
More like embroidery or something.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm trying to think of anything else I do as a hobby. Um. I don't even watch T V very much.#Statement-non-opinion
I was tonight,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was reading when you called.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How about movies,#Open-Question
do you like to go to movies?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah#Yes answers
I do, I do like to go to movies,#Statement-non-opinion
and I have a V C R,#Statement-non-opinion
so I like to rent movies,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, I have, right now I have the movie channel,#Statement-non-opinion
so I've recorded quite a few movies off of that. Um,#Statement-non-opinion
just, I've kind of got a collection going of tapes now,#Statement-non-opinion
and whenever I go visit my parents, they're always saying, Well, bring some of your tapes#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
They always borrow a few of them.#Statement-non-opinion
I was over there,#Statement-non-opinion
they live in Duncanville#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I was over there at Easter,#Statement-non-opinion
and they said, Bring some tapes with you.#Statement-non-opinion
So they are always borrowing my tapes.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well we,#Uninterpretable
I like to, I like to do, uh, stuff with plants.#Statement-non-opinion
I like, um, I have a lot of plants in my apartment,#Statement-non-opinion
and I've got a pretty small porch,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's, it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
I've got a few planters out there that I, I'll, uh, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
in the winter time I usually plant some pansies in there,#Statement-non-opinion
and then in the summer I'll plant petunias,#Statement-non-opinion
or something that's colorful#Statement-non-opinion
and like, that blooms a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
But#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
haven't done that yet.#Other
I kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think we're probably past that now.#Statement-non-opinion
I probably should go buy some.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess if I had a house I might enjoy gardening, some.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's the hard work.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I like the planting, and watering is okay.#Statement-non-opinion
It's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers,#Statement-opinion
it's so beau-,#Statement-opinion
I mean, we don't.#Statement-non-opinion
We live in an apartment also.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've got a few plants here,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm not really knowledgeable.#Statement-non-opinion
I feel real good if I water them#Statement-non-opinion
and they continue to grow.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I feel like, Oh, I've accomplished something.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I enjoy it,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm just not experienced enough with#Statement-non-opinion
it.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know too much about it either.#Statement-non-opinion
Mine's pretty limited to my little, uh, porch plants#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
And then the ones in my apartment, half of which don't look real healthy,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't always get direct sun except in certain spots.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so that's probably my problem there.#Statement-non-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
Have you tried any, growing any, um, like fruits and vegetables or anything?#Yes-No-Question
I guess vegetables are in, insi-, like in pots and stuff?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I never have tried that, just because I don't have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or this little balcony.#Other
And my other two pots are,#Statement-non-opinion
they're kind of, they're pretty big,#Statement-non-opinion
and I have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area,#Statement-non-opinion
so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
there's no room for much else.#Other
But my dad, uh, my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'd, I think when I was real little I probably had a finger in on that every time he did it#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff.#Other
But I've never really tried anything like that since then.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I considered it last year#Statement-non-opinion
and this year both,#Statement-non-opinion
but I haven't done anything about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So. I think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch.#Statement-opinion
We get lots of sunlight here,#Statement-non-opinion
and the porch is screened in#Statement-non-opinion
and it's pretty large.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
So, um, I think if I just would be,#Uninterpretable
if I'd do something, be motivated enough to do something, I think it would work out well.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, but there goes that motivation thing again#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Well, I enjoy playing with my cats.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if you'd call that a hobby,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
but I have two cats,#Statement-non-opinion
and I gave them a bath tonight,#Statement-non-opinion
so they're a little bit angry at me#Statement-non-opinion
. Can you#Yes-No-Question
They didn't like it too much.#Statement-non-opinion
can you put them right in the water?#Other
Yeah,#Yes answers
oh yeah#Yes answers
Oh, that's good,#Appreciation
right in the tub,#Statement-non-opinion
and it helps because its the time of the year that they're shedding a lot, and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine.#Statement-non-opinion
So I thought,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
this'll help, you know, help them shed,#Other
and sure enough, boy the fur just came off like crazy once I got them#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the tub.#Other
So, they're pretty content now,#Statement-non-opinion
but they were mad at me for quite a while.#Statement-non-opinion
They went and hid after they, after they got dried off.#Statement-non-opinion
Sulked for a while, huh#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Well, I like animals,#Statement-non-opinion
but we don't have any yet.#Statement-non-opinion
We have a nine month old with another on the way#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we thought, well maybe when they're a little bit bigger#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then we'll,#Other
or get into a house with a little more space.#Statement-non-opinion
I'd love to have, have some animals.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I like dogs#Statement-non-opinion
and my husband likes cats.#Statement-non-opinion
So we haven't reached a real agreement on that yet.#Statement-non-opinion
If we get a place where we can have both, it'll be great,#Statement-non-opinion
but until then,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like both,#Statement-non-opinion
but since I'm in an apartment, I just, I don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog.#Statement-opinion
Dogs, to me, dogs need a yard, even little dogs.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They just need a yard.#Statement-opinion
Cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine.#Statement-opinion
But I just think dogs need, need to be outside, though.#Statement-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
I agree with you.#Agree/Accept
I,#Uninterpretable
if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat, or even a bird or a fish tank or something, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now that's an idea#Appreciation
Something small#Other
with the small babies.#Uninterpretable
that she can watch, but won't take too much care.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because, you kind of,#Uninterpretable
even, even a cat, you never know when they might bite or scratch or something.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There not as likely to as a dog might, I guess.#Statement-opinion
But with little ones, I'd be kind of scared to get anything that has teeth or claws.#Statement-non-opinion
Especially when they're not quite to the age of understanding that they're hurting, you know,#Statement-opinion
that#Uninterpretable
they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk.#Statement-opinion
Oh yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And if I was a cat or dog, I'd respond probably by biting or something.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
Oh, yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That'd be my self defense.#Statement-non-opinion
But,#Conventional-closing
Uh-huh#Conventional-closing
Well, I think we probably reached our time limit.#Other
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
probably#Conventional-closing
so, and I'm out of, out of good ideas for a hobby anyway.#Conventional-closing
Oh, okay.#Conventional-closing
Well it was good talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Thank you for calling.#Conventional-closing
All right.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Uh, I guess I've always kind of liked golf.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I worked on a golf course at, at one time#Statement-non-opinion
and that's how I picked up golf.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, I don't know#Hedge
it's just a, kind of a challenging game.#Statement-opinion
It sure is.#Agree/Accept
I play at least three times a week.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm on it,#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't gotten the chance lately though to play.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm trying to get back into it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, so, uh, I got to start all over again.#Statement-non-opinion
It's not like riding a bicycle.#Statement-opinion
You do tend to,#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
forget.#Other
Well, I'm one of those rare left-handed golfers.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I do enjoy playing.#Statement-non-opinion
What is your handicap?#Wh-Question
Right now it's three.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Uh, I was down at about four or five quite awhile ago.#Statement-non-opinion
It's probably up there to twenty now if I to start again.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, if you play with some consistency though, you can get it right back down.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have got to try and get out there.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I know with our, our long winters I, I enjoy watching it.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if it's just because I like the game or I just like to, to see the warm weather.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, well, we can usually play here year around.#Statement-non-opinion
Sometimes in January it's not too comfortable to play.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play,#Statement-opinion
and I'm pretty much addicted to golf,#Statement-non-opinion
so. I get out there one way or the other.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter#Statement-non-opinion
you almost have to relearn every spring to, to get back out.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a good game though.#Statement-opinion
It's very challenging#Statement-opinion
and the reason I like it so much is because I'm essentially playing against myself.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's the way I look at it.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I play in, in lo-, a lot of groups#Statement-non-opinion
and but I, they keep score and, between themselves#Statement-non-opinion
but I really don't care.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I go out#Statement-non-opinion
and each shot I say, well, this is what I'm going to try to do#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then I see how close I can come to that.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you always work on trying to improve each day#Summarize/reformulate
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and i-, inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another.#Statement-non-opinion
Either I'm not driving very well#Statement-non-opinion
or I'm not hitting long irons very well#Statement-non-opinion
or I'm not putting well#Statement-non-opinion
or, but sometimes it all comes together.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I know what you mean.#Agree/Accept
I, when I used to golf out there I'd putt well but I, I wouldn't, uh, chip well.#Statement-non-opinion
One of the two, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
or something would go wrong#Statement-non-opinion
but I always managed to, to get near par anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I went to that.#Statement-non-opinion
Craig Statler won in a playoff.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But we, uh,#Uninterpretable
this is a big golf area.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We have a lot of, uh,#Uninterpretable
I'd say we probably have within fifteen miles, twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course, Pine Hurst#Statement-non-opinion
and we still have the Greensboro Open here every year.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you have, uh, long waits, uh, to get on the course?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
we do as a matter of fact.#Statement-non-opinion
It, it, uh, it's only been that way in the last five years.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But now you, uh,#Uninterpretable
most of the courses have a, uh, two day advance tee time you have to call,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just moved into this small community#Statement-non-opinion
so I'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here.#Statement-non-opinion

Usually January and the first two weeks of February.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I wish that's all we had.#Appreciation
But, uh, last week we were in the seventies.#Statement-non-opinion
Something is coming through now#Statement-non-opinion
so it's like in the low forties right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties.#Statement-non-opinion
We have very windy winters#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and very cold.#Other
But we don't get any snow anymore.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't, I don't know what changed that pattern.#Statement-non-opinion
We used to get four or five inches a year.#Statement-non-opinion
Now we get nothing.#Statement-non-opinion
It's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall.#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, at least it, that doesn't, uh, get in the way of golfing#Statement-opinion
so that#Uninterpretable
No,#Agree/Accept
but I have played golf in the snow before. *#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Get out my orange golf ball and go out.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's what they do here sometimes.#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Did we do what was correct there?#Yes-No-Question
I think we should have stayed longer.#Statement-opinion
Should we have fought them harder?#Yes-No-Question
Used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh, I think what we did was good,#Affirmative non-yes answers
but I think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do.#Statement-opinion
Oh, you agree with Schwartzkopf who says, uh, Drive on into Baghdad.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
I think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now.#Statement-opinion
And it's almost like they're killing each other off#Statement-opinion
and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all#Statement-opinion
Would that be so bad?#Yes-No-Question
Was there anything there to begin with?#Yes-No-Question
Well, I think, I don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it, um.#Statement-opinion
It wasn't ours.#Statement-opinion
Well, no,#Agree/Accept
I just mean that, that, the world in general#Statement-opinion
We've got to talk so it's just, just as well we argue.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Um, I don't know,#Hedge
I think we should have helped the, the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more,#Statement-opinion
I agree.#Agree/Accept
than, rather than just quitting where we did.#Other
Wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country.#Yes-No-Question
Yes#Yes answers
But I think that's almost impossible, next to impossible.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So other political things that's going on.#Other
I heard Mister Bush say, excuse me, President Bush say that he, uh, wanted to improve the highways.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, see, I haven't really been keeping up with them#Statement-non-opinion

What did he say about it?#Wh-Question
Oh, he wanted to take the current secondary highway system#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country.#Other
We don't have the money for that.#Statement-opinion
But wouldn't it be wonderful.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
It would be really nice because I'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes#Affirmative non-yes answers
And back east,#Yes-No-Question

where the company's located#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's streams and water and things I don't understand. Trees and the gulf#Other

So tell me about where you live.#Action-directive
Well, um, I'm, I'm originally from Butler#Statement-non-opinion
and that's about an hour away from where I am now.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm at Clairon.#Statement-non-opinion
And, um, it's, it's pretty, like, windy and hilly.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, how high is the highest elevation?#Wh-Question
Oh, I couldn't even tell you.#Statement-non-opinion
Like, uh, probably#Uninterpretable
It's not like a mountain.#Statement-non-opinion
It wouldn't be like a mountain.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, uh,#Uninterpretable
three thousand feet?#Declarative Yes-No-Question

uh, right here in Colorado Springs where I live#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's over six thousand foot.#Other
Oh, well, see, um,#Uninterpretable
Um, yes#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when I lived in Texas, every year I had to drive, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
I drove every year to the gulf#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, so I could have a feast of fresh seafood#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
six, eight, twelve hours away.#Other
Um.#Uninterpretable
You know, just, just for fresh.#Other
I, I'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of America.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How many hours have you been from home?#Wh-Question
Uh, the farthest away from home?#Declarative Yes-No-Question

Probab-, I'd say five or six.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Uh, now when I was growing up in the Panhandle of Texas,#Statement-non-opinion
look at your map later and see the, the town of Amarillo#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
fifty miles north of that up in the Panhandle.#Other
To just go buy a pair of jeans, we'd drive an hour.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my#Appreciation
Oh, my Gosh.#Appreciation
When I was growing up,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now things are different#Other
and people buy jeans in town,#Statement-non-opinion
but uh, we thought nothing at all of wake up, waking up in the morning hopping into your car, grabbing the fishing poles and driving four hours.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Appreciation
Now see for me, that's a long ways.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
It is I imagine.#Appreciation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Even, well, like, I, I'm in like a little town right now.#Statement-non-opinion
It's smaller than Butler#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, Butler, Butler is about an hour north east of Pittsburgh.#Statement-non-opinion
So that will give you some idea of where I'm at.#Statement-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I'm about,#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'll look at my map later.#Offers, Options Commits
I'm about two hours north east of Pittsburgh.#Other
Wow.#Appreciation
How neat.#Appreciation
And, uh, I mean just this, this little town here is basically a college town.#Statement-non-opinion
The college, without the college here, this town would be nothing.#Statement-non-opinion
It would be absolutely dead.#Statement-non-opinion
Because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants#Statement-non-opinion
and, and in the summer when we co-, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
my fianc3ee's family lives up there, *#Statement-non-opinion
we come up here in the summer,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's,#Uninterpretable
I mean, there's just no one around.#Statement-non-opinion
So are you working your way through college?#Yes-No-Question
Um, well, I go home in the summer#Statement-non-opinion

and between what I make in the summer and student loans, that's how I go to college.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, how neat.#Appreciation
What's your major?#Wh-Question
Finance.#Statement-non-opinion
Finance.#Repeat-phrase
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, that's interesting.#Appreciation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, what do you plan to do with it?#Wh-Question
Um, well, like I said my fianc3ee, - *#Statement-non-opinion
Savings and loans, uh,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No#No answers
No,#No answers
no,#No answers
no,#No answers
um, my fianc3ee works down in D C *#Statement-non-opinion
and I'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or a, something.#Statement-non-opinion
I'd rather work for a company and, um, like be their financial advisor or something.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that would be great.#Appreciation
That would be neat#Appreciation
Let's see, uh, so we're all excited in Colorado Springs.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Apple Computer is coming to town.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yes.#Yes answers
The, uh, new employer is in the city.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So we're expecting our local economy to#Statement-non-opinion
Take a boom a little bit.#Collaborative Completion
Well, maybe not a boom, but, uh, at least, recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still.#Other
Well, well what would be the unemployment rate out there?#Wh-Question
Uh, unemployment runs approximately six percent.#Statement-non-opinion
See that's what it is here too.#Statement-non-opinion
But, now under employment I would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
It is.#Statement-opinion
I know people they are out of school for two or three years#Statement-non-opinion
and they have a job that has nothing to do ...#Statement-non-opinion

Okay,#Other
what kind of car are you going to buy next?#Wh-Question
Well, one of the cars I'm thinking about buying next is, uh, a nice, safe, small car,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, uh, the reason being, is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a big family,#Other
and we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so forth,#Other
and we have another four door car that I drive to work,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it'd be more economical if I were able to a smaller car#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, wouldn't be, wouldn't cost much with gas.#Other
That's true,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
What, what are you looking at?#Wh-Question
Well, I'm really not looking at anything for a while,#Dispreferred answers
but#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out,#Other
and you think, Oh, well, maybe, maybe I would like a new car.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I think I'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
oh, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh.#Uninterpretable
Well, the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
they are.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
I sure do like the looks of that new Mit-, Mitsubishi Diamante.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
oh, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That is a pretty car.#Statement-opinion
I'm, uh, I really like the looks also of the new Mazda#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's pretty, too.#Statement-opinion
that they have,#Other
but um, I, uh, you know, the, the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they get pretty expensive.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
they do.#Agree/Accept
The last one I bought, I bought a, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
well, it's a, it's a Town Car,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was a demo, returned#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I got it with like, you know, I think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and nearly ten thousand dollars of-, less than what the list price was.#Other
Well, you can't go wrong with that kind of opportunity.#Statement-opinion
So I was really pleased to find that,#Statement-non-opinion
and I then, I bought it for cheaper,#Statement-non-opinion
I was looking at a Honda Accord, a brand new one#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I bought this, uh, the, the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what I was going to buy the new Honda Accord.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
Well, you get a much bigger, better#Statement-opinion
And the thing about it is#Statement-non-opinion
comfortable ride.#Other
they give you that ten, uh,#Other
.#Non-verbal
that hundred thousand mi-, mile, five year warranty#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where it only costs you twenty-five dollars to have anything repaired.#Other
Well, that's fantastic.#Appreciation
That's real, real good.#Appreciation
So, uh, I have really been impressed.#Statement-non-opinion
I said, I probably never be able,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to find another one that I can afford, you know.#Other
No,#Agree/Accept
do you,#Uninterpretable
But I have loved this car better than anything I've ever driven, because you can go on the road and get there#Statement-non-opinion
and you're not even tired.#Statement-non-opinion
Very comfortable, smooth ride, huh.#Yes-No-Question
And it gets like twenty-six miles to the gallon on the road.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, it does?#Backchannel in question form
It sure does.#Affirmative non-yes answers
That's, that's unbelievable for that size of car.#Statement-opinion
I, they kept telling me that,#Statement-non-opinion
and I thought they're crazy,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
so the week after I got it, well, actually before I signed the papers on it, I took it over to Boozier City#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it did it.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
That's great.#Appreciation
But it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
That's great.#Appreciation
That kind of gas mileage, uh, we're, we're kind of hoping for on our van.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, that's kind of what we've always been told, you know, they'll do,#Statement-non-opinion
and then we hope for it,#Statement-non-opinion
and it never happens#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it really, it does get good gas mileage.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's excellent.#Appreciation
Most of the time when I don't go anywhere I can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work, you know, and then fill it up,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you, uh, do, does it, uh, need a lot of repairs?#Yes-No-Question
Is it a very reliable kind of car?#Yes-No-Question
I haven't had anything,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I've taken it in twice for like just really minor things,#Statement-non-opinion
and it cost me the twenty-five dollars.#Statement-non-opinion
The, uh, really something really silly when we first got it,#Statement-non-opinion
we couldn't get the light,#Statement-non-opinion
they have all these lights in the car#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we couldn't get the light to turn off.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we kept trying, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and we went out to dinner with some friends,#Statement-non-opinion
and it stayed on all night, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Oh dear.#Appreciation
just shining right down on them, you know#Other
Oh dear#Appreciation
and we couldn't get it to turn off,#Statement-non-opinion
and the next day my husband goes out there#Statement-non-opinion
and he tries to get it off,#Statement-non-opinion
we turn the knob, you know, in the front that's supposed to turn the#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
lights on and off#Other
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we turned everything we could,#Other
and he took it in,#Statement-non-opinion
and they said, you know, you just have to press the switch.#Statement-non-opinion
He says, I've pressed every switch in that car,#Statement-non-opinion
and I can't get the light off,#Quotation
.#Non-verbal
it's broken.#Quotation
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So they took it in and charged us the twenty-five dollars,#Statement-non-opinion
and they called and told us though, that all you have to do is turn the off switch,#Statement-non-opinion
and they showed us where the switch was.#Statement-non-opinion
They charged you twenty-five dollars just to tell you that, huh.#Summarize/reformulate
They, they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
oh, so they probably went through the,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
But he hadn't, he hadn't done the right one.#Statement-non-opinion
I see#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's right on the arm rest in the back#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we didn't know it was there.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car#Statement-non-opinion
And found it right away.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
and so we thought, you know, there, there was, it was broken.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But we've had just, uh,#Uninterpretable
I guess it's been in two times.#Statement-non-opinion
I've had it three years now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, it's been in two, maybe three times.#Statement-non-opinion
But it's just been real minor things.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I think that, uh, you have an excellent deal then,#Statement-opinion
and the, the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all,#Statement-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
That's right.#Agree/Accept
But it's really, it's been an enjoyable car.#Statement-non-opinion
Like I say, I'll probably never be able to have another one, because I think we bought it for about sixteen thousand, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yes#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I said, I'll never find another one for that price.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
not at all.#Agree/Accept
And they keep going up,#Statement-opinion
so I'll have to enjoy it,#Statement-non-opinion

Uh, let's see.#Hold before answer/agreement
Personal computers.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, do you use them?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, yes,#Yes answers
um, we own one.#Statement-non-opinion
Terrific.#Appreciation
What kind?#Wh-Question
Uh, its an Emerson eighty eighty-six, um, two low density floppy drives, and no hard drive yet.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, you know, it's, it comes in mighty handy.#Statement-non-opinion
Mostly for word processing type things?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, yeah,#Yes answers
a big chunk of it's word processing.#Statement-non-opinion
We're also taking programming classes,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, so there's a fair amount of programming getting done on it.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, uh, the, uh,#Uninterpretable
right now we got a project going where we're trying to put, uh, all my wife's stray recipes on the disk.#Statement-non-opinion
Nice.#Appreciation
Did you buy a program to handle menus?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, it came with a menus program,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, that doesn't,#Uninterpretable
it, it basi-,#Uninterpretable
both, excuse me,#Uninterpretable
mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Appreciation
and hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured.#Statement-non-opinion
Eighty eighty-eight is what you said?#Signal-non-understanding
Eighty eighty-six.#Statement-non-opinion
Eighty,#Repeat-phrase
oh gosh, it's worth your time to just upgrade,#Statement-opinion
they're so darned cheap now.#Statement-opinion
Which,#Wh-Question
Computers.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, impoverished college student.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
This one went on a credit card,#Statement-non-opinion
and we got a way out, while to pay it off yet.#Statement-non-opinion
So it's, * B's next turn is not a continuation of this.#Other
Uh, I've, I've got one at home too.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a three eighty-six, thirty-three megahertz, forty, four meg ram and hundred and thirty meg drive#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's sounds nice. *#Other
super V G A#Other
and, yeah, it's fun.#Statement-non-opinion
I do programming, too.#Statement-non-opinion
My job is, uh, E D P auditor,#Statement-non-opinion
and so I'm into computers all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
E D P.#Repeat-phrase
Electronic Data Processing.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
that sounds like fun job.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I really enjoy it,#Statement-non-opinion
and it treats me well.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, what are you studying in college#Yes-No-Question
Uh.#Statement-non-opinion
computers?#Other
Computer engineering.#Other
How nice.#Appreciation
Well, computer engineering technology, uh, which, uh, all I can understand is it's a slightly more hands on version of computer engineering.#Statement-non-opinion
But, I've got a ways to go yet.#Statement-non-opinion
So far most of what I've done is getting, gotten core classes out of the way,#Statement-non-opinion
taken some electronics classes, and one class in, um, with computer logic.#Statement-non-opinion
How they work is fascinating to me.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
I enjoy it myself#Statement-non-opinion
The, uh, lab for that, uh, computer logic class was a lot of fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Was it.#Backchannel in question form
Did, di-,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Yes answers
we got to hook up a few, uh, counters and, uh, deco-, encoders.#Statement-non-opinion
Hardware stuff, huh.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
What do you think of that fuzzy logic?#Open-Question
I've not had a chance to work with it, although, um, my, uh, data structures teacher was telling us something about how fuz-, fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now how you'd implement that software wise or mechanically I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, it sounds like a very impressive piece of, piece of work.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're pretty amazing.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I've written a couple of programs for, commercially, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's a fun field.#Statement-non-opinion
In the fuzzy logic direction?#Yes-No-Question
What,#Signal-non-understanding
no,#No answers
in, uh,#Uninterpretable
no,#No answers
just regular, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
but you have to take into account, you know, with any computer program all the type of things people can do to you to make your program crash or things you#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
normally don't consider.#Other
Entering bad information of one sort or another#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
pushing keys certain times and,#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, messing up your files and things like that.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you're going to be an engineer, computer engineer type.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh, yeah,#Yes answers
well, what the computer, what the C E T program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from,#Statement-non-opinion
you get programming, a fair amount of programming,#Statement-non-opinion
you get hardware,#Statement-non-opinion
you get, uh, more or less, uh, you get basic electronics courses that, uh, deal with, you know, not only the digital circuitry but, uh, you know, power supplies and, and, uh, just the whole gambit, but mostly towards, uh, computer electronics.#Statement-non-opinion
So, the idea is that, um, you can go in a variety of direction from C E T major,#Statement-non-opinion
but I sa-, I have more with the hardware than I do with the software,#Statement-non-opinion
so, yeah#Uninterpretable
I#Statement-non-opinion
I don't,#Uninterpretable
pretty much plan on, I mean, so far I'm planning to go in the engineering direction.#Other
That's good, uh,#Appreciation

Here we go.#Other
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, now we're supposed to talk about social activities.#Yes-No-Question
Right?#Tag-Question
Well, the changes that's occurred,#Dispreferred answers
like it, how was it, maybe ten, twenty, thirty years ago as opposed to what it is today#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
how we're living socially in comparison to maybe from that time period from ten, twenty, or whatever you remember it to be.#Statement-non-opinion
I think, um, well, I guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation.#Statement-opinion
I think your generation is, um,#Statement-opinion
what do I say, uh,#Self-talk
uh, they're, they're, they're polite,#Statement-opinion
they have more respect for,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
other people, just in, in general I think, and just, just towards people and property#Other
and, um, I, I guess they would, would be more conservative, some of them I guess.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
we are, uh, somewhat conservative,#Agree/Accept
but as far as the, uh, socially, our crime rate has increased,#Statement-opinion
and although it's more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
violent crime is on the increase from what I've seen,#Other
and, um, our prison population has significantly increased I would say.#Statement-opinion
Um, our economy, too, is really, it's just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what I've read,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, even the,#Other
well, it started spiraling down, I suppose, in the seventies,#Statement-opinion
and, uh, our recovery, uh, economically has not been like it used to be.#Statement-opinion
To me, also, our nuclear family is not the same because more people are living together#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that aren't married#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I don't, I don't know if, uh,#Uninterpretable
can't make any judgments of that nature,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I don't really want to either#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
because I have no problems about it either way#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, kids are, I, I suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to#Statement-opinion
Yes, I agree with,#Agree/Accept
women are more on the rise too#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so far as getting their careers established,#Other
and, uh, they don't#Statement-opinion
Well,#Yes-No-Question
no longer feel dependent upon men,#Other
Well, do you think that that maybe,#Other
I mean, uh, I've heard different, you know, like, um, like#Statement-non-opinion
I know my mom and like other ladies, they complain because they think that, um, the women now are too busy with their own personal life and career that they really don't have time for their kids.#Statement-non-opinion
That's probably true,#Agree/Accept
I mean, they, they are, a lot of them that have to put their kids into day care#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or having more with baby sitters,#Other
and, especially if they don't have boy friends or husbands,#Statement-opinion
and, uh, I guess that's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, in fact, uh, there was one lady in this area,#Statement-non-opinion
she was caught going to work and leaving her daughter in her car all day.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh my gosh, just a baby.#Appreciation
Not a baby, she was old enough to, uh,#Reject
I would say she was five to eight years old#Statement-non-opinion
Oh my gosh.#Appreciation
somewhere along that range,#Other
but that's just an extreme example.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I would imagine, you know, the situations are out there.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um,#Uninterpretable
Well, um, um, well, I think the education, like our education has, um, increased dramatically,#Statement-opinion
but then I think also that we're forgetting like basic things, like we should know#Statement-opinion
I agree there.#Agree/Accept
like I, I think, well, um, in the morals and values of like my generation for the most, for most people are totally different from the morals and valleys, um, values of like per se your generation.#Statement-opinion
But I think as we get older, it gets to your, you know what I mean.#Statement-opinion
I think the kids now are, are, I would say, louder now until after they reach like twenty-five,#Statement-opinion
and then I think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
um, I could agree with that, because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
because I think we're given more now, whereas you had to work for everything,#Statement-opinion
and kids nowadays are just given so much that they really don't have to work,#Statement-opinion
and, you know, and they, they don't have any intent to go working until they have to.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
that's an agreeable topic there#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Um, what else considering beside family, economics, um,#Self-talk
our transportation system has changed for us.#Statement-opinion
I mean, we can, we can now travel around the world in no time.#Statement-opinion
It's just a hop, skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, well, I, I think what's happened, too, is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that, and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up, aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and to keep abreast of the knowledge out there, we got to constantly read, go to school, uh,#Statement-opinion
T V watching has sure hasn't gone too much out the door because T V is still, well,#Statement-opinion
the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular T V programming and watch a lot of other, a variety of programs out there, as well as use of the V C R#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that, I don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education system.#Or-Clause
I don't know, because I know I don't watch, while I'm up here at school, I don't watch hardly any T V.#Other answers
Like Thursday night I like to sit down and watch a few shows,#Statement-non-opinion
but I,#Uninterpretable
Do you watch L A LAW?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I don't watch that#Statement-non-opinion
I used to,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't any more.#Statement-non-opinion
I like that.#Statement-non-opinion
But, all,#Uninterpretable
I mean there are, even though there's a few up here, we call them couch potatoes,#Statement-non-opinion
they love to sit in front of the T V,#Statement-non-opinion
I#Uninterpretable
but for the most part, I will, I will,#Statement-non-opinion
well, I live in an all girls dorm,#Statement-non-opinion
but for the most part we're all between the ages of eighteen and like twenty-one#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and there isn't really a lot of T V watching.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's good,#Appreciation
at least you're hitting the books, right.#Yes-No-Question
They're either hitting the books or something else,#Dispreferred answers
I don't know what,#Statement-non-opinion
but, I know, oh, well, I guess, they have their crowds, like during the soap operas, you know, like in between classes or something#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I can't say that there's really that many people that like sit in front of the T V all day.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's a change then,#Appreciation
oh, of course, going to school, too, it's different from the home environment,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
but, then, um, like I know this girl.#Statement-non-opinion
She's doing her student teaching#Statement-non-opinion
or she's just working like within the school,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, yesterday she was at the kindergarten,#Statement-non-opinion
and there's this little boy,#Statement-non-opinion
he like didn't want to do anything,#Statement-non-opinion
and he said I'm not doing this,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't like it,#Quotation
and he sat at his desk with two pencils in his hand, and pretend like he's playing Nintendo#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
so, uh, I don't know how,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I never really watched that, a lot of T V when I was younger,#Statement-non-opinion
but my parents really didn't allow us to watch that much T V,#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't know.#Hedge
I agree with your parents,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
because, uh, T V kind of ruined me,#Other
because that's that's all that we had#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, not really,#Reject
but, I mean, it's, uh, for the top medium of entertainment.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well, we watch a lot of, I guess we watched a lot of T V in the Winter time,#Statement-non-opinion
but in the Summer, like right now, my mom, well, like she doesn't let us watch T V until like eight o'clock at night, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Even at your age?#Yes-No-Question
Well, like my younger brothers and sisters at home.#Dispreferred answers
Like when it starts#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
getting nice outside in the Summer and everything#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she'll, she makes us go outside,#Other
even now when I go home for the Summer, she makes us go outside,#Statement-non-opinion
and we're allowed to come in and watch T V until it's dark, because she doesn't like the T V herself#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Response Acknowledgement
and if it was up to her, we wouldn't have one.#Statement-non-opinion
So, you know, she feels that kids are too dependent on it also.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh. Is there anything else?#Yes-No-Question
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What about in our work ethics?#Open-Question
Work ethics, oh,#Repeat-phrase
I,#Uninterpretable
It's get-, it's maybe getting better. Um, a little,#Statement-opinion
of course, we-, we-, we're having to weather through the savings and loans#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
all the other scandalous items that, well, the greed that overwhelmed us in the eighties#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I think, I think it's going to have to have it's patchwork put on us#Statement-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because we have so much to pay for now.#Other
It's going to be really passed on to your generation and maybe a few others#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
including what's left of ours#Other
Well, I really can't think of anything else.#Conventional-closing
Well, it was nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
It was nice talking to you too.#Conventional-closing
And, uh, what are majoring in?#Wh-Question

So how do you feel about it?#Open-Question
Uh, I, I don't see any problem with, with testing for random drugs.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, myself, almost, uh, am in favor of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I work at Honeywell#Statement-non-opinion
and I went through a, a pretty, I don't know, I went through a, standard drug testing thing before I, I was brought on.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's pretty standard.#Statement-non-opinion
At least at Honeywell it is.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I think it's important to insure the quality and, and, uh, I don't know, almost the goodness of character. You know#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that kind of thing.#Other
Where do you work?#Wh-Question
Uh, well I'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon.#Dispreferred answers
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
And I, I just came from Saint Paul.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, interviewing with Three M.#Other
Oh, great.#Appreciation
And, uh, they have a policy for, uh, testing.#Statement-non-opinion
If you, if they make you an offer, then they'll test you right before you start.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I guess the only drawback I can see to, to drug testing is in, in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some, uh, sort of false positive result#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then there could#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
be some sort of problem.#Other
But i-,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
And that, that definitely happens, you know.#Agree/Accept
I mean those, the drug tests, sure they're accurate#Statement-opinion
but there's always that margin of error.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's, that's something to be aware of.#Statement-opinion
Another thing is, a lot of times, you know, they aren't that accurate.#Statement-opinion
They aren't that sensitive.#Statement-opinion
Like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind, you know, what are they going to do about that#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for Honeywell#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, uh, you know, I know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I'm sure they screen for just a particular few types.#Statement-opinion
Although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this#Statement-non-opinion
and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I don't know.#Hedge
What, what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon?#Wh-Question
Uh, electrical engineering.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Great.#Appreciation
Uh, yeah,#Uninterpretable
I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida. University of Central Florida.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow .#Appreciation
And this is actually a an internship up here.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But, uh, they, uh, even for interns they, they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
They test you, uh, before they, before you start or before you even#Yes-No-Question
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
interview#Other
or,#Uninterpretable
Uh, they essentially,#Uninterpretable
no#No answers
I sure don't uh,#3rd-party-talk
they essentially, uh, they essentially, uh, made me the offer and then, and then, uh, did the drug testing thing after that.#Statement-non-opinion
So, uh, it was one of those things where you go through the, the general battery of all their tests#Statement-non-opinion
and, and then, they essentially give you the offer#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then at that point they'll, they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
So, uh, there's some noise on this end.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm actually in a mall calling#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You probably wondered, huh.#Yes-No-Question
But,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Yes answers
Wh-, what happens if you were to fail?#Wh-Question
Then do they give you like one ch-, one more chance or two more chances?#Or-Clause
Yes.#Yes answers
That's a good question.#Appreciation
I believe from what I remember of the literature they gave, uh, if you fail I believe they give you one more chance.#Statement-non-opinion
They probably give you a chance to explain yourself#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then maybe give you another chance to go through it.#Other
But, uh, you know, once again, those things are not that accurate#Statement-opinion
so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail, you know.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, wha-,#Uninterpretable
are you working right now anywhere#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Uh, no.#No answers
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
I'm just about to finish my Master's in May and, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Great.#Appreciation
just interviewing with companies right now.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening, you know. Was, was going to Honeywell.#Statement-non-opinion
A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he's doing an internship with I B M.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, they, basically, uh, did the same exact thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, we both got our internships at the same time#Statement-non-opinion
and we both had to go through drug testing at the same time.#Statement-non-opinion
So, one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Did, do they test you at, right now, at work too?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
no.#No answers
That's#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
one thing they don't do is, is drug testing while you're on the job.#Other
Uh, I think, I think the unwritten rule is, yeah, expect it#Statement-non-opinion
but they don't do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Response Acknowledgement
You know, so. That's good I guess.#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
I mean, I, uh, I have gone to a couple of parties since, since that time#Statement-non-opinion
and while I don't do any drugs myself, I've seen some people who work there, uh, you know, smoking a joint or whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, you know, that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
But no,#No answers
they don't, they don't really do that.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Wow.#Appreciation
Is it formal policy that they said they might test?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah#Yes answers

Uh, I've had, uh, three boys through, I guess, uh, some child care, each one of them#Statement-non-opinion
and now they're in school#Statement-non-opinion
so it's all over#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I guess I would say it's not easy to find wha-, what most parents would want.#Statement-opinion
Well I can profit by this because I'm due with my first in about three months.#Statement-non-opinion
Is that right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess, uh, the only rule, uh, I can think of is that I like to look for places with, uh, good respectable, nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
If they're associated with a college or a university, they're usually a pretty good bet.#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something.#Statement-opinion
You'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care.#Statement-opinion
I guess not,#Agree/Accept
usu-,#Uninterpretable
I suppose you're absolutely right there.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
For profit#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
places, I would really look at them awfully carefully#Other
but, uh, when I was when my kids were young, I was teaching at a university#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, the child care center associated with our university was quite good#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I felt confident that they'd do right.#Other
Of,#Uninterpretable
aren't don't they kind of use them for, everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs? For their per-, for their pet theories or some such thing?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, you mean, uh, learning type, uh, yeah ?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
I mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission.#Other
But, yeah,#Yes answers
I suppose, uh, if you're, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another,#Statement-opinion
I guess that's true.#Agree/Accept
But, uh, I never had bad experience in that respect#Statement-non-opinion
Of course, you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents,#Statement-non-opinion
and they, you know,#Uninterpretable
pretty good people#Statement-opinion
Um. Well, the thing I really worry about is, uh, the sexual abuse cases you read about.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I mean you'd just feel awful if something like that happened.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I never really worry very much about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public#Statement-non-opinion
so, I#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
never really worried too much about that being, uh, uh, the case with my boys.#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I, you know, I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them#Statement-opinion
but#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't think it's as common as, uh, the newspapers would make you believe#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And another thing is cost.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah#Agree/Accept
I mean that,#Agree/Accept
I know so many of my friends I went to school with who are having babies right now#Statement-non-opinion
and they finding, in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, in our case, we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were, uh, in school.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'm really happy we did it, although it was very, very difficult.#Statement-non-opinion
And#Statement-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it was the right thing to do#Other
and we were, uh, we just decided that we would do it#Statement-non-opinion
and we went ahead#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, not everybody can make that choice#Statement-opinion
and even, even though my wife wasn't working, we did have, uh, one or another of the boys in, uh, child care for part-ti-, just for part of the day. Uh, or a couple of days a week just so that, uh, other things could get done around the house and so on,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, we did look around.#Other
I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Huh .#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I would always trust her judgment on that.#Other
Huh. Well I'm just thanking heaven.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband just got a new job.#Statement-non-opinion
His last company, he was only working four days a week.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's,#Uninterpretable
and he just got a new job.#Statement-non-opinion
He's getting lots of overtime,#Statement-non-opinion
he got a pay raise#Statement-non-opinion
and so I'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not.#Statement-non-opinion
There's absolutely no question that you're going to be the best child care provider for that kid#Statement-opinion
so, yeah, do it as long you can#Action-directive
I suppose.#Agree/Accept
But I think, you know, you have to look through a place#Statement-opinion
and you have to get a feel for, uh, how they treat the kids and, uh, uh, what kind of staff members they have and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
how much turnover they have and things like that before you#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
commit your child to them.#Other
And I think you have, the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open. That you're welcome anytime without notice, in the middle of the day and so forth#Statement-opinion
and if they're at all queasy about that then#Statement-opinion
You have to start wondering if they don't want you.#Collaborative Completion
I'd look elsewhere, yeah.#Other
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You have other friends that have kids, uh, being taken care of in, uh, child care?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, I have one#Affirmative non-yes answers
but I haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So. But, I really think the news reports are, uh, tend to sensationalize the problems.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and, uh, pay and exhaustion and#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know, things like that, rather than these, uh, uh, really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy.#Other
This is true.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
CURRENT AFFAIR can#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
get several shows child cases.#Other
Uh-huh. Well,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Yes,#Other
um, how do you feel about, um, the way the U S has reacted in the Middle East?#Open-Question
Well, I was, it was favorable.#Dispreferred answers
I, I just, I think, the sanctions would have worked,#Statement-opinion
but it would of taken longer#Statement-opinion
and, uh, now with all this stuff coming out with Woodward's book and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and then I saw a NIGHTLINE program last night about all the funding of Hussein's, uh, back as early as nineteen eighty-six,#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh, been a different turn,#Statement-opinion
and then I don't think we projected what was going to happen after the war,#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It got over so fast,#Statement-opinion
so, uh,#Uninterpretable
What is the Woodward book you are referring to?#Wh-Question
Well, it just came out, I guess, yesterday.#Statement-non-opinion
It's called the COMMANDERS.#Statement-non-opinion
And it's, uh, it says, big story in the paper about it today, Bush trying to comment on it, that Colin Powell was against the, uh, uh, an early, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
he was for sanctions.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so it seems like there's, you know, always some body digging things like that.#Statement-opinion
But, I'm not for sure we know exactly what, what all happened in that situation,#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, we were so, uh, fast to get over the Vietnam, whatever the Vietnam syndrome is, that now we've tied ourselves up there in the Middle East for a long period of time.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
That was my feeling.#Statement-non-opinion
I was, I was very against our involvement so quickly.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just think, I think if we had been very, I mean if we had that good of a correlation through the United Nations, then they could have, uh, they could have made sanctions work, I'm pretty sure.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Agree/Accept
Huh-uh.#Agree/Accept
With that much support, you would have just penalized any nation that broke the embargo,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
I think we're very naive as far as that part of the world is concerned.#Statement-opinion
We are.#Agree/Accept
We are, I think, you know,#Agree/Accept
in, in, we've just misread almost everything in that we always seem to be getting in bad with the wrong fellow for the next, next tenure, for the next thing down the road#Statement-opinion
and, uh, then, we can, and we don't tend to read Israel correctly#Statement-opinion
so, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
it should be a mess.#Statement-opinion
It's, uh, not going to be anything we're going to get out of very soon.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Right.#Agree/Accept
In spite of all the promises.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
They can talk a good game,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, being a historian, it's, you know, you read all that clear back at least to the turn of the century with all the mess after the first world war,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we just, we're still, I, I you're absolutely right,#Agree/Accept
too naive,#Agree/Accept
we just, if we do find so-called experts in any area of the world, we don't listen to them#Statement-opinion
so,#Hedge
Huh-uh.#Agree/Accept
Huh-uh.#Agree/Accept
Um, I don't know,#Other
be, be interesting to keep watching I guess,#Statement-opinion
but I'm just afraid it's going, it's going,#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to break us.#Other
And I'm not sure we're sensitive to, to other cultures.#Statement-opinion
Not very much in our colleges,#Statement-opinion
we're trying,#Statement-opinion
we're, I happen to teach at a college with a tremendous number of international students#Statement-non-opinion
and, and cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand#Statement-opinion
and it needs to be, uh, taught from the earliest grades,#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with our school systems in such disarray, I don't know, if that, it doesn't look terribly hopeful.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Agree/Accept
But I'm not sure it's something you can teach.#Statement-opinion
I mean,#Statement-opinion
Well, you can at least, uh,#Statement-opinion
awareness.#Other
give them the awareness of the different cultures and, uh, you know, have all sorts of, um, at least, you know, let them know what that, that other people do things differently than, than, than maybe in their own neighborhood.#Other
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, and when, when, when those people are around#Statement-opinion
and you can get them to meet#Statement-opinion
and we're all pretty much alike,#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
That's true.#Agree/Accept
So, uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it's, uh, it's something as, you know, as I said won't go away,#Other
so it will be a good topic for me in the class for along time#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Because I teach history,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, what about the whole situation with the refugees, the Kurds?#Open-Question
Well, I would just think if Bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war, then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the United Nations to, uh, uh, somehow persuade those nations to give the Kurds a homeland#Statement-opinion
they were promised that .#Statement-opinion
But, what about the Palestinians?#Open-Question
Well, that's the same thing,#Statement-opinion
they, uh, they haven't been waiting quite as long, even though they've been waiting since forty-eight,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, that, that becomes a different matter simply because your dealing with Israel#Statement-opinion
and they seem to be more intractable than ever.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, that Shamir can't, can't retain his leadership if he, if he backs down the slightest bit#Statement-opinion
so, uh, I just don't see us, I don't think there's anybody of, of major stature on the scene of, like the great statesman of the past,#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Agree/Accept
Huh-uh#Agree/Accept
or at least we thought they were.#Statement-opinion
I'm not for sure that they were.#Statement-opinion
They seem to have gotten us into some of these messes.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Agree/Accept
Well, do you think the U S should even be involved? I mean, as the world leader in the sense trying to resolve these issues#Yes-No-Question
or should we have just stayed out of it?#Or-Clause
Well, I wish we could stay out of it,#Statement-opinion
but the oil is not going to allow us to.#Statement-opinion
We absolutely need that oil.#Statement-opinion
That's the major thing.#Statement-opinion
If we didn't need the oil and if we didn't have the ties with the Israelis, we could probably stay out of it.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Right.#Agree/Accept
Right.#Agree/Accept
But I'm not for sure that we're not destined, at least for the foreseeable future, as long as we can keep our head, our own head above water, to be the world leader.#Statement-opinion
So I, Bush is probably, if he can keep that correlation together, especially the French, and the British, and the Germans, and be sure that the Japanese can kick in some of their money.#Statement-opinion
They may just have to,#Statement-opinion
I don't know what type of pressure they can put on all the nations there, too, because now that the war is over, societies have just about gone back to their own,#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, uh, cold selves.#Other
And I wouldn't have necessarily fought for the Kuwaitis,#Statement-non-opinion
they, uh, they're, nobody likes them in that part of the world#Statement-opinion
but, uh, it's just such a volatile area,#Statement-opinion
I mean, there's just no stability, period.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
But in a sense, I don't know that I would say it's good,#Statement-non-opinion
in a sense I'm glad that Saudi wasn't more changed by, by the situation#Statement-non-opinion
because,#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, we really don't, I mean, I don't think, it's our world to westernize the whole world,#Other
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
so the fact that the Saudi could just sort of pull back and, uh, remain, you know, culturally sort of clean is interesting.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I think you're right.#Agree/Accept
I, it's not our, uh, role to make everybody like us.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Agree/Accept
But, it's just, uh, for those who have, may have wanted to travel in that part of the world that are up in the age I am, it's going to eliminate that for awhile.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Right.#Agree/Accept
I think it's going to be too dangerous to be any place in there.#Statement-opinion
Well, you know, I mean, I actually lived in Beirut from sixty-eight to eighty-four#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, did you?#Backchannel in question form
And so, I mean, it's been dangerous for sometime.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
I'm not sure that it's changed that much.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well, I, I haven't been to Beirut#Statement-non-opinion
but I've heard what a wonderful city that,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just totally gone to, uh,#Statement-opinion
Well, see that's it.#Appreciation
It really hasn't.#Reject
It hasn't .#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
it depends on whether one talks physical or, or sort of cultural.#Statement-non-opinion
Culturally, I mean, it's obviously changed a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Because it's more of a survival city ,#Statement-non-opinion
but the buildings are still intact and still beautiful, you know, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
There was garbage on the corner when I got there#Statement-non-opinion
and there's garbage when I left.#Statement-non-opinion
But I mean, it's just a different cultural aspect.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, the trucks don't come daily#Statement-non-opinion
and you really don't want the garbage in your house,#Statement-non-opinion
so. And, I mean, I traveled in the area, too.#Statement-non-opinion
And, um, so that many of the countries Turkey and Syria are the same as they were for traveling.#Statement-non-opinion
That's one part of the world,#Uninterpretable
I've been to north Africa a lot but not, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't been to Beirut or Syria or Baghdad,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was never able to go to Baghdad.#Statement-non-opinion
It was, I never could get a visa.#Statement-non-opinion
So even before, so even when things were good in the Middle East, Americans weren't really given visas to go into Baghdad.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, but it's, it's a very beautiful part, very interesting historically, of course, which was my interest art history.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, I think we've done them a good job today then.#Conventional-closing
.#Non-verbal
For this little project they're doing.#Other
Right.#Conventional-closing
Right.#Conventional-closing
In fact, I just talked to the director awhile ago,#Conventional-closing
so, uh, he was checking to see if I was going to stay in because I've been so busy with this presidential search,#Conventional-closing
I haven't had a chance to,#Conventional-closing
Huh-uh.#Conventional-closing
really do any calling myself.#Other
Huh-uh.#Conventional-closing

Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
enjoyed it, just really liked it#Other
Well, I've heard a lot of good things about it.#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I'm trying to think,#Hold before answer/agreement
we went to see a, uh, a real funny one,#Statement-non-opinion
I can't think now what the name of it was#Statement-non-opinion
Was it,#Other
I've gone blank.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, we, my wife and I went and saw a couple of funny ones.#Other
We saw THE NAKED GUN, TWO AND A HALF#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, we have not seen that,#Statement-non-opinion

and then we saw,#Statement-non-opinion
what was the spoof on TOP GUN,#Other
it's#Uninterpretable
Oh, I haven't seen that one.#Statement-non-opinion
oh, I can't think of what that was called.#Statement-non-opinion
We saw that too,#Statement-non-opinion
tha-,#Uninterpretable
I was pretty disappointed in that one.#Statement-non-opinion
Were you.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but, uh, so, you know, through the summer,#Uninterpretable
we have small children, so we don't get to see too many, but we've seen I guess two or three movies this past summer.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them,#Statement-non-opinion
he likes to rent them#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so we watch a lot of them, you know, at home#Statement-non-opinion

as they come out,#Other
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Have you seen GHOSTS yet?#Yes-No-Question

Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I was really disappointed in it,#Statement-non-opinion
it was-,#Uninterpretable
one,#Uninterpretable
I don't think it was as funny as what I was an-, anticipating,#Statement-opinion
and I guess I was expecting it to be kind of funny#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well,#Uninterpretable
and, uh, and it wasn't#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, at all,#Other
it was, it was more of a love story#Statement-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
real well.#Other
We just got through watching one with, uh, uh, is it Claude Van Damme#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, Van Damme,#Collaborative Completion

lots of blood and guts and all that#Other

Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that was one that, that stayed with me#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, for a month,#Other
I just,#Uninterpretable
I kept thinking about it, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, it's amazing,#Statement-opinion
but really, I mean, when you stop and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
and yet it was his character that was so intriguing,#Statement-opinion
Oh, it was excellent,#Statement-opinion
and, and, of course, he's such a, uh, very good actor anyway#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, I think he made the movie,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I do too,#Agree/Accept
I really did#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, Jody Foster was good, too, but I think, I think Anthony Perkins was the one that, that really made the movie,#Statement-opinion
I agree with you.#Agree/Accept
Is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins?#Or-Clause
Oh, Hopkins,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sorry#Apology
Hopkins,#Repeat-phrase

I'm not a real big Jody Foster fan,#Statement-non-opinion

Well, I agr-,#Uninterpretable
well, I haven't been,#Uninterpretable
I'm, I saw her in THE KEYS,#Statement-non-opinion
and I thought that was a pretty good movie,#Statement-non-opinion
but I thought she,#Statement-opinion
Now, I didn't see that one.#Uninterpretable
That was, that was pretty interesting movie,#Statement-opinion
and, uh, but, you know, I, I did,#Uninterpretable
I really liked the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,#Statement-non-opinion
that was really intriguing,#Statement-opinion
and it, it didn't scare me all that much, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I don't like to go to movies to be scared,#Statement-non-opinion
that's not why I go#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
no#Agree/Accept
so,#Uninterpretable
I like a good suspenseful#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that one was.#Statement-opinion
story,#Other
and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats,#Statement-opinion
in fact, I want to, uh, rent it when it comes out for my husband to see,#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've seen that.#Statement-non-opinion

Uh, yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I love that movie,#Statement-non-opinion
My husband liked that#Statement-non-opinion

that, that was just, you know, had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I just really enjoyed it,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, um, I'm trying to think,#Hold before answer/agreement
because we saw another one that we thought was really good, early this summer, that was a suspenseful movie.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm trying to remember what it was,#Hold before answer/agreement
because it, you know, it's,#Uninterpretable

All right.#Other
Now, we used to be big time campers#Statement-non-opinion
but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What type of camping did you do?#Wh-Question
Well when we, before we had kids, we was in a motorcycle group,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
w-, we went like twenty or thirty at a time.#Statement-non-opinion
We took, uh, just our little tents,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we did it that way.#Statement-non-opinion
Then when we started having children we bought a camper.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Other
and we did it that way.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how neat.#Appreciation
So, we've always enjoyed camping.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I know I have, um, I just have a tent,#Statement-non-opinion
and the kids and I like to go out and camp in the tent.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then I bought a van#Statement-non-opinion
and that way I can sleep in the van and be more comfortable#Statement-non-opinion
Ye-, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now we have friends with a van,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like one night#Statement-non-opinion
and the next night they'll stay at the motel, you know, or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't, I don't think I'm a real true, trooper, you know, when it comes,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to camping.#Other
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh,#Statement-non-opinion
All the bugs and stuff#Statement-non-opinion
me either.#Other
But I, I try#Statement-non-opinion
I hate to be on all that stuff#Statement-non-opinion
But, but I try,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Appreciation
you know, to, uh, to get out there and enjoy everything.#Other
But what was so fun though is that I had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends#Statement-non-opinion
and he got poison ivy,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's all over him.#Statement-non-opinion
The poor thing, you know,#Other
so, there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes.#Agree/Accept
Oh, shoot.#Appreciation
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But now, I enjoy it every once in a while,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it's not something I'd want to do real often.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm a sissy.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I either want to do it in the fall or spring.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Right.#Agree/Accept
You know?#Rhetorical-Questions
Definitely when it's cool.#Summarize/reformulate
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Well, have you done much camping around Texas?#Yes-No-Question
Well, not really because usually it's when we go off,#Negative non-no answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, like for a couple weeks or so.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's usually like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, have you camped all over the United States?#Yes-No-Question
Just about.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Wow.#Appreciation
Just about.#Affirmative non-yes answers
See now I haven't so that,#Statement-non-opinion
I bet you that's an experience there.#Statement-opinion
Oh, it really is.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It really is.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Also I said we mostly did ours before we started a family.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's a lot easier then.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I know my parents like to camp a lot,#Statement-non-opinion
and they, uh, they've been going to Gulf Shores, Alabama.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, which is really, really neat.#Other
They said they've got the white beaches and the sand,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's not real populated so they can, they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, from what I understand from them it's really, really pretty there.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'd like to go anywhere.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I just like to go.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I really do.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, have you done much camping up in Kentucky and, and those parts,#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
in the mountains?#Other
not really,#Negative non-no answers
not that much.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, we've been, well, we've been to Wyoming, you know, and Kentucky and Montana and, you know, places like that.#Statement-non-opinion
But usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But now that we have children and we go every blue moon,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
I'd rather just go to Galveston.#Other
Oh, yeah,#Appreciation
You know#Other
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
rent a beach house or something, *#Summarize/reformulate
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes.#Agree/Accept
yeah, that's, that's my idea of camping. *#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But we're, uh, we're getting more into it#Statement-non-opinion
and we've done, uh, we've done quite a bit#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, uh, the kids like to go out, you know, as often as they can.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, so that's good.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, they're, they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It is.#Statement-non-opinion
My children really enjoys it.#Statement-non-opinion
They really do.#Statement-non-opinion
But by the time we really get a chance to it's July, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's so hot.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And our camper do-, doesn't have an air conditioner.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's one of those pop-ups.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sure you could put one in probably,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but we hadn't did that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
well, that's really neat.#Appreciation
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well,#Uninterpretable
we all enjoy camping.#Statement-non-opinion
And they're, you know, they're in like and scouts and stuff like that, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, they get to go camping in those organizations also.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
At least their Daddy goes with them,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when they do that.#Other
But,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, that's neat.#Appreciation
That really is.#Other
That's really neat.#Appreciation
Well, how old is your boys,#Wh-Question
Well, I,#Statement-non-opinion
your children?#Other
well, I have, um, a son that's, uh, going to be eleven here pretty soon,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then a daughter that's thirteen.#Other
So, they're, they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Appreciation
cooking and, and all that kind of stuff too.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, that's, that's really neat.#Appreciation
It really is.#Statement-non-opinion
Mine's eleven and eight.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, they really enjoy it too.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I agree with you.#Agree/Accept
They like to get out there#Statement-non-opinion
and, but this wasn't so fun this last time for Nathan to, to get out there#Statement-non-opinion
and he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy#Statement-non-opinion
and it got all into his eye#Statement-non-opinion
and it was really swollen#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, so they had to give him shots and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
oh, well, maybe next time he'll stay away from those particular#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
trees,#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or what, bushes, whatever they are#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I have, uh, brother-in-law and a sister, you know, that just really just camp.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, they love to go camping.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They could, they would all the time they wanted, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
wanted to because there's nothing holding them back.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I'm just not that involved in it.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
now I like to go out like several times a year.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But not on a, on the regular basis.#Statement-non-opinion
I have some friends who go out every single weekend,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when, you know, in the season.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and, and I just couldn't do that,#Statement-non-opinion
Me,#Statement-non-opinion
you know.#Other
I haven't really as far as entertainment,#Other
I don't know what you would do every#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I guess, my entertainment's,#Statement-non-opinion
Just getting away.#Collaborative Completion
television, I guess#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
see, I see, they just want to get away.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But every Friday night they'll go home, you know, straight from work#Statement-non-opinion
and they'll pack up#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, and then they'll leave,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm just going, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
by Friday night I just want to crash, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and I want to go home and, you know, do all that,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I don't either#Statement-non-opinion
and then, uh, get out on the road to boot,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But anyway that's their life#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But they probably live in a city also,#Statement-opinion
don't they?#Tag-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah,#Yes answers
that's true.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, see, we're in a real small county area,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, that makes a big difference.#Statement-opinion
Now that's true.#Agree/Accept
That's true.#Agree/Accept
Because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
That's true.#Agree/Accept
That makes a difference.#Statement-opinion
Well, it was nice talking with you.#Conventional-closing
It was nice talking to you too,#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
and we'll probably be talking to you again.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
well, take care.#Conventional-closing
Oka-, okay,#Conventional-closing
bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Well, I know that, uh,#Other
I have only like two or three favorite television shows.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen, is it Brochco, who does like L A LAW#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh,#Repeat-phrase
and, uh, he also did HILLSTREET BLUES.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like those type of shows.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we really enjoy that too.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I don't get a lot, to watch a whole lot of T V.#Statement-non-opinion
We have a couple of young children,#Statement-non-opinion
and so#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we're usually outside,#Other
and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows that if we get them in bed, we usually watch that,#Statement-non-opinion
and L A LAW is one of my favorites.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
me, too.#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Uninterpretable
they, uh, I think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the re runs in the middle of the season#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns, they start showing some of their newer stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
So I thought that was really interesting the way that they did that.#Statement-opinion
Oh, and so you must watch a lot of, uh, Disney or cartoons then?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, we have on SESAME STREET and MISTER ROGERS, that kind of stuff,#Other answers
and I think those programs are really good for children.#Statement-opinion
I know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing, you know, not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they usually, uh, show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world.#Statement-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My so-, older son, he's going to be five,#Statement-non-opinion
and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's true,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
Well, I noticed that, my kids are, uh, older now,#Statement-non-opinion
they're#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, getting close to the teenage years.#Other
But they did,#Statement-non-opinion
we watched all of MISTER ROGERS and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
but even some of your, uh, cartoons can be very violent#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, they talk about death,#Statement-non-opinion
and, we were watching, uh, oh gosh, BUGS BUNNY just last night#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, I think it was on, I have to remember which channel,#Statement-non-opinion
but anyway, uh, we were watching that#Statement-non-opinion
and it was talking about opera,#Statement-non-opinion
and they showed like what they thought an opera would be,#Statement-non-opinion
and one of the things was to kill the rabbit, kill the rabbit#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I thought, Oh, how violent, you know, to kill the rabbit.#Statement-non-opinion
So he ended up killing the rabbit in the end, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
but then of course, the rabbit comes back to life and says, well, see this is how an opera is supposed to be.#Statement-non-opinion
And I thought, gee whiz, if a little kid was watching this, you know, that would be pretty violent even for a small child.#Statement-opinion
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you know, they, especially boys, I mean, they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I don't think that they really realize that death is forever, you know.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And showing them something like that really doesn't#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
teach them that it is.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Well, I don't think cartoons portray that#Statement-opinion
but like,#Uninterpretable
No,#Agree/Accept
and to get them to feel like that that's just pretend, I think#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is the hardest part, you know.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A cat has nine lives#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they don't,#Reject
they just have one like we do#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Oh, so that's really funny#Statement-opinion
but, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we've gotten,#Other
uh-huh,#Uninterpretable
go ahead.#Action-directive
I was just going to say, I know that, at least before our kids were born, we used to always enjoy watching the COSBY SHOW,#Statement-non-opinion
Thursday nights usually had pretty good, with that, and as far as very good comedy.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like to watch DESIGNING WOMEN if the kids#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
are in bed by then.#Other
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true,#Statement-opinion
that's a good show.#Statement-opinion
I used to watch, uh, DALLAS.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't, I don't know where you're at *#Declarative Wh-Question
We're, we're in Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
Dallas,#Other
yeah.#Response Acknowledgement
I used to watch DALLAS, years ago.#Statement-non-opinion
And somewhere in the middle I got, uh, bored,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, so I, in fact, I didn't even watch the finale.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, you know, that's about how disinterested I had become.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Well, I did watch it just to see what it was#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it wasn't really that great.#Statement-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Well, actual-,#Uninterpretable
I think,#Statement-opinion
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
after a while, they just kind of, you know, there's no new stuff they can do,#Other
they've done everything dirty in the book#Statement-opinion
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
so,#Uninterpretable
Yep,#Agree/Accept
I know,#Statement-opinion
I know.#Statement-opinion
Was it actually based on a book?#Yes-No-Question
Well, no,#No answers
I imagine,#Uninterpretable
Oh, but you were just talking about,#Statement-non-opinion
okay,#Other
okay,#Other
Everything you could think of, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
had a hard time,#Other
and I think maybe with DALLAS, as far as, they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first.#Statement-opinion
That's true,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
Where,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
I never watched KNOTS LANDING,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think they've had a lot of their characters stay around.#Statement-opinion
Stay.#Repeat-phrase
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and if you notice on DALLAS, they lost all the women.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So the men mainly stayed#Statement-non-opinion
but the women were the ones who left,#Statement-non-opinion
and I thought that was very interesting and wondered, kind of wondered about that.#Statement-opinion
Uh, well, anyway that's a whole new issue#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, goodness#Appreciation
so. Anyway. I don't know if our five minutes are over yet#Statement-non-opinion
But we, uh, we also have the paid, uh, television channels.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, the only thing I don't like about it, especially with teenagers, is that all the violence, the sex, the nudity and the curse words#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
And so, I know they didn't pick up these curse words from me.#Statement-non-opinion
So, uh, they had to have picked them up from, uh, the T V.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
One nice thing though about the cable company we use, they have, uh, they have that little parental, uh, uh, key,#Statement-opinion
Where you can lock up,#Signal-non-understanding
Yeah.#Yes answers
the channel or whatever?#Other
Yeah,#Yes answers
uh-huh.#Yes answers
So, I, I have that at home,#Statement-non-opinion
and I keep the keys with me.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's about the only way that I can, that I can do it.#Statement-opinion
Because their natural curiosity, you know, to go towards that way and want#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Repeat-phrase
And I don't know the way the generations are growing up now,#Statement-opinion
I mean I just think they watch so much more T V.#Statement-opinion
I try to limit what they watch.#Statement-non-opinion
They aren't sitting in the house watching T V all day#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I think it's good for them to have physical activity and that kind of stuff, too.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings.#Statement-non-opinion
It's the only cool time to be outside#Statement-non-opinion
That's true,#Agree/Accept
well, and here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high.#Statement-opinion
Well, true,#Agree/Accept
Well, it was nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Well, it was nice talking to you, too.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
talk with you later.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Good-bye.#Conventional-closing
Good-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay#Other
Uh, I just currently quit my job#Statement-non-opinion
and so I really don't receive any benefits right now#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But my husband does#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I think one of the, uh, my,#Statement-non-opinion
first of all, always salary and se-,#Statement-non-opinion
the second thing is, uh, because we have children,#Statement-non-opinion
so it would be, uh, health benefits and medical benefits#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Definitely.#Agree/Accept
and, uh, right now we have probably some excellent benefits right now.#Other
We have with Aetna#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I don't know if you're familiar with them#Statement-non-opinion
but we're real happy with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've had a variety of different jobs with a various types, uh, in the computer field.#Statement-non-opinion
And so I've seen a variety of types of benefits.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I've worked for, for for awhile#Statement-non-opinion
and they are, you know, a really academic type of place.#Statement-non-opinion
And then I've worked with regular, you know, industry type places. And then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
So I've seen a wide range of both, you know, nonsalary type benefits and other stuff, you know, like health care that's either fully or partially paid#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, some have like bonuses#Statement-non-opinion
and others have had lots of vacation time but not much other types of benefits#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, yeah, I would#Other
I'd say health care is way up there, especially anybody with kids.#Statement-opinion
Uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's one of the big things that we always look at, you know. When we, when I think about t-, changing jobs is, you know, you know, what kind of health care they have#Other
and does the company pay for it. You know, all or partially#Statement-non-opinion
or how does that work.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, also, uh, vacation time too is a, is a big one for me.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and I guess support for whatever, whatever other,#Other
.#Non-verbal
you know, kinds of professional activities you have at, you know, work.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, cause I've#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any and#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
some that, sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though,#Other
so that's not so bad, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, it's kind of a give and take kind of thing, I think.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I say that health care is probably definitely number one though.#Statement-opinion
want to just, you know, all your salary can't even begin#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to pay for what you can wind up losing, you know#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in a major illness or something. Uh.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
Uh, and, and, and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices on who to go with.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that really helped us out a great deal.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
But my husband does get vacation#Statement-non-opinion
and it's worked out really good for us too.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So#Uninterpretable
But.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Flexible hours are, are pretty important to me as well.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, cause that makes a big difference.#Statement-opinion
My wife works part-time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And she works, uh, as a assistant manager in a fabric store.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so she works a lot of evenings and weekends#Statement-non-opinion
and so two days a week, I, uh, manage to get home early enough to meet the kids on the bus#Statement-non-opinion
So she wor-, you know, goes in early those days and works like, you know, noon til close.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, so we have#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's great that you all can work that out.#Appreciation
That's really good.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and being on a, you know, rigid schedule wouldn't, there wouldn't be anyway to do that at all.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean usually, you know, you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting, up for school#Statement-non-opinion
and you get home#Statement-non-opinion
and it's already dark unless it's summer time, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
And even in summer time, sometimes you get home so late that there's, you know, you can't do anything with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And especially in the winter. I mean, you g-, get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know.#Statement-non-opinion
It's like, it's like a vampire sometimes#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
It's the same with my husband cause he's got pretty flexible hours if, as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do .#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Worked out really well for us too.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh. Well is there anything else that you look for#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Uh, a lot of I guess is.#Statement-non-opinion
You've hit pretty,#Statement-opinion
you've put a lot of the main points in.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I think some of, is how the, uh, you know,#Statement-opinion
I guess it's not really a direct benefit but how your, uh, performance is rated and stuff like that at work.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Cause I've been, uh,#Uninterpretable
especially in large corporations. You can really, you know, wind up getting, having, you know, real problems I've found out.#Statement-non-opinion
I've worked for a few, you know, several thousand plus, you know, type companies.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it, and especially if you're doing like professional work. Where i-, you know, it's kind of ethereal as to what you're doing#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
If you're,#Uninterpretable
like I've,#Uninterpretable
I work with, uh, computer systems a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
So it's kind of hard to say, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
If you're, you know, a brick layer, somebody can look and see, you know, well, yeah, you laid, you know, fifteen thousand bricks today#Statement-non-opinion
and they were all straight#Quotation
and your building didn't fall down, you know#Quotation
Yeah,#Quotation
you did a great job.#Quotation
But if you build computer systems, like, well, you know, what does that computer program really do, you know. Or, especially if you write like papers, you know.#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or do design studies or something.#Other
It's real hard to rate something like that.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's like get a painter, you know, or something, a artist.#Statement-non-opinion
It's like well you, how do you really rate, you know, Michelangelo, you know#Rhetorical-Questions
How would you tell if he was, you know, really good or so-so or whatever#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
And that does make a wan-, a person want to stay#Statement-opinion

Uh, so, uh, what are your benefits like at your job,#Wh-Question
and how do you feel about them?#Open-Question
Uh, pretty good, actually.#Statement-non-opinion
I work for Hewlett Packard#Statement-non-opinion
and they have, uh, a pretty good, uh, benefits package.#Statement-opinion
In fact, they're, they're kind of known, uh, for having good benefits.#Statement-non-opinion
The pay isn't fabulous,#Statement-opinion
although I saw a survey recently#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm actually making just about as much as, you know, I'm m-, making actually over average, over the average#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's good.#Appreciation
for my career, my experience and all that stuff#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which kind of surprised me.#Other
What kind of a degree have you got?#Wh-Question
I've got a Bachelor's in electrical engineering#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I'm not, like, a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, anyway, the, our benefits are pretty good.#Statement-opinion
We've got stock purchase program and a,#Statement-non-opinion
that, that's pretty generous, although you have to hold the stock for two years#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
before you get the company contribution which is, kind of a, a pain,#Other
but, uh, there's a four O one K plan#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, for, uh, sheltering some taxable income.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, there's,#Uninterpretable
How long have you been with them?#Wh-Question
I've been with them for seven years.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's good.#Appreciation
And, the best thing, and a lot of the stuff, the best thing is like four years or five years, it's pretty soon, you're#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
completely vested in the retirement plan and everything,#Other
so, uh, it's not t-,#Uninterpretable
but there's full, uh, th-, there's several medical plans to choose from, uh, that cover pretty much everything.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't get sick that often,#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't pay much of it,#Statement-non-opinion
b-, and I pay five dollars every time I visit the, the hospital#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, you know, for a checkup or whatever.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, they don't cover eyes though,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I have contact lenses,#Statement-non-opinion
so that's kind of a pain.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, you know, I#Statement-non-opinion
But, for all#Summarize/reformulate
I can live,#Other
practical purpose, you are almost a hundred percent covered.#Other
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
So that you've got small, small things to gripe about.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Wow.#Appreciation
And,#Uninterpretable
Well, that sounds like you must feel really good about it.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah,#Yes answers
and, and the dental plan is fabulous.#Statement-opinion
The dental plan, I pay absolutely nothing because, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
I, I guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's not the case,#Other
so, I guess nothing.#Statement-non-opinion
It's fabulous.#Statement-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
Uh, the,#Uninterpretable
what about you?#Open-Question
Well, I, uh, work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory.#Statement-non-opinion
I also have a part time job at a law firm#Statement-non-opinion
and I get no benefits from them, at to the part time work although, they pay better per hour#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than my, my sort of, quote, real job does.#Other
.#Non-verbal
Uh, and benefits, through the government are, uh, really,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, they just, uh, they're not the greatest.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I, before I, I, uh, uh, got my degree#Statement-non-opinion
Uh ,#Uninterpretable
I'm, uh, c-, a computer scientist#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and before I got my degree, I had, uh, done paralegal work#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for law firms here in Washington#Other
and, uh, at that time, I was in gravy city.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, the law firms in this town are not, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
early eighties#Other
and, uh, benefits were just amazing#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we had everything paid for,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, anyway, with the government, it's not, uh, quite that nice a deal.#Statement-opinion
Uh, but it's, you know, it's, it's okay.#Statement-opinion
What we have to do is, we have to pay, uh, about twenty percent of our, uh, uh, our costs#Statement-non-opinion
and it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing,#Statement-non-opinion
and the plans that are available to us, uh, range from kind of mediocre to really sweet#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, so I, I think I'm actually involved in a relatively good p-, plan at this point.#Statement-opinion
Uh, but, uh, it could be better,#Statement-opinion
that's for sure,#Statement-opinion
and, uh, but, you know#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the-, there are other things that you get when you work for the government i-, uh, in, in terms of, uh, more relaxed atmosphere.#Other
It's really nice to be, for me, anyway, to be able to work in, uh, a research atmosphere, uh, where I don't have to, uh, uh, you know, worry about, uh, academics or anything like that,#Statement-non-opinion
and, so I'm, I'm really kind of happy about that end of, of things.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
one of the things with my company is that they've, uh, got a reputation for a lot of job security#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's a lot of different things that they do, lot of different divisions even this area, in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do,#Other
so there's,#Uninterpretable
I, myself have moved around quite a bit within the company#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's, and I, and I haven't had to move my residence to do that.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I still live in San Jose#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Wow,#Appreciation
that's fabulous.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it,#Uninterpretable
You see, now that's, that's interesting,#Statement-opinion
because I have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah?#Backchannel in question form
up in the Massachusetts area.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He, he lives in Andover#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, the work that he,#Statement-non-opinion
he's, uh, specifically an engineer and, and does work with, uh, the Hewlett Packard machines that do, uh, uh, sonographic imagining#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I've been over to see his complex over there#Statement-non-opinion
and it's amazing.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, it's all ecologically designed#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, uh, he seems really, really happy with the, the set up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
In fact, I know a guy who works at Andover who used to work, who I used to work with out here#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he moved his family back east a few years ago to, to take that position.#Statement-non-opinion
Kind of interesting.#Statement-opinion
Uh, a-, anyhow,#Uninterpretable

What are your favorite programs?#Wh-Question
Uh, it's kind of hard to put my finger on a, on a favorite T V program,#Statement-non-opinion
however, uh, one that I've been watching for a number of years is DALLAS.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how funny.#Appreciation
And, uh, it's going to be going off the air, uh, let's see, a week from Fri-, a week from tonight.#Other
It's going to be its last show.#Statement-non-opinion
So I've, I've kind of enjoyed watching over the years.#Statement-non-opinion
I've been disappointed in it and also pleased in it.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, I was, uh, greatly disappointed, uh, when I did move down to Plano to, uh, find out that the, uh, the, uh, great South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
I've seen the sign that goes to there.#Statement-non-opinion
I've,#Uninterpretable
well I think I've seen it in the distance.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I have not even seen it.#Statement-non-opinion
And I have not seen the program.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh well,#Other
So#Uninterpretable
That's a shame.#Other
And, and, uh, I know when we went to London, it was really funny.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, people recognized Dallas, Texas, by the, the Texas, uh, the, the cowboys#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and by that program.#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's, that's the two things they associate with Dallas, Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
I,#Uninterpretable
and I,#Uninterpretable
they asked me, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
several times, several times they ask me, why are there two bridges?#Statement-non-opinion
And I didn't know what they were talking about.#Statement-non-opinion
It took me a long time, they're talking about the viaducts.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Is that,#Yes-No-Question
that is right, isn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Because they ask me, why are there two bridges going into Dallas?#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Darned if I know#Statement-non-opinion
I was blank looking, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
I felt really dumb.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, it's, it's, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
when you look at the, uh, you know, route seventy-five, coming down there. I mean, it's actually a bridge,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's a bridge over top of roadway.#Statement-non-opinion
There's no water there. I mean, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, there's water in the Trinity.#Statement-non-opinion
I thought it was to, going to Oak Cliff over the Trinity.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well there's, there, uh,#Uninterpretable
well they,#Uninterpretable
I think when they open the show up they give you two different views of Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, do they?#Backchannel in question form
One from the east and one from the west.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's why.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Response Acknowledgement
But it kind of confuses people.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, uh, I enjoy, uh, uh, a lot of different comedies.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I think it's mainly for an escape, um, you know, you, uh, my job is not the most thrilling in the world#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I enjoy laughing and, uh, some of the shows that, uh, are on the air, some are just purely, you know, brain drainers.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then there's other ones that, uh, deal with, uh, in a funny manner, uh, socially relevant things.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, one show that comes to mind is like DESIGNING WOMEN. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I think that is just a hoot.#Statement-opinion
That's one of those few that I do watch when the television is on.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband likes to watch T V.#Statement-non-opinion
It's on.#Statement-non-opinion
I usually read and watch T V.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And usually I can handle both at the same time, you know. *#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I am pretty sure where the T V plot's going. *#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But that's one of the few that I just actually watch.#Statement-non-opinion
Because#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
it's funny.#Other
I really enjoy that one.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
It, uh, it has been very entertaining#Statement-opinion
and, and also, uh, the, the issues they deal with, uh, really tends to open, open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, I've, I've really enjoyed that one since it came on.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I don't like the politics surrounding the program though,#Statement-non-opinion
but, I mean, other than that, you know, there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
and then, uh, I've kind of gotten hooked on P B S stuff, uh, public, uh, T V.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I like things like NOVA and, uh, some of the, the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
I just enjoy watching that stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Now, we watch a lot of those.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and the ones that sometimes will hook me, to put down my book, will be the one, there was one, uh, recently about the Gettysburg Address.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they wrapped a fictional story around it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I thought that was well done.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and it, it caught my attention.#Statement-non-opinion
I wound up watching the whole thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I guess the awards ceremonies, and there seems to be dozens of them per year.#Statement-non-opinion
Maybe I've spent two minutes watching to see what they on and if they make a fool of themselves or not#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But they could take that whole collection#Statement-non-opinion
and it would disappear#Statement-non-opinion
and I'd never miss it for a minute. *#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Especially the beauty pageants. *#Other
I, I, particularly take issue with those.#Statement-opinion
I, I really dislike those.#Statement-opinion
Well I'm one of those rare guys, who, I, I rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event, um, if ever watch one.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, there's just not that much I'm, I'm interested in.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, for a while, I, I, I watched some football,#Statement-non-opinion
but I've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and, and watch a baseball game.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, my husband used to just be riveted to the Dallas Cowboys.#Statement-non-opinion
And now, we're out running around,#Statement-non-opinion
and if they're, if they're playing, he'll turn it on while we're in the car to see what the score is,#Statement-non-opinion
and he'll listen.#Statement-non-opinion
But, even I've said, hey look, you're fascinated with this, you sit and listen to the Cowboys.#Statement-non-opinion
Let me run in here,#Quotation
and I'll do some things#Quotation
and I'll come back#Quotation
and you don't have to miss, he'll say, na, na, na.#Statement-non-opinion
And he doesn't, he doesn't watch it.#Statement-non-opinion
He list-, like I say,#Statement-non-opinion
if it's convenient he'll listen to it.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But he just doesn't watch them on T V like he used to.#Statement-non-opinion
Well I think it was great when they were, you know, like world champs and they were doing real well.#Statement-opinion
I, uh, I#Uninterpretable
personally, I, I came from the Washington area.#Statement-non-opinion
And so#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was a big Washington Redskins fan.#Other
Oh, those people.#Appreciation
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
And, uh, when I came down to Dallas, it was, uh, you know, I found myself rooting for the home team.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh,#Uninterpretable
in fact I have a, uh, a baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how neat.#Appreciation
the only year they played together on the Dallas Cowboys.#Other
Well, I actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
And, I, I, I make the trip and did the whole New Orleans before the game and the game and everything#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh. *#Other
uh, that was, that was a lot of fun.#Other
Yeah. *#Other
But, I don't know, I haven't been as,#Statement-non-opinion
I'll tell you what I love to watch. And this is not, this is rarely on television.#Statement-non-opinion
But what is a lot of fun to go attend, is this arena football.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like it so much better than straight football.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I haven't seen that.#Statement-non-opinion
It, it doesn't,#Uninterpretable
it has a lot of different rules.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The field is half the size#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and there's no,#Statement-non-opinion
they can't call time and things like that.#Other
It moves a lot faster.#Statement-non-opinion
uh. Gee, I'll have to try to catch that sometime.#Statement-non-opinion
It's,#Uninterpretable
Uh, again I think it may be on cable more than anything else.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We#Statement-non-opinion
that's probably true.#Maybe/Accept-part
don't have cable.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
we don't either.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh, I couldn't rationalize paying, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it's like if I pay for a movie channel, then I have watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them.#Statement-non-opinion
And if I, you know, if I didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic, well I can get that for free.#Statement-non-opinion
And well, I really don't need C N N, I see enough bad news all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't need to see more of it.#Statement-non-opinion
So I, I've kind of, uh, rationalized that it's, it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see.#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
And of course when we were living in Texas, it was real convenient with Tom Thumb.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, having movies, uh, back then it was ninety-nine cents.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, go,#Uninterpretable
They're everywhere, they're#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
on every corner.#Other
Everything you've ever wanted to see.#Statement-non-opinion
Um. You can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like H B O or Cinemax.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, and I like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or it becomes snack time for various reasons.#Statement-non-opinion
You can put, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
the only thing, this DANCE WITH WOLVES, I want to see it in a theater.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
I do too.#Agree/Accept
Because I understand that, that your, you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
And I, uh, I've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it.#Statement-non-opinion
She, she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, you know, she just doesn't like them.#Statement-non-opinion
And, um, she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie.#Statement-non-opinion
And I've told her, you know, everybody I know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick.#Statement-non-opinion
That's what I hear too.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, so I'm, I'm hoping I can get her talked into it soon.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, my husband smokes.#Statement-non-opinion
He's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you can't smoke in movie theaters.#Statement-non-opinion
And that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies.#Statement-non-opinion
But I haven't really cared up until this point.#Statement-non-opinion
But I,#Uninterpretable
we are this weekend going to go see DANCE WITH WOLVES.#Statement-non-opinion
It's,#Uninterpretable
that's it.#Statement-non-opinion
We will do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
That's great.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
finally.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But as, as far as, uh, regular T V shows, I mean, I've got some, some shows that, that, that I would be afraid to admit to you that I've actually sat down and watched#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And then there's, there's others that, uh, uh, I wish I had time to see.#Statement-non-opinion
It's like I enjoy watching CHEERS.#Statement-non-opinion
It's very funny.#Statement-opinion
Some of the things in it are mindless,#Statement-opinion
but I, I just don't have time to watch it.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I think about the only night that I really sit in front of the T V set all night long probably is on Monday night.#Statement-non-opinion
Because, um, I work so hard over the weekend, doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday.#Statement-non-opinion
Monday night I'm just worn out.#Statement-non-opinion
So I kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and, and look over things.#Statement-non-opinion
And I can sit in front of the T V set and look at, you know, do, go through my mail and, and watch T V at the same time.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I tend,#Statement-non-opinion
my job tends to be very demanding.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And to sit down and to mindlessly either read or just mindlessly stare in absolute comfort isn't as bad as it used to,#Statement-non-opinion

Um,#Uninterpretable
So you have a son?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
I have an older son,#Affirmative non-yes answers
yeah.#Yes answers
He doesn't have any children yet though.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, he's thirty-seven#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't know if he's ever going to have any or not,#Statement-non-opinion
but I do have some neighbor kids, lots of little neighbor kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That,#Uninterpretable
I go out and, uh, I play ball with them.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, it's, because like this one that lives right next door, her mother does some work at home#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on computers#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her. Which is kind of sad, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them.#Statement-non-opinion
So I will go out and play catch with them or you know, we ha-, let the dogs outside#Statement-non-opinion
and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, actually I do think that the parents should have, you know, a little bit more time to spend with their kids.#Statement-opinion
I would think so.#Agree/Accept
When you,#Uninterpretable
when, when your son was at home did you, uh, working?#Yes-No-Question
Did you work#Yes-No-Question
or were you able to stay at home with him?#Or-Clause
No,#No answers
when my son was at home, I, I did work#Statement-non-opinion
and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but we always had our days off together#Statement-non-opinion
and we went camping on vacations.#Statement-non-opinion
So we had a lot of time together that way you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well when my mom, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
when I was growing up my mom worked too,#Statement-non-opinion
but she worked nights#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, as a nurse#Other
and so she was always home for us#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I always, I really appreciated that. Having her there when I was, you know, when I came home from school and when I worked,#Statement-non-opinion
but now when I look back at it, it must have been a really difficult thing that she did#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for us.#Other
Oh yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well I am sure it was, you know.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, I don't know what the families are going to come to now days because they, there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids.#Statement-opinion
Because most, most of them, the father and mother both work, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, it's really rough.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I have one neighbor that's, uh, the father is a fireman#Statement-non-opinion
and he works like four days on#Statement-non-opinion
and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days,#Statement-non-opinion
but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
So, he's got a second job.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So he's, you know he's not home very often.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's, you know,#Uninterpretable
the kids I know miss that.#Statement-non-opinion
They really do.#Agree/Accept
You know.#Other
Uh, a family without a father, it's, it's, uh a really hard thing.#Statement-opinion
Yeah, you know#Agree/Accept
and I don't know,#Hedge
I, I suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because, you know, he is out working trying to make some money for, you know, we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Kids, I think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I am sure they would you know.#Agree/Accept
So, are you planning on, to having any children#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Oh yeah.#Yes answers
Oh yeah.#Yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But we are,#Uninterpretable
we just got married like, like December,#Statement-non-opinion
so we are going to wait a year.#Statement-non-opinion
Um. Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Statement-non-opinion
Well that's good.#Appreciation
Then we will try.#Other
That's what my uh, daughter-in-law told me. That they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they will be married nine years#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
this year.#Other
So, I don't know.#Hedge
She's a nurse, you know#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids,#Statement-non-opinion
so maybe they just decided that, uh, if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's a possibility.#Statement-opinion
You know.#Other
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, We really want to have a family.#Statement-non-opinion
We feel like that, that couple you know, you are not giving enough of yourself#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you should, you should be sharing your family.#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so,#Uninterpretable
And giving your values, you know, making something better of the world by raising up good kids#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and letting them know they're loved and stuff.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Give them, give them an edge,#Statement-opinion
but, we feel like, like the first year needs to be devoted to, uh, making the family, the couple strong#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and secure in their love for each other.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But then, a family is, is definitely a high priority.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, do you plan on staying home after you have your children#Yes-No-Question
or do you, do you work or what?#Or-Clause
Well, well I, uh, I am in, I am in a different situation.#Statement-non-opinion
I am a missionary#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I am home on furlough.#Statement-non-opinion
It called, like#Statement-non-opinion
I have worked for four years in Africa#Statement-non-opinion
and I come home for a year.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then we go back for four years.#Statement-non-opinion
But my husband and I will do the same job#Statement-non-opinion
and we will be living in, in Africa#Statement-non-opinion
and we will be working together.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, we will, we will share the job of raising the family.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean as a mother I will have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have#Statement-non-opinion
but, still we will share that job.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But we have,#Uninterpretable
then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling, like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, that kind of thing#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or do you send them away to boarding school#Quotation
and if you do that when do you do it#Quotation
and that's a,#Uninterpretable

Okay.#Other
Well, Carolyn, the, uh, one of the main things I'd like, like to know is, uh, how do you feel about the, knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth.#Open-Question
Well.#Uninterpretable
What do you think would be required, and so forth?#Open-Question
Uh, I'll tell you,#Hold before answer/agreement
I, I watched what went on, um, with the TWENTY TWENTY show, I don't know if you saw that a few days ago that, that talked about nursing homes,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
and actually they specifically talked about some in the area where I am, here in Texas,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Oh, you knew of the homes, then.#Yes-No-Question
Pardon?#Signal-non-understanding
You knew of the homes themselves?#Yes-No-Question
Well, I,#Uninterpretable
no,#No answers
I'm not familiar with those homes per se#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
but, um, they were in the area where I live#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
uh,#Other
and it was really revealing to see some of the, you know, the things that go on, I guess, in some of these homes,#Statement-non-opinion
so I would definitely, you know, want to really check things out and, uh, go,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that, to, to make sure that you went daily, you know#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and made sure that they were cared for,#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Well, from your point of view, how would you feel about actually sending someone that, that's, you know, means something to you to one of those homes.#Wh-Question
I realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it#Summarize/reformulate
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
and, of course, that makes sense,#Appreciation
but how do you think they would feel, I should say, about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new, new home situation?#Open-Question
Well, actually, I have that kind of situation, because my mother lives with me,#Dispreferred answers
and she's#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
eighty-seven#Other
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
and, uh, from the time that we were tiny, she said, you know, I want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I know how she feels about it.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, if I, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if I ever had to put her there, I think, uh, it would be probably when I just could not handle it any more, you know, if I#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she got to the point where she was totally bedridden, and, and I mean, I just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed,#Other
I think that would be the,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, how do you find that your, your personal relationship is with her, know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal?#Open-Question
Does that, does that cause any problems between the two of you?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, I wouldn't say any more than usual.#Negative non-no answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Is she,#Uninterpretable
I think it's very hard for her, um, to be waited upon, so to speak,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I think it's hard for her to have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to.#Statement-non-opinion
It's hard to accept the fact that you're unable to pursue life, at the level that you did before,#Yes-No-Question
isn't it?#Tag-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I think that's very true.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, on the other hand, it takes on almost a, a switch of a mother child relationship.#Statement-opinion
It is different.#Statement-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I had that almost similar situation.#Statement-non-opinion
My mother lives in an apartment with my sister#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, so I, except for the three or four months this summer,#Statement-non-opinion
that's the only time I ever spent with my mother,#Statement-non-opinion
and, of course, since I see her only once or twice a year, I was just thrilled#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to have her here with me,#Other
and I spent every minute I could to be with her and, uh, cooking foods for her, you know, just to make her, her life as though she were on vacation.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But somehow another, it, that doesn't work between my mom and my sister,#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they find they, they are,#Statement-non-opinion
in speaking they,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
my mother feels uncomfortable around my sister,#Statement-non-opinion
and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I guess it's just because they're there all the time.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's, it puts, has put pressure on both of them from that point of view.#Statement-non-opinion
So that's, that's kind of bad news.#Appreciation
And by the same token, my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home,#Statement-non-opinion
and after all she has been a farmer's wife for sixty years#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm, into another home where the environment is totally different.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
She's relatively happy,#Statement-non-opinion
but she doesn't like the food.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And when she complains about the food#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then they kind of get angry with her.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, that's another one of those things you have to solve.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Well, that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's, as you say, lived on a farm for sixty years,#Statement-opinion
and then go to something like that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
after all, their, their life is so totally different#Statement-opinion
because in those early days, the food, they had to make it from scratch, so to speak.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you raised your own chickens,#Statement-non-opinion
and you killed your own hogs, I suppose,#Statement-non-opinion
and then they#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they had to store the meat in, uh,#Other
I don't want to say barns,#Statement-non-opinion
but they had regular little places they, they would hang it, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to cure it and so forth.#Other
And, and now, all of a sudden, it, uh, comes in differently,#Statement-non-opinion
it tastes differently.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Well, tell me about your home.#Action-directive
Okay.#Agree/Accept
Uh, right now we're living in,#Statement-non-opinion
well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, right now we're in a, uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which you might call it.#Other
So we don't have a, a big yard. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us.#Statement-non-opinion
So it was enough.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half.#Statement-non-opinion
Because it's not a full two story.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom.#Other
So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house#Statement-non-opinion
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, it's about a five year old house now.#Statement-non-opinion
It sounds nice.#Appreciation
It's, uh, pretty nice.#Agree/Accept
Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
It was a,#Uninterpretable
Landmark is the one who built it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you know, these guys that gambled high#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
lost big you know.#Other
That's true.#Agree/Accept
And, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly what happened to them.#Agree/Accept
I'm insulating myself from that problem.#Other
I'm building my own house.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's nice.#Appreciation
And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
Are you doing it yourself?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Wow.#Appreciation
I used to be a builder.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's nice.#Appreciation
And I retired about five years ago and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
started college.#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And now I'm a college educated builder#Statement-non-opinion
There's still no work, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials#Statement-non-opinion
so I did.#Statement-non-opinion
That's great.#Appreciation
And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.#Statement-non-opinion
R-,#Uninterpretable
is that so?#Backchannel in question form
I didn't know that.#Statement-non-opinion
You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house#Statement-non-opinion
but you can't borrow the money to build your own.#Statement-non-opinion
Well that sounds kind of dumb.#Appreciation
Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then it doesn't sell#Statement-non-opinion
and then the bank's#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
holding the bag.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well.#Uninterpretable
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?#Statement-opinion
That's right#Agree/Accept
Hence the savings and loan problem we have.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple.#Statement-non-opinion
It's designed to be added on to.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's good.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I figure it's just me and my wife#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,#Statement-non-opinion
so I want#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to have a shop.#Other
How big a lot do you got it on?#Wh-Question
Ten acres.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
That's nice.#Appreciation
That's real nice.#Appreciation
Well, yeah.#Agree/Accept
It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor.#Statement-non-opinion
He's on the other side of a hill.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Seriously.#Statement-non-opinion

That's pretty good.#Appreciation
Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
Oh, that's pretty good.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.#Other
Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?#Yes-No-Question
Well, it's got a, a very small furnace.#Dispreferred answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, lo-, these many months#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I have not had to use the heat.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
Because it's all geothermal.#Statement-non-opinion

Wow.#Appreciation
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
My wife would love that#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
She loves lots of windows.#Statement-non-opinion
There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.#Other
That's great.#Appreciation
So, uh,#Uninterpretable
Is it a single story?#Yes-No-Question
Well, not really.#Dispreferred answers
It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Response Acknowledgement
So the first, you know,#Uninterpretable
the, the, the,#Uninterpretable
what I call residential level#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.#Other
Um, I see.#Response Acknowledgement
And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
So I've got a pretty good grade there.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then when I put the verandas whi-, which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that will define the shop.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?#Yes-No-Question
Exactly.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I've always liked that.#Statement-non-opinion
The,#Uninterpretable
you know, I, we don't have much yard#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck.#Statement-non-opinion

Cooking and food, huh.#Yes-No-Question
Food#Dispreferred answers
What do you like to cook?#Open-Question
Uh, I don't cook a lot actually.#Statement-non-opinion
I have just started baking,#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh, I am kind of interested in cakes and, uh, muffins and stuff like that,#Statement-non-opinion
but I can't seem to get them exactly right.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I am just trying to perfect some things.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I tried to make an applesauce cake. Which I will never ever try to make again.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
It was horrible#Statement-non-opinion
Oh dear.#Appreciation
I don't know if the cake was horrible or if I made it horrible.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, probably not.#Reject
I, uh, have, uh, a bread recipe that is real easy that everyone always really does like.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That, uh, doesn't require kneading the dough.#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Hey#Appreciation
And, it is always, it is wonderful.#Statement-non-opinion
It is,#Statement-non-opinion
and what is funny is that you use, uh, bran, all bran#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it looks like it is a wheat bread.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, it is actually all bran flour#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, you know, it is just regular#Statement-non-opinion
the type that, you know, yeast and that sort of thing#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you let it rise#Statement-non-opinion
and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and then punch it down, and then, uh, make your rolls.#Statement-non-opinion
They really are good#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
and they are so easy to do.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That is#Uninterpretable
seems like every time that we have a dinner party, or that we are going some place where everybody is suppose to bring something and they have had my rolls before.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They request it.#Collaborative Completion
They always ask me to, bring those rolls#Other
I have not gotten any requests yet.#Statement-non-opinion
Last year, I had a Christmas party, at, uh, my office,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, uh, made the tuna fish sandwiches.#Statement-non-opinion
And everyone, uh, I mean, I think, everyone knows how to make tuna fish,#Statement-non-opinion
so I thought that would be easy for me to make#Statement-non-opinion
and I can not go wrong with that,#Statement-non-opinion
and so I made it#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I used celery seed in my,#Statement-non-opinion
Do you use celery seed in your tuna fish?#Yes-No-Question
No#No answers
I haven't.#Statement-non-opinion

because I never, I thought that that was what celery seed was for.#Statement-non-opinion
Was for tuna fish.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how funny.#Appreciation
And so, but everyone really, really loved the tuna fish#Statement-non-opinion
and they just couldn't get over the fact that I used celery in it#Statement-non-opinion
and it just surprised me.#Statement-non-opinion
Celery and onion and,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, see I, I have always used celery, I mean, I have used celery before.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I never used the celery seed in it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, what else do you put in it besides the celery seed.#Wh-Question
Just like, uh, really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed#Statement-non-opinion
and I use like, uh, Miracle Whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I really don't like the Helman's Mayonnaise.#Other
But if you use salad dressing with kind of, uh, you know, kind of, I guess a tart taste.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Then it comes out real good.#Other
But, I, uh, it was the first time I have I have ever found out that the, the, nobody else used celery seed.#Statement-non-opinion
I feel so silly#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
See, I have never put bell pepper in tuna fish either.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Isn't that funny?#Backchannel in question form
.#Non-verbal
I was brought up with tuna fish, you know, where you put in, uh, oh, chopped hard boiled eggs which is#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now is a no, no with cholesterol and, uh,#Other
.#Non-verbal
you know, chopped up dill pickles.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that sort of thing.#Other
The standard old tuna fish.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I would put that too.#Statement-non-opinion
I just did not have those things.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like I don't think I had eggs that night or something,#Statement-non-opinion
but I would have put eggs.#Statement-non-opinion
I would have put eggs in there also.#Statement-non-opinion
But isn't that interesting?#Backchannel in question form
So you,#Summarize/reformulate
Uh, strange.#Appreciation
You, you use bell pepper and onion and#Other
Celery seed.#Collaborative Completion
celery seed.#Other
I will have to try that.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you use a regular mayonnaise or,#Or-Clause
Sometimes I do#Statement-non-opinion
and sometimes I use the Miracle Whip.#Statement-non-opinion
The Miracle Whip.#Other
It depends on what I have.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And sometimes, if I am using, like, regular mayonnaise, to spice it up a little bit#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I will use a little bit of mustard with it.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do that also.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just to, to put a little zing in it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
But not a bunch.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But enough to, make it have a little bit more flavor.#Statement-opinion
I love barbecue.#Statement-non-opinion
Anything barbecued I will eat.#Statement-non-opinion
I like, uh, to barbecue baby back ribs.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, and, and, they are so easy to do if you, uh, have a good barbecue sauce#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you, uh, just cook them very, very slowly in the oven.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it is not hard to cook, like some meals are.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it is not, of course, it is messy to eat.#Statement-opinion
That is the disadvantage.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I make lasagna from scratch#Statement-non-opinion
and people really like my lasagna#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like to make that too.#Statement-non-opinion
I make that once in a while.#Statement-non-opinion
and so, uh, sometimes, I am requested to make that.#Statement-non-opinion
And that is not too hard to do because you can do it in advanced and just bake it.#Statement-opinion
It is not really, once you have all the ingredients#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it is just the layering really.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And not breaking the, uh, the, uh, pasta.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That is the hardest part probably.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Then, I have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie.#Statement-non-opinion
It just takes forever#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, it is, uh, when the strawberries are nice, and big and fresh and yummy.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you make cheesecake?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, uh-huh.#Yes answers
I do.#Statement-non-opinion
But this one is basically, it is like a normal pie crust.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But then you use this sort of, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it is a cream cheese, uh, uh, layering,#Statement-non-opinion
but you, use, uh, thin it out a little bit.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, or make it a little fluffier#Other
and you put, uh, line the whole pie crust with that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so, it is sort of like in a way. Uh, using cheese#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
cake,#Other
but, and it is not a real cheese cake#Statement-non-opinion
and then you,#Uninterpretable
And just put the strawberries,#Declarative Yes-No-Question

I'd love to have a dog, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
I've got a little doggy, uh, that I've had quite, uh, quite a long time.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, she just turned sixteen years old New Year's Eve.#Statement-non-opinion

my, I got my mom a teacup little mutt ,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
not too long ago.#Other
This is a little bigger than a teacup.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, it's funny how, uh, how I, I, uh, a-, acquired this animal.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, when I was, uh, married, my, uh, ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy. That she needed,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, the woman needed someone to baby-sit#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, this is what she had told the kids#Statement-non-opinion
and she even told me that.#Statement-non-opinion
And after the two week period was up, uh, she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, after you had an animal for a couple of weeks, it's, uh, you become#Statement-opinion
Oh, for sure.#Agree/Accept
you become attached to it.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I've had this dog now for, for sixteen years#Statement-non-opinion
and she's been a lot of company#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, she's, uh, however, getting a little old#Statement-non-opinion
and things are starting to fail.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I, I live alone now#Statement-non-opinion
and she stays in the house all day while I go to work#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, she's been holding herself pretty well. The, uh, up until, you know, recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I find a little present on the floor sometimes when I come home.#Statement-non-opinion
But she's, she's usually pretty good.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well. My, my mother has one that's, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it's, uh, it's, uh, teacup#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it's made such a difference for her.#Statement-non-opinion
But, you know, just, I, e-, e-, you know,#Uninterpretable
the way my mom's presence countenance is, just, just for having a puppy#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, having this dog#Uninterpretable
she's had it for, I guess three years now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, possibly four.#Other
But, uh, it was, it, it's it's really made such a difference for her.#Statement-non-opinion
I really would like to, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm a disabled person#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I'm unable to, to, really take care of a pet#Statement-non-opinion
and if that weren't so, I would certainly have one.#Statement-non-opinion
I just, I just,#Uninterpretable
it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog#Statement-non-opinion
yeah .#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Huh. Well, you might want to get yourself, uh, an animal that doesn't require much attention. Like a cat.#Action-directive
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I, I, I typically am not a cat person.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I have a friend that, uh, has on occasion, uh brought her cat over for me to keep for, you know, from time to time#Statement-non-opinion
And this cat is like no other cat I have ever seen.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, it would sleep on my chest,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's just, it's just a great cat,#Statement-non-opinion
but.#Uninterpretable
Well, my, my personal preference is, is a dog.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I don't know that, uh, that I would ever want a cat.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I like cats.#Statement-non-opinion
I just wouldn't want to own one.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh#Statement-opinion
Well, you don't own cats.#Statement-opinion
they're not, uh, they're, they're affectionate#Other
but they,#Uninterpretable
yeah#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
I can't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You, they, they own you#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right#Agree/Accept
or, or, you know,#Other
.#Non-verbal
grant you with you their presence, you know.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Right.#Agree/Accept
That,#Uninterpretable
yes,#Uninterpretable
we're supposed to appreciate them.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, my, my dog when I came home, uh, when I come home in the evenings, my dog greets me at the door.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know that a cat would do that, uh#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I used to have,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I could just walk in the door#Statement-non-opinion
and she knew whether to, to, to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I mean she really could pick up on my mood#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, the way I walked in the door.#Other
It was, uh, uncanny#Statement-opinion
Huh. I, I think, uh, in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because, uh, she knows when I'm upset and I know when she's not feeling good too#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know like when she has an accident, I know she's not doing it on purpose.#Statement-non-opinion
When#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when she was younger, she used to do that to get even with me,#Other
.#Non-verbal
Uh, and, and, you know, some people might not believe that#Statement-non-opinion
but, but, but, uh, I do#Statement-non-opinion
Sure#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, absolutely.#Appreciation
Like if I, if I put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours, uh, because I was going out. She would, uh, break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to, uh, to, to let me know that she was unhappy with what I did#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
That's the way,#Uninterpretable
well, I had that cat that I mentioned, Alfie .#Statement-non-opinion
One morning, you know, the first thing you do is you get up and you, you, you feed this cat some-, something and, and you make sure that it can get to its litter box.#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for some reason during the night, the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through#Other
and, uh, the next morning, uh, when my roommate got up and, and, uh, did not feed it right away, it decided that, that it was going to protest.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
for me. Looking, looking at me eye to eye,#Other
.#Non-verbal
all the time while it was doing it.#Other
All right. Have I got your attention now?#Quotation
Oh, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Animals have a way of talking#Statement-opinion
Alfie did.#Statement-non-opinion
I tell you if I could have gotten a hold of that cat that day.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I don't know that I'd, uh, that I'd trade my dog in for the world.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, it was about two years ago she got sick on me#Statement-non-opinion
and I took her to the, uh, to the vet's because she wasn't eating and, and, uh, she wasn't able to jump.#Statement-non-opinion
She, you know, lost all her activity#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, she stayed there for one day#Statement-non-opinion
and the doctor called me up and said, uh, she had a low white cell count and that, uh, she wasn't, she was dying and, uh, suggested that I take her to a working hos-, dog hospital, animal hospital#Statement-non-opinion
So I took his suggestion#Statement-non-opinion
and I, uh, took the, the dog to a hospital. The dog hospital there#Statement-non-opinion
and they said they'd keep her there for three days.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care#Statement-non-opinion
It cost me over five hundred dollars.#Statement-non-opinion
Ouch.#Appreciation
Plus, the, the, uh, the vet sent me a bill for what he did#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, then she recouped.#Statement-non-opinion
She was okay for a couple of years.#Statement-non-opinion
And then she got sick on me again#Statement-non-opinion
and I brought her to a different vet this time#Statement-non-opinion
and I told the vet what medication I had given her and everything#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, he gave me the medication, the same medication that I gave her the last time#Statement-non-opinion
and she was okay#Statement-non-opinion
and she's been okay every since.#Statement-non-opinion
It's been about two years now.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh. Well, that's great,#Appreciation
it really is.#Appreciation
I, I'm glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, the, see the problem is if, if the, if someone would have came up to me and said it's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive.#Statement-non-opinion
What do you want to do?#Quotation
I probably would have had second thoughts.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Of course, you would.#Agree/Accept
But what they, well, what they do is, is they say, well it's going to cost, you know, twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, you know, and it creeps up on you.#Statement-non-opinion
You don't know that, uh, you know#Statement-non-opinion
You really, y-, you don't know what it's going to until it's all over.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Uh, to give you an example. My mom had an elderly cat who, uh, whoever evidently got a hold of it#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, the cat got sick.#Statement-non-opinion
So she took the cat to the vet#Statement-non-opinion
and she had the cat there for two days#Statement-non-opinion
and then the cat died.#Statement-non-opinion
So the doctor had called her up and said, uh, your cat died#Statement-non-opinion
and you owe me this bill,#Quotation
and oh, by the way, do you want me to, to bury the cat#Quotation
.#Non-verbal
So, it cost her three hundred dollars, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and she didn't get the cat back.#Statement-non-opinion
So, yeah,#Uninterpretable
they had to pay for all the medical, uh, bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And, uh, you know, she just brought the cat in because he wasn't feeling good#Statement-non-opinion
So that#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Geez.#Appreciation
that was kind of a surprise#Other
At lea-,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You kind of wonder what really happened.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Well even the, you know,#Uninterpretable
they, they claimed they did the best that they could have have#Statement-non-opinion
and then the cat, uh, died.#Statement-non-opinion
So#Uninterpretable
My goodness.#Appreciation
I'm, I'm looking for another cat for them. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I, I've, I've got a little kitten, uh, that's still, uh, just being born right now.#Statement-non-opinion
So another five or six weeks I'll be bringing the little kitten over to, uh, to my folks.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that, that, that, that will make their day.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I, I think it will#Statement-opinion
because they're both in their, in their seventies. And, uh, the cat, uh, although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes, it turns, it turns out to be, uh, uh, a pleasant experience for them.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I think they enjoy that.#Statement-opinion
Only work initially.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
For cats anyway, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, listen#Action-directive
it's been a pleasure talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Well, the same here.#Conventional-closing
And you take care.#Conventional-closing

because I'm down at N C State.#Statement-non-opinion

uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so I took a class,#Statement-non-opinion

and just talk for five minutes.#Other
So are you ready?#Yes-No-Question
I'm ready.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Okay,#Uninterpretable
let's get started.#Action-directive
All right,#Agree/Accept
okay.#Agree/Accept
Okay,#Uninterpretable
so, uh, what do you think, that, uh,#Open-Question
what do, what do, what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America?#Open-Question
Oh, if I knew that I'd be a very wealthy person.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but what, what, what are the steps?#Open-Question
Well, you have to see,#Statement-opinion
I, the way I look at it, you have to think first of all why, *#Other
or ha-, has crime increased,#Rhetorical-Questions
and if so, why has crime increased?#Rhetorical-Questions
Well, see the problem is, is that, um, what happens is as, that you're, uh, you know, as you go from the country to a city, crime always increases, right?#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because in the country, people still respect, uh, the property of other people.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so, as, as,#Uninterpretable
and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities,#Statement-opinion
and they rush to get the same thing.#Statement-opinion
They say, why can't we have the same things that these other people have,#Statement-opinion
and the thing that we can do is, we need money for drugs,#Statement-opinion
and what we have to do is, we have to go, uh, get some stuff, steal it, and then, you know, just resell it.#Statement-opinion
It's easy,#Summarize/reformulate
you said the magic word there.#Statement-opinion
Which one?#Wh-Question
Drugs.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased.#Statement-opinion
That's, uh, that's, uh, the main reason I think, uh, everywhere#Statement-opinion
because, uh, you have deaths.#Statement-opinion
I mean, I mean, you have murders#Statement-opinion
and you have, you know, people stealing other people's stuff,#Statement-opinion
and that's#Uninterpretable
a lot of it has to do with drugs.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
It doesn't have to do,#Uninterpretable
I mean, the thing is is that, you know, it's like you might be standing somewhere, right,#Statement-opinion
and like let's say you, you're, you're, you know, you're driving out#Statement-opinion
and you're driving back home#Statement-opinion
and it's late at night.#Statement-opinion
And you stop by one of these, you know, twenty-four hour, you know, gas stations joints.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, somebody walks in there with a gun.#Statement-opinion
I mean, they're going to want the money,#Statement-opinion
and you can tell by the people who are always caught, that these people are there to get money for drugs.#Statement-opinion
I mean, they don't want the money so, uh, so they can do something else with it.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
they don't want the money for food,#Statement-opinion
that's for sure.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right,#Agree/Accept
and so.#Uninterpretable
Well, but you know, the, the strange thing, uh, perhaps, not strange, but something that many people don't realize, is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids,#Statement-opinion
because, uh, I'm a retired educator.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay#Response Acknowledgement
And, in fifty-one and fifty-two, the police came to the high school where I was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs, how to recognize the pushers#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
outside the one entrance, that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started, and so on, and so on.#Other
So it's a problem that's been around for over forty years,#Statement-opinion
and we're just really, uh, uh, now, trying to, uh, figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's a, there's a, uh, a song that I know which says, you know, tha-,#Statement-non-opinion
it's like, in, uh, nineteen eighty-eight, nineteen eighty-nine, the local, state, and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in America,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, their figures, I think are too, so#Statement-opinion
I mean it's like, compared to, you know, compared to, weapons or stuff like that, I mean, you're spending nothing on, on crime in the country itself.#Statement-opinion
What you're doing is, you, you know,#Uninterpretable
it's like, you have other things, you know,#Statement-opinion
you have the AIDS#Statement-opinion
we're going to solve, try to solve#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the AIDS problem while, while, you know, some people are getting killed here and there#Other
and then#Uninterpretable
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers, the big dealers in drugs,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
may be, may be part of the power structure that's keeping us from spending the money in that direction.#Other
But those people never get caught.#Statement-opinion
The people that#Uninterpretable
That's right,#Agree/Accept
they'll never get caught.#Statement-opinion
that, that I,#Other
see, their theory is that if I'm surrounded, and I'm going to be caught, I'm going to try to find my way through,#Statement-opinion
and they're not going to take me alive.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I have such a big army outside of my place, that nobody can touch me.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
But they'll,#Uninterpretable
You know, it's like,#Statement-opinion
of course, I mean I might be, you know, the the leading drug dealer here,#Statement-opinion
but you won't find me dealing in drugs,#Statement-opinion
I mean, there's no connection#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept

Um, I don't know,#Hedge
I, I think I make things, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I do things kind of simple because I, you know, I just have close friends over.#Statement-non-opinion
I make like lasagna#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, oh, we like to have barbecues outside so, you know, when the weather's nice because in Texas you have a lot of nice weather,#Statement-non-opinion
so, we do a lot of, um, things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I'm not really into gourmet cooking,#Statement-non-opinion
so, I don't know how to do that,#Statement-non-opinion
so, I don't have gourmet foods#Statement-non-opinion
Do you do Tex-Mex?#Yes-No-Question
Um, yeah,#Yes answers
you know, like fajitas and stuff like that,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Oh, fajitas,#Repeat-phrase

Um, it's kind of like made out of skirt steak#Statement-non-opinion
and you marinate it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You can buy marinating mixes here#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
get it up there.#Other
Uh, you can, you know, marinate it in any kind of barbecue sauce you like#Statement-non-opinion
and then you, uh, you quick fry it real fast with, in hot, hot grease. You know, not a who-, not, not deep frying it#Statement-non-opinion
but you can either barbecue it which is really good,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Other
with, uh, green beans, not green beans but green peppers and red peppers and onions.#Other
Uh-huh.#Other
And, uh, then you put it on a flour, like, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
you make your meat real, uh, thin, you know, bite-size pieces.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Then you put it on flour tortillas with, you know, guacamole and, uh, sour cream and, you know, all kinds of, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it's like a Tex-Mex type thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, it sounds good.#Appreciation
It's really good.#Statement-non-opinion
You can do it with chicken too.#Statement-non-opinion
Chicken fajitas and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
Well, that's nice.#Appreciation
So, what kind of cooking do you do up there?#Wh-Question
Oh, well, basically, um, because I lived in the Middle East for a while I tend to fix Middle Eastern foods when I have,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Other
have people over.#Other
that sounds interesting.#Other
And so, um, some of the dips are like chick peas mashed with, um, sesame.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, cold foo-, um,#Uninterpretable
what's it called,#Self-talk

It's called ,#Statement-non-opinion
now I remember it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, dipping Arabic bread, the thin piece of bread in that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or another dip is made with, very similar but with, um, eggplant which has been actually barbe-,#Statement-non-opinion
it ends up with a barbecued taste.#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
although we usually bake it in the oven#Statement-non-opinion
or if we have, uh,#Uninterpretable
those of us that have gas stoves bake it on top just like putting it in the gas flame and sort of getting it black,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on the outside but mushy on the inside.#Other
Oh, that's unusual I'd never heard of anything like that, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Here in Texas it's all, you know, Tex-Mex cooking and barbecue#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Other
.#Non-verbal
they're really big on stuff like that#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
But barbecue is it like steaks#Yes-No-Question
or is it,#Or-Clause
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you barbecue s-,#Uninterpretable
uh, turkey?#Other
Pardon me?#Signal-non-understanding
Would you barbecue a turkey or a chicken#Or-Clause
or,#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah,#Yes answers
you can barbecue turkey if you have a big enough grill#Statement-non-opinion
but my, I cook my turkeys inside, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it b-,#Uninterpretable
you can buy smoked turkeys.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And or, uh, but most the stuff that we barbecue is like steak and chicken and hamburgers, hot dogs,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
the simple things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, we, we like things like that.#Other
You know, barbecue beans and baked beans#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm sure that the chicken that we barbecue from the Middle East has a lemon garlic sauce.#Statement-non-opinion
I wouldn't imagine that a barbecued chicken would.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#No answers
no,#No answers
this is more like hickories, hickory type, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
depending on the barbe-,#Statement-non-opinion
it's like a smokey flavor,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you've ever, you know, had stuff like that.#Other
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
it's totally different.#Statement-non-opinion
Sounds like it would be interesting to eat some of the Middle Eastern cooking,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, it's been fun talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
it's been fun,#Conventional-closing
it's been nice,#Conventional-closing
it's, uh, you know, new to learn some, what different people eat,#Conventional-closing
so.#Conventional-closing
Right.#Conventional-closing
You get to think, you know,#Other
I come from Wyoming#Conventional-closing
and it's basically the same, same type of thing except for you do eat more the Tex-Mex down here,#Conventional-closing
so.#Conventional-closing
Uh, in Wyoming it would be less spicy?#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
yeah,#Conventional-closing
you, you know,#Conventional-closing
down there it's just like meat and potatoes, you know.#Conventional-closing
Vegetables once in a while.#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
right#Conventional-closing
Oh, dear.#Conventional-closing
Well, it's been interesting to talk to you.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
very good.#Conventional-closing
Thank you for calling.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay,#Other
Scott, let's, uh, talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university#Action-directive
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you have any?#Yes-No-Question
and,#Uninterpretable
Do you have any kids#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
I have some, yes, some children.#Statement-non-opinion
I have three boys.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they're all quite young#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so we want to plan for their education#Statement-non-opinion
or we're saving right now#Statement-non-opinion
and we're getting bonds, and, and, uh, and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to.#Statement-non-opinion
How about yourself?#Open-Question
Do you have any kids?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I'm in, I'm in graduate school right now#Statement-non-opinion
So I imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
your own college.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
definitely.#Agree/Accept
In fact, I'm even going, uh, selecting again for, for my P H D.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, it's a close subject right now#Statement-non-opinion
Very good.#Appreciation
Uh,#Uninterpretable
What, uh, what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to?#Wh-Question
Well I use, uh, uh, uh, I have used, uh, several techniques depending on what,#Statement-non-opinion
for undergraduate, I, I, you know, my criteria were much different than#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than like for graduate school.#Other
Uh, when I, when I wanted to go to an undergraduate institution, I was looking for something that was, you know, rather small and easy to get around, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And what I would, what I thought would be easy to get through.#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what you thought, huh.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah#Agree/Accept
And, and, uh, my choice of graduate schools was, uh, you know, it changed a whole lot.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I got to where I, I wanted to, uh, graduate with a little, you know, with a name behind me, rather than, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Just the degree itself.#Collaborative Completion
yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well, that's a, that's, that's good, because I did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I wanted to get a school that was small enough, that was personable#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you didn't have a lecture, uh, hall with about fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, but you, I felt that I got a pretty good, uh, undergraduate, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Where, where did you go?#Wh-Question
I went to Utah State University#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
which is in Logan, Utah#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the nice thing about it too is, I knew that I wanted to get into business and that their business, College of Business, was accredited#Statement-non-opinion
and well known#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at least there in the State of Utah#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and around the surrounding states and so forth.#Other
And so I, I feel like, number one, you ne-, you also need to see what kind of name the,#Statement-non-opinion
like you mentioned before, the name the college and university can, can give you#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and another thing that, uh, another reason why I chose that was the, the finances.#Other
I wanted to make sure that I would be able to afford it, that I wouldn't get through four, three years of the undergraduate work and, and have to leave.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, so I did a lot of talking with friends, with family#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with, uh, counselors at high school, and also read some, some books on, on the subject at the, at the library.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, it was kind of unusual because my, my two older brothers and I all went to thr-, three different universities, depending on what our choice was.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Hopefully we, we chose the one that was best for us,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I felt very comfortable and good about that.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you, do you worry, do you worry any about, uh, uh, being able,#Yes-No-Question
I mean, obviously you've taken precautions, you know, or measures to, uh, try and pay for your children's education,#Statement-non-opinion
but do you think that that's going to be enough?#Yes-No-Question
I don't think so.#Negative non-no answers
No.#Repeat-phrase
I don't know.#Other answers
The, the way that tuition is increasing, um, exponentially#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, it's, it's kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at the same pace that the college tuition is increasing.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, uh,#Uninterpretable
I, all I, all I can hope for is that I land a professorship at a nice heavy university.#Statement-non-opinion
And that, that your children can use the benefits of#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
that university.#Other
Well, that's an excellent idea,#Appreciation
that's an excellent idea.#Appreciation
One thing that, uh, that we did, uh, and my parents, and our family, is that we weren't able to afford, um, the kind of education that we all desired.#Statement-non-opinion
So my parents stressed that we get excellent grades so that we apply and try for scholarships#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education, because my parents couldn't.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And what the scholarship could not supply I was able to, to work for and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and save and, and, and get.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Also, my, my brother, um, he's a, he's a medical doctor right now.#Statement-non-opinion
He had to, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree, he had to take out some loans,#Statement-non-opinion
and he's, he's working to pay those off.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I, I think that the, uh, you know, once you get past, uh, the initial stages of it, that there's different options you can use#Statement-opinion
and, and, uh#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the student loans are, are good options.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's what, that's my biggest option right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and as you're well aware that tuition's not,#Statement-opinion

What are you guys having for Christmas?#Open-Question

Let's see#Hold before answer/agreement
Well, I'm not planning the menu.#Statement-non-opinion

No#No answers
We usually go out to ei-, either one of our folks,#Statement-non-opinion
they both live close to#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, um, I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
it seems like a, a big thing for Christmas is usually ham.#Statement-opinion
Well, funny you should mention that.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm a pig farmer#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you are#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, now, it's kind of a hobby more than anything else,#Statement-non-opinion
but we're going to have, uh, wild boar#Statement-non-opinion
My goodness.#Appreciation
we, uh, we killed a boar the other day,#Statement-non-opinion
it was, you know, mating with the sows,#Statement-non-opinion
and you can't use the piglets, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's about six months of no use,#Statement-non-opinion
so, we, uh, we shot him and cleaned him out and had him, you know, processed into ham,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig, because I, I've got one that's got a, a hernia#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Backchannel in question form
and rather than, you know, pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery, we'll just cook him and eat him#Statement-non-opinion
Is that, is that hard?#Yes-No-Question
Well, no,#No answers
hey, I tell you what, preparing a little pig is, is a snap,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I'm telling you, real easy, easier than chicken.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
you just, uh,#Uninterpretable
you kill him, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
you probably,#Uninterpretable
most guys just shoot them in the head,#Statement-non-opinion
they go, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
in a second they're gone#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then you just dip the carcass in, uh, boiling water, pull it out, and there's a, we use a little raspy brush, pulls the hair off, and, uh, gut it, and, uh, just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and, uh, some pineapple, about three pineapples, you know, sliced them up, and, uh, cover him up with, uh, wet, uh, sacks, feed sacks is what I usually use *#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then start a charcoal fire on top of him.#Other
Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
And after about six hours, you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's the best eating you ever had.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, does a boar taste just like regular ham?#Yes-No-Question
Yep,#Yes answers
just like a pig#Statement-non-opinion
Does it.#Backchannel in question form
I mean, you know, uh, it has a lot less fat.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds#Statement-non-opinion
Oh my.#Appreciation
and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
Well, you know, we took the skin and the head and the le-, and the feet off,#Statement-non-opinion
and that was about, you know, a hundred, hundred pounds of just ham.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, how many people are you planning on serving at Christmas?#Wh-Question
Oh, well, we're, you know, we're not going to eat the whole thing#Statement-non-opinion
Eat it all,#Repeat-phrase
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It would take a year.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, you know, we're going to drive up to Kansas City, see my wife's folks,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, she, she,#Uninterpretable
what's, what's what's your mother cooking for Christmas#Wh-Question

Brisket?#Backchannel in question form
It's a part of the cow that they used to throw away.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's just tough as a boot#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, you know, they used to use it for leather, I think#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
I mean, no,#Reject
I was kidding.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, it's, it's a part of the loin, you know, the rib cage,#Statement-non-opinion
and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
gristle where it attaches to the ribs,#Other
so it's really, really a tough piece of meat#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
but it's so tasty, you can't stand it.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So you just take it#Statement-non-opinion
and you marinate it for a couple of days#Statement-non-opinion
And that softens it up, huh.#Summarize/reformulate
.#Non-verbal
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then, uh, you just put it in the oven,#Statement-non-opinion
takes about four hours to cook one.#Statement-non-opinion
They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gee.#Appreciation
And, uh, we're going to have that.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, what else do you serve with your pig?#Wh-Question
Oh, well, we'll have cranberries and hominy#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we, we are, we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here.#Statement-non-opinion

fresh tomatoes.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, we, we just got lots of snow#Statement-non-opinion
Well, it started to freeze up around here, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
there's nothing between you and us but our barb wire, and half of that's down.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it's thirty degrees this morning.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
I didn't know it got that low at night.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well, it's desert, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
where, where we are, it's, it's, it's, uh, the edge of the desert,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it's part of the Great Plains.#Statement-non-opinion
So in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred, hundred and ten#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gee.#Appreciation
and at night it goes down to about sixty.#Statement-non-opinion
My goodness.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
we get a fifty de-, degree temperature swing in about four hours.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, boy.#Appreciation
So everything that lives around here is real tough#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's trees, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
we got hundred year old trees that are, you know, twenty feet tall.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gee.#Appreciation

we like him.#Statement-non-opinion
Does he shed a lot?#Yes-No-Question
He does.#Affirmative non-yes answers
That's the one thing we don't like about him.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
He'd probably look pretty funny if we did that.#Statement-opinion
How much does he weigh now?#Wh-Question
He, actually, he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
and they put him on the scale#Statement-non-opinion

Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But he's not a real, he's not a real tall, uh, dog for a Golden Retriever.#Statement-non-opinion

Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But,#Uninterpretable
Is he good with family?#Yes-No-Question
He is.#Affirmative non-yes answers
It's, uh, just me and my wife#Statement-non-opinion

I can#Statement-non-opinion

Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids#Statement-opinion

But, we, uh, we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday.#Statement-non-opinion
But we figure we'll get the kids and then the, the dog#Statement-non-opinion
That's probably a good idea.#Statement-opinion
They're good though.#Statement-opinion
Uh, have you ever had a Retriever before?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
but my husband had one when he was growing up.#Statement-non-opinion
Because I, I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs.#Statement-opinion
They don't tend to get real jealous or territorial.#Statement-opinion
They like to play.#Statement-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Especially with the kids.#Statement-opinion
They love to play with kids.#Statement-opinion
Is, is your dog an inside and outdoors?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
he's pretty much an inside dog.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He stays in.#Statement-non-opinion
We, we're kind of in a, not a real busy neighborhood, but more so than I'd want him to be out too much#Statement-opinion
and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
He's really a wimp.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And when it comes to being alone,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants, he likes that,#Statement-non-opinion
but he does not like to be tied outside.#Statement-non-opinion
He'll, he'll just bark and bark and bark.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, when he gets outside, does, in, does he run away and then eventually come back?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
he's, uh, taken to the training pretty well#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, he knows where our yard is#Statement-non-opinion
and we have a pretty small yard,#Statement-non-opinion
but he seems to know the boundaries.#Statement-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he usually is good about staying within them,#Statement-non-opinion
although our next door neighbors have a dog, too#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, she, she is good friends with my dog.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah?#Backchannel in question form
And so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
he's pretty good.#Other
He stays out of the street#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, if I catch him I call him#Statement-non-opinion
and he comes back.#Statement-non-opinion
So he, he's pretty good about taking to commands and#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and things.#Other
Did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or#Or-Clause
No#No answers
just#Other
we never did.#Statement-non-opinion
train him on your own#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
I, I trained him on my own#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, this is the first dog I've had all my own as an adult.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We've had kid, or we've had dogs when I was a kid,#Statement-non-opinion
but this, this is the first one that I, uh, took in,#Statement-non-opinion
so I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get it all right the first time,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, he, he seems to have picked it up pretty well.#Statement-opinion
I#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
never really to hit him or anything.#Other
Just, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
firm tone of voice and those#Other
Really?#Backchannel in question form
sorts of things.#Other
I, I see other people out there#Statement-non-opinion
and they hit their dogs and try to,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and those horrible collars that they put on them with invinc-, invisible fencing,#Statement-non-opinion
least I,#Uninterpretable
Invisible what?#Signal-non-understanding
Invisible fencing,#Statement-non-opinion
have you heard of that?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
what is that?#Wh-Question
It's, uh, it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little, uh, transducers or emitters in your yard#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at the perimeter#Other
and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it#Statement-non-opinion
and if they get too close to that perimeter, it#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it zaps them.#Other
Boy.#Appreciation
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'd be afraid to walk around if I was that dog#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog#Statement-non-opinion
and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to#Statement-non-opinion
so he held on to the collar#Statement-non-opinion
and he walked out to the perimeter.#Statement-non-opinion
He said it was a good jolt.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
and so, I, I don't take too well to, to those#Statement-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sorts of training techniques.#Other
I don't think they're always necessary.#Statement-opinion
If you put enough patience into,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
just be consistent and diligent#Summarize/reformulate
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
with it#Other
and, um,#Uninterpretable
It's, uh, is your cat an indoor cat or an#Or-Clause
Yeah#Yes answers
outdoor cat?#Other
he's indoor and all declawed because I know the, uh, average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months.#Statement-non-opinion
Somebody just told me that#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because of the leukemia?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
that and also just, uh, getting hit, I guess, or getting beat up.#Statement-opinion
And the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
So,#Uninterpretable
Quite a difference.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
What, uh, what kind of climate do you have?#Wh-Question
Well, uh, it's, we just moved recently#Statement-non-opinion
so now we're in the, uh, Dallas area#Statement-non-opinion
and it's very#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
very nice#Other
and,#Uninterpretable

Do you have any?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
we do have a pet.#Statement-non-opinion
We have a, a dog that we got from the, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
well, we call it the S P C A.#Statement-non-opinion
It's the, uh, an-, from an animal shelter.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, he'd come in there as a stray.#Statement-non-opinion
All right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, well, he was very well trained when we got him.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, he's,#Uninterpretable
Oh, that's good.#Appreciation
You don't often find that,#Statement-opinion
I don't think.#Hedge
No, uh,#Agree/Accept
we suspect that he was hurt in an accident, you know, got away from somebody traveling through, and hurt in an accident#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, if they were local people, they would have been able to find him.#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Agree/Accept
There's a,#Uninterpretable
okay, uh,#Uninterpretable
that's interesting.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
the only pet that I've had, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm a, I'm a doctoral student right now#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and in my, in my earlier days as a student I kind of time shared on a dog with a, a good friend of mine#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it was an amazing dog,#Statement-non-opinion
it really was.#Statement-non-opinion
They had, he had gotten it from the pound#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it, it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Kind of looks like a dom-, a Dalmatian#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we trained it from a pup,#Statement-non-opinion
and basically it, right now it, it's fully trained#Statement-non-opinion
and it can do a lot of things.#Statement-non-opinion
It will get beer for you out of the fridge,#Statement-non-opinion
and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
So, it's really, it's, it's kind of a show piece#Statement-non-opinion
any-, -more, and whenever anybody comes over, we all have to show him Domino you know .#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I think so.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
she's been a real good, a real good dog#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, just, it's kind of a shame that I'm, I'm go-, I'm away from it now.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I j-, I actually live in Florida#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
but I'm on an internship up here for a year#Statement-non-opinion
and then I go back down,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
Domino's a real good dog.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, what, uh, possessed you to get the dog?#Wh-Question
Well, I guess, in one sense we felt that, it, it's nice to have a dog even though there are, you know, complications come with it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then with our children, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
at the time they were, oh, grade five and, and grade eight,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was an age where it was, uh, we thought it was be good for them to have the discipline that goes with, with having a pet.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Sure learn a bit, learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
That's good.#Statement-opinion
That kind of builds some#Statement-opinion
So ,#Uninterpretable
character a little bit.#Other
Well, that's the idea.#Agree/Accept
I think the reality of it is, that they perhaps,#Statement-opinion
uh, it depends on the,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
on everyone's discipline.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, from that aspect, I'm short on the discipline, because I don't, uh, enforce that the kids look after the dog#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we've had him about four years now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but I think it does, it, it, you know,#Statement-opinion
it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly, uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's something that's important for sure.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think, uh, do you live in a, in a, in a fairly rural part of the, uh#Yes-No-Question
Uh,#Uninterpretable
or,#Uninterpretable
Actually no,#Negative non-no answers
we live in a, in an area that's, oh, probably about two and a half miles from the university.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Response Acknowledgement
Uh, we live right, might say we live right in, uh, in the middle of a residential area.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
And, uh, so that is not as good, uh, you know,#Statement-opinion
this dog, being a small dog it's, uh, more you, more acceptable#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but again,#Hedge
it's not that big of a problem.#Statement-opinion
With Domino, she was full grown,#Statement-non-opinion
I would estimate seventy pounds.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, we lived in Oviedo, which is a small town,#Statement-non-opinion
it's a suburb of Orlando#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but there's not, there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around,#Statement-non-opinion
and she was a dog that loved to run,#Statement-non-opinion
so that was the biggest problem I saw,#Statement-opinion
and I think that's one of the, uh, the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is, you know, do you have the room for this dog to run around,#Statement-opinion
or, s-, you know, I guess you can't really say for cats.#Statement-opinion
Me and cats don't get along too well, uh#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, that whole space issue, I think, is real important.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, uh, that's one of the biggest concerns.#Statement-opinion
It's like, uh,#Uninterpretable
there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal,#Statement-opinion
but the same time, one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of the animal#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, that,#Uninterpretable
and the larger they are, the more room they need to exercise.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure,#Agree/Accept
and that's all part of y-, of keeping your part of the relationship.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those, uh, those issues.#Other
Well ,#Uninterpretable
You know, and also, the whole, whole thing with noise.#Statement-non-opinion
My mother, oh, she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs, that don't train them#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, we h-, we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had, uh, Brittany Spaniels#Statement-non-opinion
and they're very high strung animals to begin with,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable

Colorado Springs.#Other
Oh, right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
up in, uh, T I out there?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Oh, right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Did you hit one.#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
I just hit one then.#Statement-non-opinion
All right.#Response Acknowledgement
Uh,#Uninterpretable
The savings and loan scandal.#Statement-non-opinion
It,#Uninterpretable
I, got to, uh,#Uninterpretable
this is going to be fun.#Statement-opinion
Are you Republican or Democrat?#Or-Clause
Uh, kind of neither.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
well, I'm a, I'm a Democrat#Statement-non-opinion
so I was going to say if you're a Republican, boy we would really have a good time.#Statement-non-opinion
I do have some Republican leanings, because,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I am division one, you know#Other
Well, I, uh,#Uninterpretable
to answer that one before we get to our subject, you know, I always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was, though when it comes to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money#Statement-non-opinion
and they're the ones wasting all the money.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And, I always wondered how they can play the money either way they want, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
I get a kick out of that.#Statement-non-opinion
But, anyway, the subject, go ahead.#Action-directive
You first.#Action-directive
Uh, I think it's a stinking shame that there isn't capital punishment for those assholes that stold our money.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, uh, I don't think it's over.#Statement-opinion
I think that, uh, so many other things have taken over, uh, in the media.#Statement-opinion
But, I think it was just plain greed,#Statement-opinion
and I think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks.#Statement-opinion
Go ahead loan your money out, you know.#Statement-opinion
I agree with you.#Agree/Accept
I think it had something to do with deregulation,#Statement-opinion
but I believe, uh, more of it was just greed.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was talking to someone,#Statement-non-opinion
I can't remember who it was,#Statement-non-opinion
but he was a small businessman,#Statement-non-opinion
and he said that the banks were calling,#Statement-non-opinion
he borrowed some money#Statement-non-opinion
and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away.#Statement-non-opinion
They just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, yeah,#Uninterpretable
there, there should be thousands of people in jail as far as I'm concerned.#Statement-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
Not just a couple.#Statement-opinion
You know, we've watched and watched T V and seen that a lot of these people were doing things, not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit, but financing the same property three and four times,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
and the list goes on and on.#Statement-non-opinion
Well I, I agree a hundred percent.#Agree/Accept
You know, of, of just the crimes committed.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Much less for criminals that should be indicted.#Other
It may have started with HUD too.#Statement-opinion
I noticed that HUD was in terrible shape#Statement-opinion
and that was property#Uninterpretable
and, uh, they lost a lot of money there,#Statement-opinion
and then some of these big, these rich people started to,#Statement-opinion
even Murchison here, who owned the Cowboys, had a lot of property down in Florida.#Statement-non-opinion
This was several years ago#Statement-non-opinion
and he lost, you know, all, all of his money before he died.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Not all of it,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know how much he lost,#Hedge
but, uh, they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit#Statement-opinion
and it always would, it always would increase, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it always would, uh, uh, be more than what you paid for it#Statement-non-opinion
and they just never even got conservative with our money at all.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It,#Uninterpretable
everyone forgets whose money it was.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny American word.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
as far as being a Republican or a Democrat, I think no American could stand for criminal action.#Statement-opinion
Well now the reason that I said that is because I was going to blame all, uh, Reaganomics for, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
you spend your way to prosperity#Statement-opinion
and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls, I thought, well, that was the philosophy, you know.#Statement-opinion
Just keep spending until taxes are lower,#Statement-opinion
and, I thought, that's not going to work, you know,#Statement-opinion
and I knew that it wasn't going to work originally.#Statement-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
And, it hasn't worked now.#Statement-opinion
In theory, in theory, a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
no doubt,#Appreciation
no doubt.#Appreciation
And, if people are making money, people can spend money,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and it'll generate taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
I, I, I agree with that,#Statement-opinion
but there's got to be some control#Statement-opinion
and apparently there was, you know,#Statement-opinion
Well, the problem is,#Statement-opinion
and the problem with Reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, for what they would cost#Statement-opinion
and we weren't producing anything.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We, as Americans weren't producing anything.#Statement-opinion
It was all inflation.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, I'm sorry we don't get into a real argument over it,#Statement-non-opinion
we agree too closely,#Statement-opinion
but,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I know, uh,#Statement-opinion
But, you, you can't say that that was right.#Other
Oh, no,#Appreciation
I,#Uninterpretable
No intelligent person can say that we could spend our way rich.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Remember all we're doing is delivering pizzas to each other.#Statement-opinion
And, and not high quality ones at that, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well,#Uninterpretable
Well, I do have a lot of confidence in the, the American people and the economy and everything else.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I feel bad when I see the inefficiency, even here at T I, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think that the,#Statement-opinion
it, it still,#Uninterpretable
a lot of the workers don't understand that, uh, they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them, you know.#Statement-opinion
It is a life and death struggle,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with Jap-, with the Japanese.#Other
I know,#Appreciation
and I, when I,#Uninterpretable
of course I'm in facilities,#Statement-non-opinion
and I work with a lot of mechanics#Statement-non-opinion
and I just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and they think that, well, I'm paid anyway#Statement-non-opinion
so it doesn't matter, you know.#Quotation
I, I'm very tired of it all pays by the hour.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and I'm nonexempt.#Statement-non-opinion

You don't sound like a nonexempt.#Statement-opinion
What, what does a nonexempt sound like?#Wh-Question
Uh, you're too informed.#Statement-opinion
They're, they're very, they're very, uh, not interested.#Statement-opinion
They wouldn't even talk probably about some of the things we're talking about now.#Statement-opinion

I guess I'm dealing with too many Texas mechanics here.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know really.#Hedge
Uh, that's,#Uninterpretable
I'm being a Yankee, I guess I'm, I'm letting my Yankee come out, you know.#Statement-non-opinion

I don't care what the jobs are, you will not work.#Quotation

And, and, as far as our, you know, our conversation goes, I would really be interested to know how much of T I's problems now are related to,#Statement-non-opinion
Banking?#Yes-No-Question
the banking structure.#Other
I think that, not, not only T I, but a lot of it, when they talk about, uh,#Statement-opinion
there was one point I was going to make.#Statement-non-opinion
I think the last I heard,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I have to admit I'm not as informed as them,#Statement-non-opinion
but there's something like about eighty six billion that they admit.#Statement-opinion
Well, I always double that.#Statement-non-opinion
I figure well, if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty-six billion, it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes#Statement-opinion
and so if that's true, it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was, that went down the tube somewhere.#Statement-opinion
Uh, it really hurts me,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's amazing really.#Statement-opinion
It's amazing that,#Statement-opinion
to realize that a lot of people out there are trying to retire on their home values.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know what you mean.#Backchannel in question form
Uh, one of our senior,#Statement-non-opinion

And, I don't know how,#Statement-non-opinion
Seattle.#Statement-non-opinion
Bell didn't get it.#Other
Seattle,#Statement-non-opinion
and also, uh, they do some of that in Wichita, Kansas.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I, I don't,#Uninterpretable
they were advertising here that it was Bell, T I.#Statement-non-opinion
T I was getting the, uh, electronics with Bell,#Statement-non-opinion
and so, it was a double.#Statement-non-opinion
One that Bell is in the Metroplex#Statement-non-opinion
and two, that T I was doing the electronics for them.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, they, they advertised that, that it was T I Bell, T I Bell and then all of a sudden, Secorski got it, yeah.#Statement-non-opinion
Secorski Boeing.#Collaborative Completion
Secorski, Boeing,#Agree/Accept
Boeing doesn't need the money.#Statement-non-opinion
Something,#Uninterpretable
I almost think there's some politics around here, because the metroplex here, in the Dallas, Fort Worth area, the, uh, with T I,#Statement-opinion
I don't know if T I has lost as much as everybody else,#Hedge
but General Dynamics and L T V and Bell have lost project after project, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you realize ...#Uninterpretable

What do you think about it?#Open-Question
Well, I, I feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately, that I think there are some occupations that they should, such as the health field, the transportation field, uh,#Statement-opinion
they're already doing it in the armed forces, where they handle weapons and so forth, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
they do it to prisoners#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, I, I, uh, I, I, I feel like it should be mandatory in some professions,#Statement-opinion
and I think if, if, uh, an employer feels that he wants to, to drug test employees and they don't like it, then they should not be employed there#Statement-opinion
That was,#Uninterpretable
you know, I would not mind it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else, you know#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
harm or injury, absolutely.#Other
And I don't have a problem at all with employers, uh, testing in the hiring process,#Statement-non-opinion
but I, I, I don't, I don't have a problem with them too much, testing even after the fact,#Statement-non-opinion
but I do a little bit where it, where it wouldn't hurt anybody.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
sometimes I think they carry it a little bit too far.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But,#Uninterpretable
unless an employer has a reason to#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
believe that his, uh, the work competency of, of the employ-, employee is, is hurting the business.#Other
Right#Agree/Accept
I mean maybe it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
and then it's not a problem.#Statement-opinion
Number one because generally if, if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and as an employer, I would think that would be,#Uninterpretable
and the first,#Uninterpretable
it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost.#Statement-opinion
Oh, absolutely.#Agree/Accept
There's no way.#Statement-opinion
But, but my concern is, uh, school bus drivers.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Tr-,#Uninterpretable
the train drivers,#Uninterpretable
Um, I'm not even,#Uninterpretable
I'm in education,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not even opposed to it for that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I'm concerned in the medical field.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, I think they should screen for alcohol in these areas, too#Statement-opinion
I wish they would.#Agree/Accept
because I consider that a drug.#Other
I wish they would,#Agree/Accept
and that, I think, is even probably more widely abused#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
by, you know, the masses#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
than, than drugs, so to speak.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
So.#Uninterpretable
But when you consider they could be driving an airplane#Statement-opinion
Oh, I know.#Agree/Accept
or driving a bus, or a train, um#Other
And,#Uninterpretable
and it doesn't take that long.#Statement-opinion
They don't have to be totally roaring drunk#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
just a little#Statement-opinion
Just, uh,#Uninterpretable
off on their timing#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and,#Uninterpretable
could, could mean life.#Other
Now T I has the random testing policy#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and, you know, our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a, in a pool#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I've already been tested once when I was hired and, and once since they initiated this random testing program.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I work with one girl who was tested, her name got, got randomly selected three times in six months#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my word.#Appreciation
and I think that's the only reason I have a problem with it, when there's no, you know, there's no reason#Statement-opinion
Control.#Summarize/reformulate
to suspect someone, you know.#Other
That, that's getting a little bit,#Statement-opinion
that's enough to make anybody paranoid#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Well, as long as you accept that it is a random, a random testing#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, you know, to, to alleviate,#Other
that way you can't feel like somebody's out to get me.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If,#Uninterpretable
it's almost like being selected for jury duty#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel,#Statement-non-opinion
that's, that's just the way it is.#Statement-opinion
Either just the lucky or the unlucky one, depending on how you look at it.#Statement-opinion
I would, I would rather have it that way, to know that I was chosen at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in#Statement-opinion
Oh, absolutely,#Agree/Accept
because I, I think there's, when you let other employees turn in people,#Other
There are so many people with, with their petty axes to grind#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
it could really get#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
out of hand.#Other
So, I, I, I would really rather know, however,#Statement-non-opinion
there's got to be some backup to say that#Uninterpretable
if, if somebody does observe you at, say at a party, uh, using drugs#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I would think that it would be their obligation to report that.#Other
To report it,#Summarize/reformulate
and I guess you'd report that to a supervisor, maybe#Statement-non-opinion
Personnel, or something,#Collaborative Completion
anonymously or something#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
because I, I would feel very uncomfortable working with someone I knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol,#Other
I'd just#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
I'd feel really uncomfortable.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
I don't know what kind of work you do,#Statement-non-opinion
but there, there would be, even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we have, we have a lot of people who work on the line.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm in accounting,#Statement-non-opinion
so it wouldn't,#Uninterpretable
you know#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something,#Other
but out on the line, they've got people working some#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
serious equipment.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
It's, it's,#Uninterpretable
I, I just think employers have to have, especially given today, the drug abuse that goes on, I just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put at#Statement-opinion
Put at risk.#Collaborative Completion
risk. *#Other
I agree#Agree/Accept
Because#Other
totally.#Other
they're the ones who are going to have the lawsuits, the insurance claims, et cetera,#Other
and, and I'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to, uh, illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse.#Statement-opinion
And in the long run, we're all paying for that#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it, I mean, it protects us in the long run hopefully#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when they do that.#Other
I, I was trying to remember, there was a court case, uh, here where I live, just a few months ago.#Statement-non-opinion
The city workers, they wanted to, um,#Uninterpretable
the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the city workers, uh, took them to court to protest, saying that it invaded their, I guess, first a-, the, the search and seizure amendment#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's still tied up in the legal channels.#Statement-non-opinion
They haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I'm curious especially since T I -s#Statement-non-opinion
To see how that's,#Uninterpretable
a local, you know, employer is also already doing it, seeing what they'll say about it especially since,#Other
Is it, is it, uh, just a small group of the employees that are concerned?#Yes-No-Question
Well, it's the whole, it's the whole city,#Negative non-no answers
seems like the whole group of city employees that's raising a stink over it.#Statement-non-opinion
They, they just don't want to be drug tested.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
So.#Uninterpretable
You know, we've never, my husband and I have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, my husband's retired from I R S agents.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
However, this isn't a problem that we have#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
either alcohol or drug,#Other
and so, we, we, in our minds we're thinking what's the big deal.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's the way I looked at it.#Agree/Accept
If I had something to hide, it's one thing,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm,#Uninterpretable
you know, you know you don't,#Uninterpretable
so it's not as big a deal,#Statement-opinion
and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether they're really concerned#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
about their rights, or whether they're really concerned about something else.#Other
And, and then they say, well, if you give them the right to do this, then they're going to take some other right away from you,#Statement-non-opinion
but I, I firm-,#Uninterpretable
I don't believe that.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything,#Statement-opinion
and, of course, the big deal, one of the big deals now, too, is to, that when you, come into a company, as you sign a paper saying that I will go take a,#Statement-non-opinion

In, in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I know and lawyers and whatnot, I think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem.#Statement-opinion
Do you?#Tag-Question
Why?#Wh-Question
Why?#Wh-Question
Well, if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to, so they could become doctors, the problem would go away.#Statement-opinion
You think the problem is not enough doctors?#Yes-No-Question
I think the problem is that the doctor v-, doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums on your h-, uh, unemp-, I mean, on your liability.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Gosh,#Appreciation
I really have a different point of view on this#Statement-non-opinion
Oh?#Backchannel in question form
Well, because I'm a nurse#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for one thing.#Other
And you think there are plenty of doctors?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, yeah,#Yes answers
I don't think there is a shortage of doctors#Statement-non-opinion
and I do know that O B, which is my field#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the doctors' health in-, the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year#Other
It's astronomical.#Appreciation
that deliver babies.#Other
Now they can't doing anything about that.#Statement-opinion
I don't think they're in a conspiracy.#Statement-opinion
I think it's our fault, because we as people just sue them.#Statement-opinion
No,#Reject
people don't sue#Statement-opinion
People are very sue, sue conscious.#Statement-opinion
lawyers sue.#Statement-opinion
If you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they wouldn't sue a one of them.#Other
Well, that's probably true, too.#Agree/Accept
You know.#Other
But people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days.#Statement-opinion
Well, sure.#Appreciation
And, so,#Uninterpretable
But, you know, when you think about reasonableness, now, I believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory.#Statement-opinion
You know what tort theory is?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
Well, a tort is when you do something wrong.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, it, uh,#Uninterpretable
an O B G Y N doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
If the baby is born dead, well, that happens.#Statement-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
If, if they have complications and,#Statement-opinion
It depends.#Maybe/Accept-part
Well, I know, I mean, there are guys that are real slobs,#Statement-non-opinion
but you know, there are also people out there that are really doing their job.#Statement-non-opinion
And the people that are really doing their job are paying for everybody else.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's true,#Agree/Accept
they are#Statement-opinion
You know,#Other
because doctors are performing many more tests.#Other
.#Non-verbal
Many of them are unnecessary,#Statement-opinion
they are doing so many C sections#Statement-non-opinion
Just to prevent a#Statement-opinion
just to#Other
a law suit.#Other
prevent.#Other
Because they have all these monitors now#Statement-non-opinion
and if anything looks even a little bit funny#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby,#Other
and#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it's costing more all around in health insurance#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for tests, for surgery, for longer hospital stay.#Other
See, I believe#Statement-non-opinion
So, it's terrible.#Statement-non-opinion
that there, there is a system already in place for health care.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, they have indigent health care.#Statement-opinion
You show up at Parkland bleeding#Statement-non-opinion
You'll get it.#Collaborative Completion
and they'll fix you.#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
You know.#Other
In fact, you'll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we have that happen.#Statement-non-opinion
We have patients that go through Parkland#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
through the clinic#Other
and at the last minute, they come to us.#Statement-non-opinion
Well#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
uh, we can't turn them away.#Other
So,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the problem would pretty much evaporate.#Other
I'm for that.#Agree/Accept
I've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'd like to wipe them all out#Other
Well, I, I happen to know a few#Statement-non-opinion
and I even claim one as a friend.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
He's a divorce attorney.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But,#Uninterpretable
He better not be mine#Statement-non-opinion
I think he'll go nameless for the, for the purposes of this conversation.#Statement-opinion
But I also know an, uh, O B G Y N who has stopped practicing.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
some they do.#Statement-opinion
Uh, he just said,#Statement-non-opinion
They stop their O B at least.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, he's not going to deliver any more babies#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
ever.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
His malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year.#Statement-non-opinion
That's incredible.#Appreciation
And, you know, he said, I had to, he had to ear-, gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And most of them are very sincere.#Statement-opinion
Most of them do the#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
best they can.#Other
They are human.#Statement-non-opinion
This,#Statement-non-opinion
Occasionally#Statement-non-opinion
This guy is Catholic.#Other
something will go wrong.#Other
Yeah,#Other
I mean, you know,#Other
Well, you can be human and Catholic.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Other
I know you can be human and Catholic,#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
but, you're not likely to find somebody who is going to, you know, have a less conscientious effort.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
no#No answers
I mean,#Uninterpretable
most of them do.#Statement-opinion
I really believe that.#Statement-non-opinion
From dealing with doctors, dealing with lawyers, there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious.#Statement-opinion
Well, you know, who is getting rich?#Wh-Question
Insurance companies.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they are.#Agree/Accept
You know, if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance,#Statement-opinion
say, say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed#Statement-non-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable

All right,#Other
what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over?#Wh-Question
Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, uh, it's just really pretty easy.#Statement-non-opinion
It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it#Statement-non-opinion
and then I, you're supposed to do chicken,#Statement-non-opinion
but I just use those little cans of chicken.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it makes it so much easier,#Statement-non-opinion
and so you dump the rice,#Statement-non-opinion
you dump the chicken#Statement-non-opinion
and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape,#Statement-non-opinion
now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off,#Statement-non-opinion
but I get my kids to do that,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Oh#Statement-non-opinion
I, I don't have to do that.#Statement-non-opinion
And, um, and it really,#Uninterpretable
and you mix it all up with ye-,#Statement-non-opinion
there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's so simple#Statement-non-opinion
and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You serve it cold?#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Oh, yeah,#Response Acknowledgement
that sounds good.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it has to sit in the fridge over night,#Statement-non-opinion
but, but it's really good.#Statement-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
And I like that one.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Usually when we entertain we do something really simple, because I like to visit with my company,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and not be scurrying around in the kitchen,#Other
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a lot of times, we'll barbecue#Other
like, uh, for Memorial Day we had some friends over#Statement-non-opinion
and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's meat marinate,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and put it on the smoker and cooked it.#Other
Oh, that sounds good.#Appreciation
And tha-, it was real good.#Statement-non-opinion
You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way#Statement-non-opinion
and then people think they're eating steak or something#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And these days that helps, doesn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It really does.#Statement-non-opinion
I know what you mean.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Now spaghetti's such an easy one.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I do that a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do spaghetti a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it seems like most people like spaghetti.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't like to do that i-, if it's ho-, real hot though.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because, um, I don't know,#Hedge
I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in your whole house.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think that's right.#Statement-opinion
And, um, we don't entertain that often,#Statement-non-opinion
but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And something so that we can talk and not#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time.#Other
Most,#Uninterpretable
we don't entertain like people from work or stuff e-, often.#Statement-non-opinion
It's usually friends from church and stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say well what can we bring.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things#Statement-non-opinion
and everybody else brings something.#Statement-non-opinion
That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Oh yeah,#Appreciation
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh.#Uninterpretable
It's a lot more relaxing.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to m-, you know, put on this really fancy dinner for someone.#Statement-non-opinion
Well you see all that on T V#Statement-non-opinion
and I could never be that person.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It just, uh, I'm just not,#Uninterpretable
well I'm so, I'm pretty laid back.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
w-,#Uninterpretable
And, uh, you know, so I don't, I know a lady in a, my church#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, she like does her own bread and does her own stuff#Statement-non-opinion
and so when she, um, does food, she really goes all out#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't know how she can do it and be calm#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
I guess,#Other
Do you work?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I don't.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you stay home with kids?#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh,#Yes answers
yeah.#Yes answers
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I've been working,#Statement-non-opinion
we're going to have a baby this summer,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm not going to work anymore.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how exciting.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So hopefully, I think I'll enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up#Statement-non-opinion
and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I usually start about six and, an, and cook and then eat at seven.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, co-, cook at five and eat at six, rather.#Other
Eat at six, yeah.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, my family and I, we're a sit down together family.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's good.#Appreciation
Uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't like the run in and out part.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an, and my husband about what's happened#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's neat.#Appreciation
I think I, that was ingrained in me during my family time at home.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, you know we could learn to talk about things#Statement-non-opinion
and I think that's good.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that really is.#Statement-opinion
It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think,#Uninterpretable
Right now we eat in front of the T V#Statement-non-opinion
but since it's just the two of us, it's#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Well that happens to us sometimes too.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, sometimes if something, uh, is on that they want to watch I leave it on,#Statement-non-opinion
but we eat in the kitchen#Statement-non-opinion
and their heads are always poking past the door.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to see what's happening.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Anyway food is, is, uh, a real life-style kind of thing#Statement-opinion
and i-, some people don't like to do this#Statement-opinion
but I like to co-, uh, cook with my kids.#Statement-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And if they're going to have other kids over then, then they help.#Statement-non-opinion
And we make real simple things, you know, those, oh,#Statement-non-opinion
I don-, I don't know if you've ever made them, maybe not since you don't have kids yet, but those Jell-O, uh, gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers, I can't think of what they call it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I've seen those in the magazines.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're so simple.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the kids love to do that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, finger food is, is a biggie with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and like, now one thing I wish I could find a, a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks, because they love to do that#Statement-non-opinion
and it's just really hard#Statement-non-opinion
and if you have to work with a knife, I don't like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, that's, uh,#Uninterpretable
they like to eat it,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's a hard one to have to, to prepare.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Other
But they like that with the, the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My son's getting to be a, a real good cook#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh,#Uninterpretable
Oh, neat.#Appreciation
sometimes he fixes me breakfast#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow, that's great#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like it,#Statement-non-opinion
I like it a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
How old is he?#Wh-Question
He's eleven.#Statement-non-opinion
Eleven,#Repeat-phrase
wow,#Appreciation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's good.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so hi-,#Uninterpretable
Do you cook breakfa-, like you cook a breakfast every morning#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Uh, not every morning, uh,#Negative non-no answers
mostly during the summer it's hit and miss#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we usually have like, uh, cold cereal or something like that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, during the su-, during wintertime when they're in school, um, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a, twice a week or something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I like oatmeal#Other
and the loo-, they like it all right.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, then sometimes we do something,#Statement-non-opinion
it has to be fast because they're on their way to school,#Statement-non-opinion
we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that,#Statement-non-opinion
but.#Uninterpretable
Oh, uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, I try to, uh,#Uninterpretable
and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that.#Statement-non-opinion
I used to do them in the microwave,#Statement-non-opinion
but they don't like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, do they get rubbery,#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Um.#Uninterpretable
I've never tried it.#Statement-non-opinion
It de-, it depends.#Other answers
If you let them cook too long#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then they'll turn a little bit gray.#Other
You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray#Statement-non-opinion
and they will be a little harder,#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book,#Statement-non-opinion
but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, like a plate over the top.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And let it steam.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then, and then stir it up.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
an, and that turns out okay.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's funny 'cause if I turn them out on to a di-, i-, on to like a plate, for them to take what they want,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Statement-non-opinion
they don't know I've ever done it in a microwave.#Other
.#Non-verbal
It's really funny,#Statement-opinion
it's very deceiving, you know, 'cause if they see it with their eyes they go, uh, I don't like want that,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
you know,#Other
and yet if they don't ever see it, th-, then it's like, oh this tastes okay, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Anyway.#Uninterpretable
We had,#Statement-non-opinion
my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash.#Statement-non-opinion
Everybody would say we don't like squash, we won't eat squash,#Statement-non-opinion
so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
and then we'd go, oh, this is really good.#Statement-non-opinion

Okay, uh,#Other
have you, did you, have you grown up in Dallas, Stephanie?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, no#No answers
I've only been here for the last ten years, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, where are you from?#Wh-Question
I grew up most of my childhood in Germany.#Statement-non-opinion
In Germany.#Repeat-phrase
Uh, and,#Uninterpretable
Well,#Uninterpretable
we, we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance.#Statement-non-opinion
Now there's a place I'd like to visit#Statement-non-opinion
So we, we travelled all over Europe.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's neat.#Appreciation
When I was, when I was very young. Unfortunately, a, a little bit too young to really appreciate.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I was grade school age. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
My hus-, my husband had a bicycle tour of Europe, or took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war#Statement-non-opinion
and so we've seen lots of pictures of the, of the beautiful,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
spots and,#Other
That,#Statement-non-opinion
areas,#Other
y-,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that would be a, to me, a really nice vacation#Other
Yeah.#Other
because I'm, I'm not in physical shape for something like that, but, uh, I, I sure would work on it#Other
.#Non-verbal
if I had an opportunity like that.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's neat, neat#Appreciation
What kind of vacations do you like?#Open-Question
Uh, well my husband and I are scuba divers.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh. H-,#Response Acknowledgement
So, we both like to go to dive resorts.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, we went to Hawaii on our honeymoon,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we dove there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, but, we, we did about six dives while we were there.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, we were originally planning on going to Cayman,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, last year#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, but, we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip.#Statement-non-opinion
We had to have, like, eleven people for,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this package, uh, deal.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and we couldn't get enough people together, uh, to go,#Statement-non-opinion
so it ended up falling a-, falling through.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We were going to get a really good price.#Statement-non-opinion
When, when our children were younger, we enjoyed, we lived up in, uh, New York,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or New Jersey and, and used to like, uh, traveling into upstate New York and camping#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and, that sort of thing,#Statement-non-opinion
but we've never really, uh, did any diving or anything.#Statement-non-opinion
Little bit of s-, of, uh, uh, oh,#Statement-non-opinion
Snorkeling?#Collaborative Completion
s-, water skiing.#Other
Oh, really.#Response Acknowledgement
But, not much of, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of anything else.#Other
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, my husband and I both like water,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so any, any vacation that we go on is usually,#Statement-non-opinion
It's got to be the water.#Collaborative Completion
involves, close to the ocean,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or, or something like that.#Other
When, when we were in Jersey, we used to go down to the Jersey beach a lot, and really enjoyed that a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
It's really, they had,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we,#Statement-non-opinion
a really nice beach areas there.#Other
After we moved away from Germany, we moved to New Hampshire.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I lived there for seven years.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
That's a really pretty area, too.#Appreciation
and I really enjoyed that because, you know, the mountains were real close,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we like the, we like the white mountains#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, unfortunately, I didn't really get to go skiing much while I was there.#Other
I went skiing once.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we loved the, we loved the, the New Jersey area, too, because the the lakes were really pretty close, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
you could,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and, and just really,#Other
and then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail,#Statement-non-opinion
we did quite a bit of hiking,#Statement-non-opinion
which is kind of fun.#Statement-opinion
Are you a, you a hiker, or not?#Or-Clause
Uh,#Hold before answer/agreement
Not so much, huh?#Yes-No-Question
Not, not really so much.#Negative non-no answers
If, if, if there was some place that, that we went to where there was hiking involved, I, I would be you know, happy to go hiking,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but we, we never have really planned a vacation around, uh, places to go hiking.#Statement-non-opinion
So your, your next, your plans are try to find someplace to s-, scuba dive.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Our next vacation will, will be scuba diving,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sure.#Statement-non-opinion
You have any children?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
not yet.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
then that's probably one of the reasons our,#Uninterpretable
we had little children all the time,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so some of the things are not as, quite as, uh, adaptable.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's a, it's a little more, difficult planning a vacation,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Agree/Accept
when you have, have children.#Other
You have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy, too,#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, I think, wha-,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and diving is something that,#Statement-opinion
especially for small children, uh,#Statement-opinion
I think the, the minimum age for diving is,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is probably, legal anyway, would be probably about sixteen.#Other
Eleven or twelve, I would think, probably#Statement-non-opinion
but, maybe fifteen even.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know that, uh, uh, one of, one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, we go wherever somebody is,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that we haven't seen for a while#Other
So that, that's kind of,#Uninterpretable
uh, we just came back from, uh, uh, Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
from, uh, with his Master's Degree in social work#Other
and so that was fun,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and the summer we have a, we have a, a reunion in, in Salt Lake area up by Park Cities.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
Where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of, of a rather large reunion group that, uh, as we can get together#Other
so,#Uninterpretable
That, that sounds like a lot of fun.#Appreciation
Ye-,#Uninterpretable
Our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that, too,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that there were several hundred, uh, people#Statement-non-opinion
and they all kind of met at a central place.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I didn't go,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, but it would have been nice. It would have been a nice vacation.#Statement-non-opinion
We, we've tra-, we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe, you know, like a,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a small camper.#Other
We've, we've travelled in a big one.#Statement-non-opinion
I hate them because they're hard to jockey around, you know,#Statement-opinion
but maybe a pickup with the back on,#Uninterpretable
Some-, or something like, uh, what's the, like the Volkswagen Vanagon.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've heard is really nice.#Other
So you could kind of sleep in it sometimes,#Statement-opinion
but you wouldn't want to do it all the time.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, we have enough friends here and there,#Statement-non-opinion
I would just love to just drive through the United States and stop and see people I know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and visit for a day and then go on and, you know.#Other
My dad has been talking for years about, uh, getting a fifth wheel#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and just picking up,#Other
he's retired#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, he's in his sixties,#Statement-non-opinion
and he, uh, would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and just, you know, not,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
be settled anywhere,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think,#Statement-opinion
just see, see the rest of the country.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that would real,#Other
and I would like to maybe not take great long trips, but, but have your home base, where your home is#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then just travel out for, like, maybe, oh, a month, maybe go,#Other
He, he does that quite a bit.#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Uninterpretable
He, he hasn't lately, though, uh, because he's been ill,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, he'll say, this is my itinerary.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm going here, here and here#Quotation
and I'll be back in about two months#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There are a lot of neat, neat places to visit in America,#Statement-opinion
that's for sure.#Appreciation
We've, I haven't been much to the south,#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't been in, in Georgia or Florida or Mississippi or Alabama.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess that's, those are the only states I have not visited.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, up the coast, uh, at, uh, uh, in Maryland and around there, where the, where the early history is, there's some#Statement-non-opinion
Johnstown and, uh, in s-, in that area is just really neat,#Statement-opinion
interesting things to#Statement-opinion
so, you know.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so,#Uninterpretable
Have you been a, to a lot of the different historical sites?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
we took a trip, uh, around to the, uh, Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I believe it was.#Agree/Accept
Uh, had about three kids then I think,#Statement-non-opinion
but that was a really fun, interesting trip.#Statement-non-opinion
I we, we read Bruce book before we went, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and, so we were ready to look up the places we read about.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I#Statement-non-opinion
It was really interesting.#Statement-non-opinion
I think right, right now while my husband and I don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and,#Other
Yeah.#Other
and adventurous types of things,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then when we-, eventually, when we have kids,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now, his, his folks did a lot of traveling across country.#Statement-non-opinion
You know they went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, now, camping is fun with kids.#Statement-opinion
If you're,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
once they get a little bigger, not teeny tiny ones,#Statement-opinion
but, even, even some little ones do pretty good#Statement-opinion
but,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but when they get a little bigger so they can help,#Other
that, that's a fun way to to, uh, cut costs#Statement-opinion
and it's enjoyable, too.#Statement-opinion
Very restful.#Statement-opinion
I mean I find,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I do enjoy camping.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I find the outdoors very relaxing and, you know, kind of a change.#Statement-opinion
As long as I have a shower nearby, I'm fine#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And electricity.#Other
Well, I'm with you.#Appreciation
I need my creature comforts, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, it was great to talk to you.#Conventional-closing
It was nice talking to you, too, Beth.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
see you later.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

I don't know if you feel the same#Declarative Yes-No-Question
but, uh, when it comes to telling kids that they have to do, uh, two or three years of service into some kind of community, I don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that and say, you know, you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen#Statement-opinion
or, you know, in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I, as far as a high school course, I could see it as, uh, maybe a social, uh, sociology course#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program#Other
and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to me, that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter, post high school, of community service, I, I'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do.#Statement-opinion
Um. Well, that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as opposed to, uh, mandatory.#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
I kind of agree with that.#Agree/Accept
Uh, I don't think,#Uninterpretable
you know, i-, it, they should have, they should have the same rights as anyone else#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It shouldn't be, uh, anything shouldn't be mandatory, other than, I guess, like, uh, when you come to paying taxes or something like that.#Statement-opinion
Uh, or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, people be more eager to do it.#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And doing it for a purpose that they want.#Statement-opinion
The other thing is this,#Statement-opinion
I have thought about this on many times when you get these, uh, young troubled teenagers that, uh, don't have like the perspective of, uh, uh, of the community, a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems#Statement-opinion
but there are other people out in the community that may have problems.#Statement-opinion
Then I can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing.#Statement-opinion
You have to do so much as far as in#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
community service now.#Other
If they were, you know, th-, abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or if, uh, they destroyed some property around the, uh, area, then they would have to do, uh, to restore it and perhaps, uh, work, uh, for the community to beautify it or whatever#Statement-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I could see that working in you know, cases where it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever.#Other
And that's, I think they have done that#Statement-non-opinion
and judges have said well, you know, this is what you're going to get for a, you know, a misd-, misdemeanor or something,#Statement-non-opinion
you may end up having to do some kind of community service#Quotation
so I could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled,#Statement-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Uh, that's a good idea.#Appreciation
Uh, I think they should have more programs like that.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think, uh, us being taxpayers, we pay for, uh, people that's in jail or#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in trouble anyway.#Other
Sure.#Agree/Accept
We sure do.#Agree/Accept
So they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I agree wholeheartedly.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Repeat-phrase
But, uh, the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff going on, uh#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because like you say, is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so why have someone in year-, jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor.#Rhetorical-Questions
And sometimes, you know, putting them in jail doesn't really help#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because there's nothing in there that would reb-, rehabilitate re-,#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
rehabilitate#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
rehabilitate them#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then when they get out, they,#Statement-opinion
because they have this stigmatism of being in jail.#Statement-opinion
And there's a lot of anger, sure. You know, especially if they haven't went through treatment#Statement-opinion
and they dealt with other people in the, uh, system of prisons which, uh, you, you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever.#Statement-opinion
I would say the crimes would probably be, you know,#Statement-opinion
if you went in for a certain crime, there might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have,#Statement-opinion
so you're dealing with people, uh, that may, uh, be an influence later on#Statement-opinion
and, uh, an issue of anger would be is that I went to prison for a year or two#Statement-opinion
but I didn't get any rehabilitation#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or, uh, you know. But then again, those that have physically assaulted somebody, uh, that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the community if they're of a violent sort and to say#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

think about this?#Other
Uh, do you have children in school?#Yes-No-Question
I do.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh, I have two that are, uh, now just about ready to graduate from college#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I also have two that are just entering school.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, *#Uninterpretable
So you see a big difference then in before and#Yes-No-Question
Uh, well *#Other
now do you#Other
or,#Uninterpretable
I think they're just pushing them mu-, entirely to fast.#Other
A lot of testing?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade.#Other answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think that's such a long day for a kindergartner.#Statement-opinion
I do too,#Agree/Accept
I, oh, I think that's awful.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, I have a preschooler.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten#Statement-non-opinion
and I thought well how mature do you have to be#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
What's the new criteria, huh.#Rhetorical-Questions
And, uh, there is a,#Uninterpretable
do you have the standardized testing now?#Yes-No-Question
We have all kinds of testing#Affirmative non-yes answers
and it's over and over.#Statement-non-opinion
It's I T B S or, and, uh, just everything, everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they test, test, test.#Statement-non-opinion
I live in Plano actually#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't know if you've heard of Plano#Declarative Yes-No-Question
but#Statement-non-opinion
No.#No answers
it's a very transient community.#Other
A lot of people from everywhere,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just north of Dallas#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's grown in leaps and bounds.#Statement-non-opinion
I, we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And most of them from other places.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, J C Penney's come down from New York and, of course, T I and Xerox from Rochester#Statement-non-opinion
and we just,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
have lots of people from everywhere.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Lots of industry coming in,#Other
.#Non-verbal
and it's a very wealthy community.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, not that I am#Statement-non-opinion
but other people seem,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to be#Other
and I would love to know why#Uninterpretable
but I mean they do.#Statement-non-opinion
They have,#Uninterpretable
you would like to know what they're doing right#Summarize/reformulate
I, I would,#Agree/Accept
I really would.#Agree/Accept
I mean, they just have beautiful, beautiful homes#Statement-non-opinion
and they have everything.#Statement-non-opinion
The kids only wear name brand things to school#Statement-non-opinion
and it's one of these things,#Statement-opinion
Oh me.#Appreciation
Well that makes it hard for you, doesn't it.#Yes-No-Question
Well it does, you know.#Affirmative non-yes answers
It really does because I'm a single mom and I have a thirteen year old now#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, me.#Appreciation
uh, you know, it does.#Other
.#Non-verbal
I mean, we do it to a point#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, not to where she feels different,#Other
but#Statement-non-opinion
It's hard to explain to them why you can't.#Summarize/reformulate
some of them are very rich#Other
and so, uh, we just kind of have,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
everything here#Other
and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so I don't know how much of it,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
is us and how much of it is Texas#Other
but the kids are expected to excel in,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
everything.#Other
Oh, dear.#Appreciation
And it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first#Statement-opinion
and they're#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
expected to be.#Other
You know, their parents expect it,#Statement-opinion
the teachers expect it,#Statement-opinion
Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system#Statement-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and if you read national surveys, they're far from it.#Statement-non-opinion
And so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests.#Statement-opinion
How about the kids.#Open-Question
How are they coping with it?#Wh-Question
Well, not very well.#Statement-non-opinion
They bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and eat right in the morning before,#Other
.#Other
tests.#Other
I mean they make a big deal.#Statement-opinion
To me, the paper should just be put on the desk that day#Statement-opinion
and say just do this.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, I just feel they do better that way.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Rather than#Summarize/reformulate
And,#Uninterpretable
anticipating.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and I have older children too that now are out of high school#Statement-non-opinion
and they've always done this here.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it's always been the same#Statement-opinion
but it is, it's getting worse and worse,#Statement-opinion
is more pressure for everything. *#Statement-opinion
And I just think it's really awful#Statement-opinion
and I, I'm with you on that.#Agree/Accept
You don't hear too many people say this,#Other
but I think it's a very long day.#Statement-opinion
Oh, it is.#Appreciation
And my feeling is that, you know, you're only a kid once, and you don't want to#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
spend your whole life in school.#Other
My son said that, came home#Statement-non-opinion
and he said, he said Mom, all we do is work.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We hardly ever play#Quotation
and,#Uninterpretable
And I don't think that's right.#Statement-opinion
I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system.#Statement-opinion
Oh, likewise.#Agree/Accept
I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons, gymnastics, piano.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
I would like to see those things included in our school system#Statement-opinion
Wouldn't that be great.#Appreciation
because I think we should have well-rounded kids#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
not just book smart kids.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
And so I just find this a real problem.#Statement-opinion
I think if they're going to be there all day, they should find time.#Statement-opinion
One of my daughters, once, was out of school with Mono in her junior year I think it was.#Statement-non-opinion
And she had a home teacher for like four hours a week#Statement-non-opinion
and when she went back in six weeks, she was ahead.#Statement-non-opinion
So what#Rhetorical-Questions
Is that right?#Backchannel in question form
does that tell you?#Other
It tells you there's a whole#Statement-opinion
Oh, my gosh.#Appreciation
lot of wasted time.#Other
Oh, my gosh.#Appreciation
And they could be using this time better.#Statement-opinion
Well, for example, in my son's kindergarten. They're really finished at lunch time.#Statement-non-opinion
After lunch, they have some, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch,#Hold before answer/agreement
and then they have naps or rest period.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I think either send them home or do something#Statement-non-opinion
That's a very long day for kindergartners.#Appreciation
a little more interesting.#Other
I agree.#Agree/Accept
But I think that working parents have kind of demanded this.#Statement-opinion
I wouldn't be surprised.#Appreciation
You know, because they don't, they don't want to send them to daycare.#Statement-opinion
I doubt if they would say it was too long#Statement-opinion
That's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day#Statement-opinion
Uh, do you have the before school care,#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
at your school and the after school care?#Other
We have them at one school like,#Affirmative non-yes answers

I guess, um, I'm going to school while I'm working at T I,#Statement-non-opinion
so there's not a whole a lot of time that I've got, uh, for hobbies it seems like lately.#Statement-non-opinion
But one of the things that I do when I've got some spare time is I do some woodworking.#Statement-non-opinion
And that, oh, I guess, ranges anywhere from, uh, carpentry work to, um, um, some types of furniture and, um, oh, I don't know what you would call them, knickknacks, I guess, stuff you hang on the wall to put a mirror on#Statement-non-opinion
and I made some, um, candle sconces that you hang on the ...#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have quite a few of those that my uncle made.#Statement-non-opinion
There's something about working with wood that, that I enjoy, that,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
As you know, I think it's more like the mess you make, isn't it?#Statement-opinion
You don't have to worry about cleaning it up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
because it's, it's out there.#Statement-non-opinion
You know I don't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when I track in saw dust,#Statement-non-opinion
and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that,#Statement-non-opinion
but then, I get the opportunity to vacuum,#Statement-non-opinion
so I guess I get some of both.#Statement-non-opinion
What are some of your things you like to do?#Wh-Question
Well, when I have time I do like to sew,#Statement-non-opinion
um, I had been doing a lot of crocheting.#Statement-non-opinion
I make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My mother was real heavy into crafts,#Statement-non-opinion
and I would help her with whatever she happened to be doing,#Statement-non-opinion
and then, she would go to these, uh, arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, a lot of times I'd help her with that.#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately#Statement-non-opinion
we've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's a good time for gardening.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's been beautiful this last week#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
I could do with a little less wind,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think the, the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you find you do most of your, your, uh, crocheting or your knit work around Christmas time?#Yes-No-Question
I usually start in the fall.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And my husband says I do it, you know, make afghans so I can keep my lap warm.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's kind of what my wife says.#Statement-non-opinion
She enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something to cover her, her legs and feet with while she is working on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know it seems like, she,#Statement-non-opinion
I think she made three this year one for, uh, my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters.#Statement-non-opinion
So, those things they take some time to make.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I found one that's real easy,#Statement-non-opinion
it's, it's, um, um, um,#Uninterpretable
shoot, I can't even remember the name of it now,#Statement-non-opinion
but you make it in strips.#Statement-non-opinion
And it's real easy to do,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's just that it doesn't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that#Statement-non-opinion
but it's,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's kind of like quilting.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think tha-,#Uninterpretable
Mile a Minute.#Statement-non-opinion
That's the name of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Mile a Minute.#Repeat-phrase
Mile a Minute.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I'm not sure what she does#Statement-non-opinion
I, I,#Uninterpretable
first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across, you know, back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of, of afghan.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess that is your standard knitting, isn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah.#Yes answers
Usually single crochet would, is, is always starts it off.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I know,#Statement-non-opinion
If we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other, don't worry about it.#Action-directive
We have a, a very small phone company down here.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
And my husband says that's called rinky-dink#Statement-non-opinion
Instead of call waiting or call anything else.#Summarize/reformulate
No,#Reject
no.#Reject
.#Non-verbal
We can't have that down here.#Statement-non-opinion
We get disconnected all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I guess that's, that's one way to end a conversation.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well, it gets a little aggravating.#Statement-non-opinion
I've got kids all over the United States#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, you know, sometimes they get disconnected when I'm talking to them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What,#Uninterpretable
have you started your garden yet?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
We planted, um, potatoes and onions and bell peppers.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, boy.#Appreciation
Uh, what else did I get in there,#Self-talk
and jalapeno peppers.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Appreciation
always got to have those.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think I had four, uh, jalapeno plants last year.#Statement-non-opinion
I think one of them died,#Statement-non-opinion
but I, I've got, s-, I've put them, I chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because I, there is no way that I can eat all of those#Statement-non-opinion
nobody else in the family likes them,#Statement-non-opinion
but always got to the keep those planted.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
oh, my husband doesn't like them either,#Statement-non-opinion
but I can always give them away.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's kind of the way I am, um.#Statement-non-opinion
Besides they're fun to grow.#Statement-opinion
I planted, uh, zucchini last year.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I planted four hills of them.#Statement-non-opinion
I think I had three or four seeds in each one of them,#Statement-non-opinion
and those things just flat took over.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, it wasn't until late, I guess in the summer,#Statement-non-opinion
maybe it was because it was too dry,#Statement-non-opinion
they finally started making zucchini,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm not sure when a good time to plant those is, if they should be planted early or later.#Statement-non-opinion
It seems like all I got was,#Statement-non-opinion
Supposedly after the soil warms up.#Statement-non-opinion
I would think so, um,#Agree/Accept
seems like these all, they all went to, uh, to leaf,#Statement-non-opinion
and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I don't know if I,#Statement-non-opinion
Mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Other
but I don't, I hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I doubt if zucchini is in there.#Statement-non-opinion
It may not be,#Maybe/Accept-part
it may not be.#Maybe/Accept-part
Probably the same time the, the other squash is though.#Statement-opinion
You think they're later in the year?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Uh.#Uninterpretable
About the same time that you plant okra because it's supposed to be warm.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's true.#Agree/Accept
Most of the okra that is growing around higher is, is, uh, later okra.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well that's about, um,#Statement-non-opinion
We decided this year,#Statement-non-opinion
Go ahead.#Action-directive
I'm sorry,#Apology
go ahead.#Action-directive
Well, I was just going to say, it's a little over six or seven minutes.#Statement-non-opinion
So whenever you feel comfortable about concluding, well, I'm,#Action-directive
that would be fine.#Action-directive
Oh, just any time.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, all right.#Agree/Accept
I guess we'll call this one quits#Statement-non-opinion
an, and thanks for participating.#Thanking
All right.#Agree/Accept
Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.#Conventional-closing
All right,#Conventional-closing
have a good time.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing

I just pressed my, uh.#Statement-non-opinion
We're supposed to talk about recent political developments.#Statement-non-opinion
I got one that's interesting, not too, not too controversial,#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
you know, not,#Uninterpretable
doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I do get somewhat of a kick out of,#Statement-non-opinion
because Schwartzkopf, or the other generals, who I admire, how everyone wants to make, get them in politics.#Statement-opinion
I think#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's kind of an interesting recent thing, that I could think of recently that, uh,#Other
I was wondering what you thought about that#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
making the general, uh, getting a general into politics.#Other
They want him because he's popular, not because he can do the job.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Well, I've, I've been thinking about it,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, uh, I kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero,#Statement-non-opinion
those,#Uninterpretable
we're looking for a hero.#Statement-opinion
Well, TIME magazine was saying that in essence the general's staff was comparing to corporate presidents,#Statement-non-opinion
and they said in general, generals are more familiar with training, that they believe in training more.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They are much more educated than the average corporate president,#Statement-non-opinion
and so they really were very positive on a general's staff person having a, a very much better education than the average, uh, corporate president.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I thought well, maybe.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I think they probably have a better education than the average congressman.#Statement-opinion
Well, that, too,#Agree/Accept
that, too.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, you know, they talk about the Army#Statement-non-opinion
and because of the war#Statement-non-opinion
and why did we win, and all that,#Statement-non-opinion
and they talked about how the training was so important.#Statement-non-opinion
And that's so important in industry,#Statement-non-opinion
so, you know, they're liable to be right. That generals, generals in the service,#Statement-opinion
and Schwartzkopf, uh, you know, might make a good, uh, politician, whether it be Governor or whatever, you know.#Statement-opinion
He, he, you know, we know he's a good leader,#Statement-opinion
we know he's a good organizer.#Statement-opinion
The question is, you know, can he be the man who's ultimately responsible.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, like what he said is, you know, a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about, you know, people asking why are you doing this, why are you doing that.#Statement-non-opinion
He says, I'm following the orders of my president.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not the one who writes the orders.#Quotation
I'm just the one who follows them.#Quotation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs, you know,#Statement-opinion
everyone has a boss, of course.#Statement-opinion
You know, Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so he went to the President and said, okay, here's how I want to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
But he wasn't the one that decided Iraq needed to get out of Kuwait.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
that's true,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you, you pick one.#Action-directive
.#Non-verbal
I just thought of that one when, when they brought up about politics.#Statement-non-opinion
That was, uh, pretty easy#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you don't have to pick Democratic or Republican,#Action-directive
you can pick anything you want,#Action-directive
go ahead.#Action-directive
Well, the thing that I'm wondering about is how we get a new congress.#Statement-non-opinion
How do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long,#Rhetorical-Questions
how do we get them to not get reelected over and over again.#Rhetorical-Questions
Well, I have an easy answer for that, oh, I wish they would do it, is that limit it, you know, to eight or ten years max.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, whether that's two#Statement-opinion
I th-,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
five year terms or whatever.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
That may be our only answer,#Statement-opinion
but I don't really like it.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't like the fact that the President is limited in the number of terms he can serve.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you know, you're not.#Reject
I think if the President, be him Republican or Democrat,#Statement-non-opinion
I think if the President can prove that he's popular, you know, that he can do the job#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want.#Other
I think the reason why we've got these guys in Congress is because of the fund raising rules.#Statement-opinion
I mean, how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year, did they get after they were elected, just, you know, just after they were elected two years ago.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Basically the people,#Statement-opinion
as soon as they get elected, the people dump all kinds of money on them and say, Yeah, yeah, you're my friend,#Statement-opinion
you're my friend,#Quotation
and two years later he remembers that.#Statement-opinion
And what they done is they've bought this congressman for two years.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know,#Hedge
I do like the limitation of the President,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think there is a needed change.#Statement-opinion
I think the same thing should happen for Congress.#Statement-opinion
I, I'd lik-, you know,#Uninterpretable
that would be my answer of an#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well.#Uninterpretable
easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years.#Other
My God, it's ridiculous, you know.#Statement-opinion
That's, that's the easy way.#Statement-opinion
I think the harder way out would be to make the guys that are in there and the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground#Statement-opinion
We had.#Uninterpretable
That's what the financing rules and the, uh, the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff.#Statement-opinion
I think voting is, is a prob-, I think I had one of the subject about voting, and, uh, voting apathy, or something like that,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think that, uh, the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time.#Statement-opinion
I can't believe that a country our big votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning til seven o'clock at night, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Of course they have absentee which is getting to be more, a lot easier,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I vote as often on absentee as I can because it's so easy now.#Statement-non-opinion
But, I think, gee whiz, you could make it a couple days.#Statement-opinion
It's just, if you really want the majority of the people to vote#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then give them a couple of days.#Other
Well, I think a lot more people could vote if they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, like, you know, the, the recent election about how the Dallas City Council should be made up, that election last December.#Statement-opinion
Are you in Dallas?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I'm in Dallas city limit.#Statement-non-opinion
Boy, I, I, I live in Arlington.#Statement-non-opinion
I am so happy not to be part of Dallas#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when I see those folks there.#Other
It's an ugly mess.#Statement-opinion
I mean, I don't know if you like the mayor,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think your mayor,#Statement-opinion
the city council,#Statement-opinion
the,#Uninterpretable
what is the woman's name whose, us, not the mayor but the, *#Wh-Question
The manager.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
the city manager.#Statement-non-opinion
All of them need to be thrown out.#Statement-opinion
I mean, they're just awful, just awful.#Statement-opinion
Well, what get's me is this thing, it went down to defeat last December by how many votes, by just a few hundred votes.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
And if it, if it had passed,#Statement-opinion
if these people had gotten out the vote, it would have passed#Statement-opinion
and there'd be no more argument.#Statement-opinion
But they're still fighting about it because of the#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
way the election went last December.#Other
It's so awful that politicians always spent consulting money. That we put them in office and then they go out and spend a couple hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy consultants,#Statement-opinion
and then they don't even do that recommendation, you know.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in.#Statement-opinion
But, but this is for, supposedly to benefit the minorities,#Statement-non-opinion
and all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote#Statement-opinion
Well you're right there.#Agree/Accept
and they would have had their way.#Statement-opinion
You're right there.#Agree/Accept
Uh, uh, people are,#Uninterpretable
uh, uh, politics, uh,#Uninterpretable
the voting is still not as much as you think in all kinds of issues really.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's pretty sad.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Statement-opinion
Uh, hopefully people will get more involved.#Statement-non-opinion
My, my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
but those are the ones that are complaining, I, I think, a lot.#Statement-opinion
I see it here at T I.#Statement-non-opinion
The guys that don't take any interest in, and, and constantly on the negative of everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh,#Backchannel in question form
And, and you ask them why they don't vote,#Statement-non-opinion
they say well they don't want their name on the, uh, jury duty list.#Statement-non-opinion
Is that right? Ooh.#Other
That, that's where they get the jury duty list, is from the voter registration.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
you're right,#Agree/Accept
you're right.#Agree/Accept
I think they could do more about, uh, voting.#Statement-opinion
I think they could.#Statement-opinion
What are the issues?#Wh-Question
I, I'm a Democrat,#Statement-non-opinion
I want to just say that I'm so sad that there isn't a strong Democrat.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't even know,#Hedge
I could go out and debate George Bush better than I see any Democrat doing it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, I mean, at least I'd like to see compe-,#Statement-non-opinion
because I like competition, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead,#Statement-opinion
I'm so disgusted with the Democratic party,#Statement-non-opinion
I can not believe it, you know. *#Statement-non-opinion
In Presidential races that's about what they've done,#Statement-opinion
but they've got a pretty good lock on Congress and#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a lot of local things.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I still think in the last ten years,#Statement-opinion
you know, of course that's not a recent event,#Statement-non-opinion
that's only my opinion,#Hedge
I guess I really shouldn't talk about that.#Hedge
But, I don't know whether they're recent events.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess they we-, on this, uh, speech thing, they want us to use a variety of words.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
How many times have you called, by the way?#Yes-No-Question
Actually, I haven't made any calls,#Statement-non-opinion
but I received about a dozen.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really, I, I, I,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think, yeah, I have to make these,#Statement-non-opinion
but I get distracted and get to do something else,#Statement-non-opinion
and all of a sudden my phone rings,#Statement-non-opinion
and go, Well, what the heck, we'll talk for a while.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've already got twelve cards.#Statement-non-opinion
You get any cards in the mail?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
we got a whole bunch.#Statement-non-opinion
I can't remember how many.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
I'm amazed by,#Statement-non-opinion
of course, we're not talking about politics,#Statement-non-opinion
but I am amazed by,#Statement-non-opinion
people say they got thirty.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I wonder why you need thirty renditions of the persons voice,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm not in voice synthesis.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But I'd sure like to see a summary of it.#Statement-non-opinion
We'll get to politics, I'm sorry#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I think we've used up as much time as we're supposed to anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
We're supposed to do five minutes,#Statement-non-opinion
and that was three minutes ago.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Hey, well thanks for the call.#Thanking
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay, um,#Other
I don't know about you#Statement-non-opinion
but where I am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work#Statement-non-opinion
and it varies like every day. I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
It's pretty bad,#Statement-opinion
but it's true, you know,#Statement-opinion
they tend to try to be, you know, real lax#Statement-non-opinion
and supposedly the policy is like, you know, we, you know, we, hire these wonderful creative people#Statement-non-opinion
and we don't want to smush their creativity, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
We want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want.#Statement-non-opinion
And, you know, you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I'm kind of that way too.#Statement-non-opinion
I work in the legal department#Statement-non-opinion
and where we are now, what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day,#Statement-non-opinion
it always seems like I'm doing that#Statement-opinion
and I can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry, you know, boxes of documents around,#Statement-opinion
so, if I'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing, you know, odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents, I dress down.#Statement-non-opinion
But if we're going to have a meeting, where we're having the attorneys come in, or people from, uh, other party's attorneys and stuff, then I normally dress up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
and I'll wear a dress and hose and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, we're kind of that way too.#Statement-non-opinion
I try to,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm the same way you are,#Statement-opinion
I kind of try to judge from day to day.#Statement-non-opinion
I know, you know, where I am we work a lot with the customers#Statement-non-opinion
and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, if I know that they're going to be there, you know, you, I try to really watch it and like you say, you know, really dress up#Other
and if I know they're not, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I've been doing a lot of reorganization, you know, the last couple of months the same way you are, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's just , it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
It is#Statement-opinion
and so,#Uninterpretable
As a matter of fact, I thought I had one funny story#Statement-non-opinion
when, uh, I was at T I the first year or so, we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes.#Statement-non-opinion
We had them in the warehouse,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Uninterpretable
and at that point, it, the warehouse was over across the road#Statement-non-opinion
and it wasn't air conditioned,#Statement-non-opinion
and, it, we were there like in the middle of the summer,#Statement-non-opinion
it's unair-conditioned,#Statement-non-opinion
it was dusty and dirty, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
there was like a fan at the very end of the row#Statement-non-opinion
and that was it.#Statement-non-opinion
And so, we didn't really know we weren't supposed to,#Statement-non-opinion
we thought T I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we wore shorts.#Statement-non-opinion
We didn't know that was a big no, no.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh no.#Appreciation
And the supervisor from another area came up to us#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, this area where record retention is, there's only a few people that work there,#Statement-non-opinion
and he, sho-, he knew who worked there,#Statement-non-opinion
he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there.#Statement-non-opinion
And he came up to us#Statement-non-opinion
and he just said, who's your supervisor.#Statement-non-opinion
Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor, and our supervisor's supervisor,#Statement-non-opinion
and it went up all the way to the head of facilities,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh no#Appreciation
complaining that we were wearing shorts.#Other
He didn't at, at least say to us, did you know you're not supposed to do that.#Statement-non-opinion
That could have alleviated a big problem.#Statement-opinion
We ended up getting called out on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how awful.#Appreciation
It sounds like Mister Power Hungry.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
You know, just yesterday, though, I saw a girl in the spine out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I don't care,#Statement-non-opinion
you can call them split skirts#Statement-non-opinion
and you can call them culottes all you want#Statement-non-opinion
but these were shorts.#Statement-opinion
That's all they were.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I don't care what else you call them, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
if they're below the knee, okay,#Statement-opinion
maybe you can call them split skirts.#Statement-opinion
If they're above the knee they turn into shorts, you know.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And these weren't even really full ones.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean they had a problem out here with it last summer, wearing these shorts that were, you know, the real wide full ones, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and becau-, these weren't even those.#Statement-non-opinion
These were like pretty short, black,#Statement-non-opinion
and they were very dressy,#Statement-non-opinion
the were black velvet shorts#Statement-non-opinion
and she had on black hose and black heels#Statement-non-opinion
and she looked very, very nice.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
But, you don't wear shorts to work.#Statement-opinion
You know, I mean, as far as I'm considered, she was in violation#Statement-opinion
and nobody says anything to them.#Statement-non-opinion
It's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
You know, if they just, you know,#Uninterpretable
the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an, cut off, you know, that no,#Statement-opinion
this is wear we're going to draw the line.#Quotation
This is shorts, you know.#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
so, it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going, well God, we have a pair of those at home too.#Statement-opinion
It sure would be cool and comfortable to wear, you know,#Quotation
but.#Uninterpretable
Well I've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they have said no#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then during the week you see these women, in the you know,#Statement-non-opinion
just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean I've never seen them do it without hose,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean they always have hose on,#Statement-non-opinion
but still, it's, they're shorts,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't care what you say,#Statement-non-opinion
they're shorts.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Well I think T I's dress code is pretty lax considering everything, anyway, you know, uh.#Statement-opinion
I know, I didn't know that E D S has a very strict dress code,#Statement-non-opinion
I had a friend,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh do they really?#Yes-No-Question
Oh definitely.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I had a friend who worked there for a year or so#Statement-non-opinion
and they spell it out.#Statement-non-opinion
For men it's particular suits, uh, the pin stripe, and the particular colors of shirts and win-, wing tipped shoes.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my God.#Appreciation
Oh, it is definitely lined out.#Statement-non-opinion
Women are not allowed to wear slacks,#Statement-non-opinion
you wear coordinated suits.#Statement-non-opinion
I coul-, I couldn't afford to work there.#Statement-non-opinion
And, and a particular kind of shoe, you know, so high heel,#Statement-non-opinion
oh it is spelled out.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
When I was looking at her materials when she first started, you know, she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it told about the dress code#Statement-non-opinion
and it said, these are the color pastel shirts you may wear, or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and, hair just this way.#Statement-non-opinion
T I -s says no shorts and no halters#Statement-non-opinion
I know, that's it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and E D S is very particular about this, hair cuts,#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
I mean it was like you can't have, you know, such and such facial hair, no beards, you know, and just really detailed.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know that that would be a good environment to work in.#Statement-opinion
I mean, I see,#Uninterpretable
I, I am more,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know about anybody else,#Statement-non-opinion
and a lot of bosses may say I'm nuts,#Statement-non-opinion
but I am more productive when I'm in pants.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I, I am.#Statement-opinion
I work faster,#Statement-opinion
I get things done faster, than when I'm in a dress and heels, you know,#Statement-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
and it's weird#Statement-opinion
but I, it's I do, I can, I can get so much more done if I'm dressed comfortable, you know.#Statement-opinion
Well the, the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had, uh, another person coming from Washington, our outside counsel.#Statement-non-opinion
And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse#Statement-non-opinion
but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse, but the warehouse.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And she came with skirts, just like she'd be going into the office.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we'd try, we'd try to say, didn't you bring any pants or anything.#Statement-non-opinion
We're, we're out here in the warehouse, you know,#Quotation
you, you got your skid of, you know, that wooden pallet of boxes.#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you're going to have un-, unload you skid look at the documents in the, in the boxes and then repack your skid.#Quotation
And she#Statement-non-opinion
You can't do that in a skirt poor soul.#Summarize/reformulate
And she was so, she was so hot and miserable, you know, in the skirt.#Other
Oh yuck.#Appreciation
She finally tried to go buy, you know, a pair of pants#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, I mean it was just completely miserable for her.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's terrible,#Appreciation
that's terrible#Appreciation
gosh.#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
Well I don't know,#Hedge
I just figure, you know, yeah,#Statement-non-opinion
sometimes I worry about, you know, if I go in in pants,#Statement-non-opinion
and I never, I never ever, ever, ever go in in a pair of jeans, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
But I'll go in in pants.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean today I had on a pair of, you know, navy blue dress slacks and, and, uh, like a peach colored top and, you know, not cruddy, but not a dress either.#Statement-non-opinion
And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that would, will hold you back, you know, if you don't dress in, you know, your dress for success business suits everyday if, you know, if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, I don't know if they do or not.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I see a lot of the managers#Statement-non-opinion
and they're in jeans,#Statement-non-opinion
so, you know.#Uninterpretable
Some of our people in the legal department,#Statement-non-opinion
we have, um, assistants to the general counsel#Statement-non-opinion
and it's funny#Statement-opinion
because, there's one that always wears a suit.#Statement-non-opinion
A matter of fact, he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on, buttoned.#Statement-non-opinion
Really, wow.#Appreciation
And then there's another one who's, who's a little younger and a little more yuppish#Statement-non-opinion
and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and, you know, a shirt,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and sometimes he wears the jacket to it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes#Statement-non-opinion
and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt.#Statement-non-opinion
So that's just,#Uninterpretable
Isn't that funny.#Backchannel in question form
With the, you know, the little suspenders or something on#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Statement-non-opinion
That's great.#Appreciation
We've, we've kind of had a variety there#Other
but, I think a lot of times it's, it's mainly who they're going to meet with,#Statement-opinion
or they're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If they're just going to be meeting with T I -ers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the, they're engineers that they're talking too, they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed#Statement-non-opinion
and they're usually casual.#Statement-non-opinion
That's the way to do it. I mean that's the smart way to do it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It really is, because your making, you know,#Statement-opinion
if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down, if they come in, in, you know, a six hundred dollar three piece suit, it's going to make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable, you know,#Statement-opinion
or it would me, you know.#Hedge
It's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
look at this slick guy,#Action-directive
I wonder what kind of money does he make,#Statement-non-opinion
uh-huh#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
I can see it now.#Statement-non-opinion
Well it was good to talk to you.#Conventional-closing
It was really enjoyable.#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
this is, this is kind of a fun project.#Conventional-closing
It really is.#Agree/Accept
I've done some of the other speech programs,#Statement-non-opinion
but we've never got to talk to another person,#Statement-non-opinion
it was always just talking to the computer.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yuck,#Appreciation
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So this is a little different.#Statement-opinion
Well it's kind of enjoyable,#Statement-opinion
I'm really looking forward to it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well thanks a lot.#Thanking
Okay,#Other

by the time I get home I'm so tired it's hard to cook a full meal.#Other
I expect so.#Appreciation
Uh, well for a dinner party, I think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine.#Statement-non-opinion
That's, that's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party, mine is, is a, is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so Where did you get your recipe for it?#Wh-Question
Um, I guess mostly out of an international cookbook that I have.#Statement-non-opinion

Well mine actually came from the, um, Texas Instruments Cafeteria.#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
great.#Appreciation
And they, they put this one out#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it, uh, it's a, it's a red wine.#Statement-non-opinion

And, uh, I'm trying to think what else.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I roll it in bread crumbs and, uh, Parmesan cheese,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, then I rub it with a little bit, I rub the chicken with a little bit of oil,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and pour the wine sauce over it as, like the last twenty minutes,#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that it gets just enough flavor.#Other
Oh, so it kind of browns#Statement-non-opinion
and then you put wine over it.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
That sounds real good.#Appreciation
And, it's really easy too#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What do you use ?#Wh-Question
What do you serve with it?#Wh-Question

Uh, do you like angel food cake?#Yes-No-Question

Wow.#Appreciation
and I make a thickened blueberry sauce#Statement-non-opinion

What time should we be there?#Backchannel in question form
.#Non-verbal
That sounds wonderful#Appreciation
It is, it's great.#Statement-opinion
I love desserts,#Statement-non-opinion
but since there's only two of us,#Statement-non-opinion

I, I try to avoid making anything that, too fancy, that,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we'd like too much and eat too much#Other
I know, I know what you mean.#Statement-non-opinion
We don't eat desserts much any more.#Statement-non-opinion
But I, I guess one that, that I really like, that I haven't made in awhile,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, it's called a fruit pizza.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you take a, uh, sugar cookie, uh, recipe,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and spread it out on a pizza pan.#Other
So you make it like a pizza crust,#Statement-non-opinion
and then you, you bake that#Statement-non-opinion
and then you, um, take things like kiwi,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want#Other
and you mix that with, um, excuse me, you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice#Statement-non-opinion
and I can't remember what else is in it#Statement-non-opinion
and you make kind of a glaze,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then you layer your fresh fruit on that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, and pour that over it?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
That sounds great.#Appreciation
It is really good,#Statement-opinion
and it,#Statement-non-opinion

Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Especially with like the kiwi and the strawberries.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That would be pretty.#Statement-opinion

Plain?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Plain yogurt?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
If I,#Uninterpretable
just plain yogurt.#Affirmative non-yes answers
It gives it a little tang.#Statement-non-opinion
I'll bet that is really good.#Appreciation
It makes a great sandwich.#Statement-opinion
Man,#Appreciation
I'm going to have to think of that.#Statement-non-opinion
We're getting company tonight,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, are you#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian.#Statement-non-opinion

They'll eat fish?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
She'll eat fish.#Statement-non-opinion
And, I usually,#Uninterpretable
when they come down I'll grill those#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and brush on a little lemon butter sauce#Other
and, um, definitely go with, it will have to be a rice dish#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Huh-uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

I haven't either.#Statement-non-opinion
This edition is published by Bonanza Books.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's a big book#Appreciation
but it was not expensive.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, the ones that I've been, I've been wanting to get, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess you've seen the THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE WAYS TO COOK CHICKEN,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE WAYS TO COOK PASTA,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've been, I've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we do eat a lot of pasta.#Statement-non-opinion
We do too.#Other
Yeah#Agree/Accept
So, we, we just said the other night it wouldn't be too difficult to be, to do without red meat.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
I don't think it would.#Statement-opinion
You know, we don't have that much of it now.#Statement-non-opinion
As long as we have plenty of vegetables,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and lots of chicken.#Other
I stir fried some the other night though.#Statement-non-opinion
Some, uh, beef and broccoli strips,#Statement-non-opinion
it was good,#Statement-non-opinion
but it didn't have much beef in it#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've got a, I've got a Wok that we don't use near as often as we used to.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We used to stir fry a lot, especially, um, a lot of chicken and, and a lot of rice dishes.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it just takes the time to cut everything up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But usually if I'm, if I'm, if I take a day off or on the weekend especially, I try to cook,#Statement-non-opinion
Cook.#Collaborative Completion
real, real food.#Other
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And at least cook a couple of dishes ahead.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that we can have those to enjoy.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
One of my daughters sent me a COLORADO COOK BOOK, put out by the Junior League of Denver.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Have you ever seen any put out by Junior Leagues?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Cause, we have some,#Statement-non-opinion
they are great.#Statement-opinion
some local ones.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we have a share alike column in the paper,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where people, you know, write in and share recipes or write in and say I'm looking for this recipe,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's where I get a lot of my recipes.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They are good, usually good aren't they?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
And I got, I got a real good one from a doctor's office one time.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, is that right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what was that?#Wh-Question
It's, uh, it's a baked bean recipe.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you mix baked beans and Lima beans#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, let's see, I guess,#Statement-non-opinion
You buy the canned baked, canned baked beans?#Yes-No-Question

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup, you know,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and you just bake it.#Statement-non-opinion
And it's just, it's like a, a spicier baked bean dish.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that sounds#Appreciation
And, you can add hamburger if you want,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to give it a little more body.#Other
That sounds good.#Appreciation
So, I, I try to always keep my eyes open and because a lot of time you can find, find really good recipes where you wouldn't even think about it.#Statement-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I try to always keep a little notebook in my purse.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Jot them down, huh?#Statement-non-opinion
But, it's been,#Uninterpretable

Well, I think health care is real important, and dental coverage,#Statement-opinion
but I guess medical insurance is probably what I consider the second most important.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree on that.#Statement-non-opinion
And, you know, it seems pa-,#Statement-opinion
compared to what we, our salary is#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
versus what our health care is, our health care keeps increasing, increasing, increasing and not to the same rate as our pay#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
I know#Statement-opinion
no matter what you do about that, yeah, unless you're like a Senior V P or something which I am not#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Me either#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, um,#Uninterpretable
I don't know.#Hedge
And then when you interview for a job or something sometimes people, um, expect the benefits to take the place of a certain salary level.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, they'll say maybe we'll pay you X amount annually,#Statement-non-opinion
but then we, you know, ten percent to fifteen percent more are your benefits#Quotation
and if you're like,#Statement-opinion
are you married?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Um, like my husband works,#Statement-non-opinion
and I do#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't take some of,#Statement-non-opinion
I have certain things that I take,#Statement-non-opinion
and he has other things he takes.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I mean in that kind of situation it's really almost, redundant, you know,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know that some of the benefits, I would rather have, um, money.#Statement-non-opinion
Money instead.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
more money, actually, um,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or flex time or something that was a little more personal, you know.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I feel the same way, actually.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, we don't use any of T I -s benefits other than I, I buy bonds and, and, um, that's it#Statement-non-opinion
because,#Uninterpretable
You don't use, you don't use the medical insurance?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Not at all.#Negative non-no answers
You use your, your company's?#Declarative Yes-No-Question

He, he works for Bramalea Company,#Statement-non-opinion
and they pay one hundred percent.#Statement-non-opinion
Yo-,#Uninterpretable

Oh, you're kidding.#Appreciation
What's the name of that company ?#Wh-Question
Bramalea.#Statement-non-opinion
What do they do?#Wh-Question
It's a security company#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
Are they a big Company#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Yes answers
actually they're from Canada.#Statement-non-opinion
They're Canada based.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's, see, that's probably why cause Cana-, Canada has the, the, um, government run health care systems, social medicine.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you don't pay them. If you live there,#Statement-non-opinion
it's like Europe.#Statement-non-opinion
You don't pay a dime.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know?#Tag-Question
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's all taken care,#Statement-non-opinion
Sounds wonderful.#Appreciation
Yeah, but our prescriptions and everything, our visits to the doctor, our hospitalization,#Other
the only thing we pay for is if if something happened, an emergency, and we had to have an ambulance,#Statement-non-opinion
it's twenty-five dollars.#Statement-non-opinion

Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
You know, deducted for an H M O,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't work at T I.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband works at T I,#Statement-non-opinion

I work for E D S,#Other
but it's like, um,#Uninterpretable

Um, and we take my dental, my dental, his medical.#Other
And the medical is just, I mean, I think it's terrible, you know?#Statement-opinion

but they're, then they're getting ready to change it again for Aetna.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I don't know.#Hedge
I just don't think companies, um, they want you to feel responsible and don't abuse the medical system#Statement-opinion
and, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, T I just did the thing where, with the smoking premiums.#Other
We don't smoke,#Statement-non-opinion

Neither one of us do.#Statement-non-opinion
But then,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know, like a lady in my office said, she said her husband works for T I, too.#Other
And she said what about the people that are walking around,#Statement-non-opinion
and I hope,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't, you don't sound like you're in this category, but I mean#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for extremely obese people or something?*#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The kind of people that can't sit in the airline, airplane chair, you know?#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, who's going to croak first? The people that smoke or, you know?#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Seems like,#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
an unnecessary penalty,#Other
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean I'm not all for smoking at all,#Statement-non-opinion
but I just, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't how they can do it.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Carte blanket . *#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You can't charge more for a person who's on a flight#Summarize/reformulate
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just because they're larger. *#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Other
Or something.#Hedge
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
it's like,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
stupid,#Other
but,#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
That's why I'm not a boss, I guess#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean I don't know, um.#Hedge
What other, what other type of benefits do they have that, I mean, Canadian based companies .#Wh-Question
They have to be a little bit different than the American, um.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they are as far as their like pension plans ,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're vested a lot earlier.#Statement-non-opinion
I think at T I, it took five years.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
T I is at least,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
five years,#Other
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Five to seven.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they're vested after their first year.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
To-, totally vested.#Other
Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
And they have the four one K and the#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
usual benefits like that, uh.#Other
That's kind of nice.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
T I has that,#Statement-non-opinion
but that's a pretty standard thing anymore.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
You know, um, um, your husband's company probably matches more than T I, though.#Statement-opinion
No,#Reject
they match the same amount.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, they do ?#Signal-non-understanding
Yeah,#Yes answers
well, they match four percent which is the same,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, fifty percent or four percent. *#Other
That's still pretty good, though. I mean the fact that your vested that quickly#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the pension.#Other
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
I know, um,#Statement-non-opinion
E D S has eight years?#Statement-non-opinion
I think E D S has seven to, to eight years.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's like T I in that respect, you know?#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and, I mean, and I'm working for a company that's making money#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
E D S has a cash flow problem as they say but,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, not E D S, T I, um,#Other
but I, I don't know.#Hedge
I think everywhere they just need to sit down and hire some people, the grunts, as I call them, like myself#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to tell them,#Other
yeah.#Uninterpretable
I mean,#Hedge
It's,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Other
but if I were to rank them, I guess I would say next to income it's really just health benefits.#Statement-non-opinion
And then, um, for most people I know it would be day care#Statement-non-opinion
like T I has,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
no day care.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, and I know that's a big issue#Statement-non-opinion
because I, I belong to a women's forum group.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And some of the questions we're getting are, are on site day care and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That they consider a very serious benefit.#Statement-non-opinion
And I can't tell you anybody right now at T I that's, uh, considering that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I don't,#Uninterpretable
I would,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
think so,#Other
yeah#Uninterpretable
because,#Uninterpretable
They should be though.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they really should because they're big enough, um,#Statement-opinion
and the other thing I think is really good is that E D S is much better than T I at, I think, right now than, that we have day care, um, they, uh, the health, the health program#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like T I has Texans?#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it, I don't think it, that it's developed as much as it could be for the size company as T I.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean if you ever walked into E D S -s health, corner court health clubs on site#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you walk into Spring Creek, well, Spring Creek's better than the one on Dallas Parkway#Other
but,#Hedge
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
a lot better.#Statement-opinion
I mean, yeah.#Other
E D S is m-, is better than Spring Creek?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Ye-,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
Oh, it's really nice,#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Yes answers
Oh, man.#Appreciation
You know, instead of like six, um, treadmills, you've got like twenty.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And E D S can't even compare in size.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In terms of the number of employees.#Other
People,#Summarize/reformulate
yeah.#Uninterpretable
So I,#Hedge
.#Non-verbal
don't know.#Other
I guess it's just where they, um, and like E D S reimburses you for adoption.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And T I doesn't have anything like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, so I guess I, I wish the companies like T I and a lot of others were more progressive#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in that respect#Other
so,#Uninterpretable
That's good.#Appreciation
That's a, that's a fortunate benefit, you know, that they're so active#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for their employees.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and there's, I mean they have some strange things.#Statement-opinion
I mean they have very strange like dress codes#Statement-opinion
and, you know.#Uninterpretable
Um, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, you can't wear slacks at the corporate site and that kind of thing#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
unless you're in a, y-, you know,#Other
but it doesn't, there aren't manufacturing environments because of the type of company it is.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um,#Hedge
.#Non-verbal
I don't know.#Other
I, I guess I also wish that, uh, companies would look more at cost of living increases#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
instead of just merit reviews.#Other
Me, too.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
Me, too,#Agree/Accept
because, you know, with utilities and, and homes that are, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
price of homes have#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Agree/Accept
went up dr-, drastically.#Other
Like an average house is now a hundred and thirty thousand.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Other
exactly.#Agree/Accept
And that is unreal,#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
because we've got people out here that are just poverty level.#Other
But then we've got these million dollar homes#Statement-non-opinion
so#Rhetorical-Questions
I know.#Agree/Accept
you know, where do you find a happy medium?#Other
And how does your salary deal,#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with that?#Other
It's not.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I mean,#Statement-non-opinion
It's just not doing it.#Statement-opinion
I mean, I don't know how you and your husband are, too,#Other
but I mean we have friends that laugh at us#Statement-non-opinion
and we, I clip coupons.#Statement-non-opinion
And I said, hey, I'll probably do this even if I'm a millionaire which I won't,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
ever be.#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
But, I mean, it's like,#Statement-opinion
because you just can't,#Uninterpretable
I mean, it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, the car insurance is due#Other
That's true.#Agree/Accept
That is exactly where we are.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's so strange#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
I don't know what we're going to do about,#Statement-non-opinion
Common problem.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you,#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
want to rob a bank?#Other
No,#Other
I didn't say that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
really.#Appreciation
I didn't say that on this line.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I don't know.#Hedge
What else about corporate benefits?#Wh-Question
I can't think.#Statement-non-opinion
It's probably been too hot today for either of us to,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, kind of nice to talk to somebody in Dallas.#Statement-opinion
Usually people are all over the country.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I think Dallas, as far as, um, economic uncertainty, is better than what most of the country is.#Statement-opinion
This is true.#Agree/Accept
So wer-, somehow, we're better off than a lot of them.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that doesn't definitely make it any better.#Statement-opinion
It's,#Statement-opinion
No#Agree/Accept
just something you have to keep telling yourself, you know, that, um, that's what I want, that, uh, you know,#Other
people are lucky to have jobs,#Statement-opinion
and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
When you see people that don't have, um, anything but H M O -s or, you know, I mean really can't even afford to get in a job that costs,#Statement-non-opinion
like, we had a guy fixing our air conditioner.#Statement-non-opinion
And he said he didn't even make ten dollars an hour,#Statement-non-opinion
and he has three kids.#Statement-non-opinion
And I went, oh, you know, that has to be rough.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, but benefits,#Uninterpretable
I don't know.#Hedge
I guess, I guess one thing I'd like to see, too, and I, I don't know how T I is about this, but I'd like to see, um, employees rank and file be able to contribute more to their, um, the execution of their job.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Uninterpretable
Empowerment issues.#Summarize/reformulate
Right yeah,#Agree/Accept

that's a good word for it, um.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How is T I in that mode?#Wh-Question
Well, very well, um,#Statement-opinion
it's slow, though.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
At least they're making the effort to put it out there and make it available and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, cultural change within the management first.#Other
And now it's kind of filtering down to the peon level.#Statement-non-opinion

But, uh, I think they're really trying.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's going to take years, though.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean it's just, it's that mind-set,#Statement-opinion
All part of a good old boy network,#Summarize/reformulate
yeah.#Uninterpretable
has to change,#Other
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
E D S is, oh, they're better,#Statement-opinion
but they're a little bit too, um, stiff collared in terms of, you know, what you want to do.#Statement-opinion
They're pretty much put the, if that's where the widget goes, stick it in the hole, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They're kind of formula oriented.#Statement-non-opinion
Doesn't want to change.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and, and you can't really argue with them because they've always been successful#Statement-opinion
so,#Rhetorical-Questions
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, what can you tell them ?#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Really.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I guess that's what I know about benefits.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay. Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay ?#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Go-, good talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Good talking to you#Conventional-closing

Hello.#Conventional-opening
Hi, uh,#Conventional-opening
basically, I wear pants.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm a real pants person#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, like when I'm at home since,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'll say, I'm a homemaker since that's my basic thing, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I wear a pantsuit most of the time.#Statement-non-opinion
Not a pantsuit,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess pants and a shirt#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, in the summertime I wear cotton tops.#Statement-non-opinion
Cotton top shirts#Statement-non-opinion
and in the winter I wear, uh, like sweaters.#Statement-non-opinion
I like sweaters a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
And so I do that.#Statement-non-opinion
But when I go out for meetings uh, then I will wear sh-, either, uh, skirts or, uh, a dress#Statement-non-opinion
and I have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time,#Statement-non-opinion
but, that's basically what I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I think our tastes are fairly sim-, similar,#Statement-opinion
although I am I government worker, I do tend to,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, uh, a scientist.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that technically,#Uninterpretable
I suppose, I could get away with, with extremely casual clothes,#Statement-non-opinion
but, for the most port, part I don't.#Statement-non-opinion
I wear fairly respectable looking shoes#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a pantsuit of one sort or another#Other
and, uh, I guess dress it up with a, with a, a very nice black jacket when I have, have visitors or have to give talks.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that sounds nice.#Appreciation
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, it said the seasons,#Statement-non-opinion
do, do you change much through the season#Yes-No-Question
or,#Or-Clause
No,#No answers
actually I guess this summer I, I wore some fairly nice jeans#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, more than I have in previous seasons.#Other
But, uh, no,#No answers
I tend to, to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know whether they think by, you know, freezing them up overnight, then they can save electricity during the day or something.#Statement-opinion
Maybe.#Maybe/Accept-part
But#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, you know, you wear a heavy sweater in your office,#Other
.#Non-verbal
all summer.#Other
So, right,#Uninterpretable
uh, yeah,#Uninterpretable
I don't, I don't, I, you know, I'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I guess although in, as I recall the stereotype of, of secretaries was, you know, overdress, over kill, sort of#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in a s-, in a sense, the people I know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries.#Other
Although the fact that most of the ones I know are in the government and they're not meeting the public#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, I find it a little bit strange that their priorities would, would be to spend this money here#Other
You know,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, I suppose if you were a, a, more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake#Statement-opinion
Then may-,#Collaborative Completion
perhaps you would have to dress up.#Other
Uh, well, I don't have the resources to just go out and buy, buy, buy anyway#Statement-non-opinion
and so my don't change dramatically over the years.#Statement-non-opinion
If I need something new, I will go and buy it.#Statement-non-opinion
But, basically I'm a, a pretty much the same#Statement-non-opinion
in the summertime I wear the light cotton#Statement-non-opinion
and in the wintertime I change to the sweaters.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, so, it's not a whole lot of, of change for me either.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, especially when I go to the meetings and wear the dresses#Statement-non-opinion
I, I, I enjoy that,#Statement-non-opinion
but it just wouldn't be, uh, smart for me to do that in my home with my children.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I have to, uh, think about things like that, too.#Statement-non-opinion
I have given seminars before in, in creative writing and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Now, I don't know if they consider that a job.#Hedge
I don't really get paid for that, uh, often,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, when I do that then I, I think I become more businesslike.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, but it doesn't really change my clothing style.#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
I mean, you can look businesslike in, in a pant-, the same pant suit you would, you know#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
wear for other things.#Other
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
I'm, I'm really glad about that pant suits are popular because I'm allergic to many of the synthetics.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so I used to have a problem when, when I was working in a restaurant while I was in college#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and had to dress up, and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash.#Other
Oh, dear.#Appreciation
So,#Other
That's not helpful.#Appreciation
Right,#Other
right.#Agree/Accept
But otherwise, now, I'm, I guess we're both pretty practical#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I guess so#Hedge
Well, it's been great talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Have a great day.#Conventional-closing
Well, have a good day.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Well, got any problems on Mockingbird with crime#Yes-No-Question
or is that a crime free zone there?#Or-Clause
No,#No answers
I don't think there is any such thing,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
as a crime free zone any longer.#Other
I'm afraid you're right.#Statement-opinion
Uh, one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought, oh, well, something's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams#Statement-non-opinion
and the next thing I know there are policemen all around my house.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my.#Appreciation
And they had stopped a, uh, b-, a stolen car#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, boy.#Appreciation
and caught one of the men in the hedge#Other
and then the other one was on the roof in the back.#Statement-non-opinion
By your house?#Yes-No-Question
B-, on my house#Dispreferred answers
Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
Aye, aye, aye#Appreciation
So I'm very much aware of, uh, crime in the cities and the, and the concern about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my.#Other
That's, that's got to be a frightening way to#Statement-opinion
It was.#Statement-non-opinion
spend an evening.#Other
I, uh, I kept hearing noises#Statement-non-opinion
and so I, I knew that I was not going to sleep until I got up and went out and checked the garage,#Statement-non-opinion
so I got a g-, my gun and walked to the, you know, through the house into the garage.#Statement-non-opinion
There was no one there,#Statement-non-opinion
but I wanted to be sure.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, boy.#Appreciation
Is Plano beginning to experience the, the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan, you know, in the#Yes-No-Question
Unfortunately#Yes answers
urban area?#Other
yes.#Other
That's#Appreciation
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
too bad.#Other
I think, uh, you know, as any city grows up, uh, you get the hoods and the roof-, riffraff and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
everybody else#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in there,#Other
and I think,#Statement-opinion
uh, you know, fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, we've been, we've lived here sixteen years#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now you, you know, you can tell the change, for sure.#Other
Well, I was thinking, if you've been there that long, you've seen Plano grow#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
from what was really a, a small town to a city.#Other
Well, with all the, uh, Central Expressway, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
with all the stores and the, uh, restaurants and the#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, convenience stores and all that kind of stuff, it's just prime pickings for people driving by.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know and,#Uninterpretable
Well, I was appalled to read the other day about the, uh, uh, shooting on the tollway.#Statement-non-opinion
That's, that couldn't be too far from you, neither.#Statement-opinion
Uh, well, it's farther west of me.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
I live over near White Rock Lake.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
okay.#Response Acknowledgement
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
uh, it was really frightening to,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
think that, uh, it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway,#Other
.#Non-verbal
or for those people in the tollbooth.#Other
.#Non-verbal
Uh, I never thought about someone robbing those,#Statement-non-opinion
but, apparently, they do.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know, uh, how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it just doesn't seem possible, does it.#Yes-No-Question
It's kind of, kind of stupid, isn't it.#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
But I guess when people do those things, they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time.#Statement-opinion
It's, looks like#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
easy pickings#Other
and away you go, right.#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
and I think the drugs play a tremendous part in, uh, the theft and the, the violence that we see.#Statement-opinion
I think you're right, uh, although I think that may be an excuse for people, too.#Agree/Accept
It, it is convenient, isn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I didn't know what I was doing.#Quotation
Right.#Agree/Accept
That kind.#Uninterpretable
Right,#Agree/Accept
just like the old alcohol idea#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think people, uh, I think when you have haves and have nots, you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money.#Other
Well, yes,#Agree/Accept
and I work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, boy.#Appreciation
And, uh, uh,#Uninterpretable
Where do you work?#Wh-Question
Uh, do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are?#Yes-No-Question

Uh, no#No answers

Uh, just, not far off South Central Expressway.#Other
That's a pretty rough area there, isn't it?#Yes-No-Question
It is a pretty rough area.#Affirmative non-yes answers
We're over by Fair Park.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
And, uh, you know, you watch the people.#Statement-non-opinion
There are marvelous B M W -s and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
And the kids see that#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where, uh, you know, running for, uh, drug dealers if,#Statement-non-opinion
Definitely that area, that, that's big time.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Big time there, sure is.#Statement-opinion
It surely is.#Agree/Accept
I don't think I'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself .#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I'm careful.#Statement-non-opinion
Gee-,#Appreciation
that's the worst neighborhood in the whole c-, area.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's, uh, a little scary sometimes#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I manage the,#Statement-non-opinion

what kind of fishing do you enjoy?#Wh-Question
Well, uh, normally I like to, to go out fishing in a boat, and, uh, rather than like bank fishing, and just like to try and catch anything that's swimming, because I've had such problems with trying to catch any type of fish, that, uh, I just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing.#Statement-non-opinion
So, you like fresh water.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
I've never tried like with, deep, uh, sea water fishing#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because you get, I get sea sick#Other
Oh I see#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, one of these days, I'm hoping they'll have some kind of medicine,#Statement-non-opinion
so I can go out and go, uh, deep sea fishing.#Statement-non-opinion
Now, that would be nice.#Statement-opinion
Well, I was raised on the Texas gulf coast,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the summers,#Other
and during the Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so, I thought fish came out of the ocean#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
and anything that was fresh water was muddy#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I didn't learn to fish in a lake until I was well into my twenties#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
so I had, I had always been a, a sea fisher type#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which is a lot of fun.#Other
Oh I bet it is.#Appreciation
There's so many different ways to catch fish.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, at night you can go walking in the shallows, and gig flounder and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Which isn't technically fishing,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's a lot of fun.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I, I grew up fishing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What area of lakes do you like?#Wh-Question
Well, uh, now, I haven't done much fishing here in Texas, uh, because I moved from Ohio,#Hold before answer/agreement
Oh, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, but, uh, we did a lot of fishing when we were up there.#Statement-non-opinion
But down here, I have a brother that likes to go over on the east, in East Texas, and do fishing.#Statement-non-opinion
I can't remember what the name of the lake is,#Statement-non-opinion
and he was just here this past weekend.#Statement-non-opinion
I could have,#Uninterpretable
I, I think he mentioned it again,#Statement-non-opinion
but I couldn't remember what it was.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I want to call it Salt Fork, or Lake Fork.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I can't remember,#Statement-non-opinion
but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, oh, oh, uh, I think I know where, uh, Lake Caddo, or something like that.#Statement-opinion
I, you know,#Uninterpretable
that may be it.#Agree/Accept
That may be it.#Agree/Accept
If it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places. They hold tournaments there, and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he said that he has never gone anywhere before,#Statement-non-opinion
and he's fished all over the United States, in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen.#Statement-non-opinion
So I would love to go over there.#Statement-non-opinion
They were talking about going over there, and, and some time in the spring,#Statement-non-opinion
and I was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing, and, uh, and catch some bass.#Statement-non-opinion
I would love to do that,#Statement-non-opinion
but they have snakes over there,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and I'm not too welcome around,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't, I really don't want to share a boat with a snake.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just, I, I, I don't see it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just, I don't I think that I perhaps would let them have the boat or something,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I'd make some quick arrangements#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
and I've told so many stories about the snakes#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, when they pull in, there's a snake instead of a fish,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and things like that#Other
I'm just,#Uninterpretable
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know,#Hedge
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What's the largest fish you ever caught?#Wh-Question
Uh, gosh,#Appreciation
I think it was only like three and a half pounds,#Statement-non-opinion
and for me that's big.#Statement-non-opinion
That's why I'm saying I love to go fishing because I've never caught anything really, really big.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, so, because it's always been, you know, in the, on a lake, and, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I know they have bigger fish than that#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, three and a half pounds, and that was,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, on a lake,#Summarize/reformulate
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
huge for me,#Other
On a like that's not a bad size fish. *#Statement-opinion
yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's a good size fish#Statement-opinion
I would be impressed#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, but#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
I'd love to go ca-, catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing.#Statement-non-opinion
I've never done that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've, I've seen it, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and I have no problem going out in a boat, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just so dreadfully expensive,#Statement-opinion
and there's just so many other ways live down there.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's not a treat#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's what you do every day.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
You know.#Uninterpretable
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Uh, one of my favorite things was, we were forever catching crab and steaming them#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, out on the, on the beach#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you know, just, uh, pitching them out, on, uh, on, uh, what am I trying to say, newspaper#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and, breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them,#Other
Wow.#Appreciation
and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and that's it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, but, the other little creatures would take care of what was left.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
So,#Statement-non-opinion
that's right.#Agree/Accept
going out on a boat, never did appeal to me simply because it, you know, there was so much else to do.#Other

It most certainly is, so, uh, so that, it, it was, it was certain things that were enjoyable about it,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I don't, I think it's lost a lot of it's appeal since then, because of all the oil spills that they have had,#Statement-opinion
and, uh, it always smelled the entire time we were there.#Statement-non-opinion
It was,#Uninterpretable
I didn't realize that had happened,#Statement-non-opinion

We went swimming one time, in the whole week that, we were there,#Statement-non-opinion

we're neighbors.#Statement-non-opinion

Okay#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, but grew up in, uh, Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of lawn and garden#Statement-non-opinion
Hi#3rd-party-talk

Uh, and uh,#Uninterpretable
Can you hang on just a minute?#Action-directive
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Thank you#Thanking

Thank you.#3rd-party-talk
Uh-huh.#3rd-party-talk
I'm sorry.#Apology
No.#Downplayer
Go ahead.#Action-directive
So, uh, uh, not, not growing up familiar with here, uh, uh, when I get a chance I listen to that Neil Sperry and do that#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I do all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
I do all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
I get a lot of good tips from him.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh,#Uninterpretable
I have his book, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah?#Backchannel in question form
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Don't do any, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
any gardening in the sense of, uh, vegetable gardening#Other
but, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Not in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Tr-, tr-, tried some, tried some different,#Other
.#Non-verbal
flowers, and, and, uh, bushes and stuff,#Other
.#Non-verbal
and, uh, uh, have a, have a lawn service.#Other
There was one when,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
we, when we bought the house#Other
and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one,#Statement-non-opinion
but in terms of the fertilizing and, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
weed control,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
mainly leave that up to them.#Other
What about you?#Open-Question
Well, no,#No answers
I had a lawn service one year,#Statement-non-opinion
and I thought phooey, I'm going to do it myself because I figured up the cost#Statement-non-opinion
and I said, huh-uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can do it much cheaper and better.#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so what I did, I switched to liquid,#Statement-non-opinion
and I do it with an applicator with my hose,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the territory.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was surprised how easy it was.#Statement-non-opinion
Well#Uninterpretable
And, i-, I thought, well, I'm going to do this all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, good.#Appreciation
So I found, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and I've got some problems with, uh, two trees in my front yard,#Statement-non-opinion
and I took them to a certified, uh, nurseryman the other day,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and do you know what he told me I h-, needed to do?#Rhetorical-Questions
No.#No answers
Which is,#Uninterpretable
a-,#Uninterpretable
it's just unreal.#Statement-non-opinion
He said I needed to pull every leave off the tree,#Statement-non-opinion
and the tree is fifteen feet high,#Statement-non-opinion
and it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it#Statement-non-opinion
and he told me I needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he said I should purchase.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And I thought, uh-huh, this is, this is unreal,#Statement-non-opinion
this is unreal.#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, I think I'll get my son-in-law to do that for me, if he will.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What, what, what kind of a,#Wh-Question
is this some sort of a disease,#Yes-No-Question
or is it a pest?#Or-Clause
Yes,#Yes answers
it's a disease that it's got,#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
What,#Wh-Question
what happened to it, uh,#Other
and then it#Statement-non-opinion
Well, what kind#Other
it, um#Other
what kind of trees are they?#Other
Well, one is a maple,#Statement-non-opinion
one is, um#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a maple,#Other
but I would much prefer,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it's not a native Texan tree.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the one that, the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property,#Statement-non-opinion
and they don't,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
get any care,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they're cedar elm,#Statement-non-opinion
and they're just beautiful.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
So I mean, it, it's, you know, these things that you pamper,#Statement-non-opinion
some people have really a green thumb,#Statement-opinion
and, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, although I don't have too serious a problem,#Other
but, I don't know if it was from the, the, the late freezes that were, or the early freezes we had, that caused this tree damage,#Statement-non-opinion
and you know, Sperry said, you know, that's what happened to the Crepe Myrtles,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the last two years that, you, we are looking at all the freeze damage from the prior two years.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I kind of think that maybe that, uh, happened to these large trees that I have.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I really hate to lose them,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, that's one of the hazards I guess of, uh, having a, a yard.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's, that's one thing that we a-, we've had very poor luck with, with, is, in, in our yard is, is trees#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but the, uh, what, what trees were, were there when we moved in,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
uh, uh, were, had been put in by the developer when he built the house,#Other
and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree I think.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
the quick growing,#Statement-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
and they, and he,#Uninterpretable
And, uh, figured up last night, at,#Statement-non-opinion
there were seven different trees of, of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in,#Statement-non-opinion
and we got one left at this point,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, a couple of them we've lost to, the, w-, weren't too good trees, we've lost to wind, uh, uh.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Three we, three we've lost to, to, uh, freezes between, uh, eighty-three and uh, and then, uh, a year ago we lost, uh, another one.#Statement-non-opinion
Can I pick your brain about how you got rid of those trees?#Action-directive
Did,#Uninterpretable
are they still there,#Yes-No-Question
did you cut them down at the, at the ground level,#Yes-No-Question
or did you pull them,#Or-Clause
.#Non-verbal
up by the roots,#Other
or how did you get rid of them?#Yes-No-Question
Because if I#Uninterpretable
Well, d-,#Uninterpretable
I, I don't know how to get rid of these big trees, because one has a circumference of about ten inches,#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we-, we didn't ha-, we didn't have any that were that,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that big when they, uh, went.#Other
two o-, two of them, uh, the wind, the wind blew over#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Uninterpretable
uh, in, in terms of getting them down.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh#Uninterpretable
Because I don't want#Statement-non-opinion
the,#Other
stubs in my lawn.#Other
Because#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you still have to#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now th-, the one that, the one that we lost, the last one that we lost a, a year ago#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, u-, up until then, they do-, hadn't been big enough#Other
but what I just used a hand saw and sawed them off at, at,#Statement-non-opinion
The base?#Collaborative Completion
as close,#Other
To the ground?#Collaborative Completion
close to ground level as I could,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then, uh, got s-,#Other

got some chemical that drill holes and pour in that helps#Other
I see#Summarize/reformulate

uh, a stump killer.#Summarize/reformulate
stump ki-, yeah,#Repeat-phrase
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
stump killer, and stump, stump rotter,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, this last one had a fair sized root#Statement-non-opinion
and some guy was doing a job in the neighborhood, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and saw it and stopped in and asked,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
if I didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty-five bucks,#Other
and I said fine.#Statement-non-opinion
He had, he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that,#Statement-non-opinion
and it#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they get that saw,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it's a, k-, some kind of a s-, a screwing thing that just rips it right out.#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it, it just, it just ripped it#Statement-non-opinion
Right out,#Collaborative Completion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
right out,#Other
and, uh, I took the,#Statement-non-opinion
i-, it left the, it left, he left the chips,#Statement-non-opinion
and I put them up#Statement-non-opinion
Used those for, uh, mulch,#Collaborative Completion
sure.#Uninterpretable
mulch ar-, around, around the other shrubs,#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, uh, had, had a pile of dirt from various things, uh, back by the garage that I filled in with#Other
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's filling in with, with grass, uh, nicely this year, so that, that was, that was worth it#Other
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
A blessing in disguise.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I mean, y-, two fold purpose.#Summarize/reformulate

but, uh,#Uninterpretable

Lawn?#Collaborative Completion

lawn in terms of, uh, mowing?#Other
Yes,#Yes answers
I have a, I have a self-propelled, uh, Snapper.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I'm sitting on a hill,#Statement-non-opinion
and it, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
and it's very difficult to address.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, I, we just got a, a old push, uh, uh, Sears mower.#Statement-non-opinion
I, it's been fifteen years now, since we first moved to Texas, we've had it,#Statement-non-opinion
and I keep waiting for it to die,#Statement-non-opinion
but, every year it just seems to hang on,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, and, uh, I do it my, do it myself.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's good#Appreciation
They're very expensive.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we-,#Uninterpretable
a year, a year ago I took into,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
took it into Sears to have it tuned up for the season#Other
and they said, no, it's, it's too old,#Statement-non-opinion
we won't even work on it.#Quotation
Oh, booey#Appreciation
yeah.#Uninterpretable
And I took it back home,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's,#Uninterpretable
can't,#Uninterpretable
kept,#Uninterpretable
plugs along.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they always try to give you a song and dance.#Statement-opinion
But, my son's, uh, o-, one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have#Statement-non-opinion

Uh, I don't know.#Other
My personal perception of government and, uh, the way things are at this current time, is that nobody can really be trusted.#Statement-opinion
And I don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to, uh, be self-serving to the community.#Statement-opinion
I think that they have their own, uh, wishes to, uh, be in the limelight and to kind of say, hey, you know, I'm a public official, I don't have to do, uh, certain things#Statement-opinion
and they just stand out more. Involving themselves more and more with politics#Statement-opinion
but it's really,#Uninterpretable
after all the things that I've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts, uh, of checks, uh, before that it was the wonderful, uh, escapade that they had with, uh, the new, uh, oh God , chief of, uh,#Statement-opinion
well Supreme Court,#Statement-opinion
I'm trying to think of his name and, uh, what they put, uh, him through in regards to,#Statement-opinion
Thomas?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
Thomas.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The sex, sexual harassment, that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that.#Statement-opinion
I, I just think it's very corrupt and whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and send them into government versus people that are rich.#Other
But it's always the rich person that gets into government. That has the money to advertise, the money to d-, to do this.#Statement-opinion
There's no more Abe, Abraham Lincolns out there, uh, that can get into government, even if they were poor.#Statement-opinion
So, I know that's my personal viewpoint of things.#Statement-non-opinion
Doesn't Wisconsin have a, uh, state, uh, Medicare program or health program?#Yes-No-Question
Now, they just, uh, they've already put through the health bill#Affirmative non-yes answers
Yes.#Yes answers
It just went through#Statement-non-opinion
and it was passed#Statement-non-opinion
and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpla-, taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people.#Statement-non-opinion
You know what I'm saying?#Rhetorical-Questions
It, it's,#Uninterpretable
right now every little state around here is thinking about oh we need to reform the health, uh, system#Statement-opinion
and, of course, they think, uh, Wisconsin, our neigh-, or Minnesota, our neighbor, passed a state law, the health bill#Statement-opinion
and it's kind of like we're the first to do it.#Statement-opinion
So, I don't know if it's done because we're, we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for, uh, you know, a real good purpose to help people that can't afford, uh, health insurance, that kind of thing.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I, I think the, one of the biggest problems that, uh, we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, sure.#Appreciation
And that is, uh, uh, we become so debt ridden and credit oriented#Statement-opinion
Oh, sure.#Appreciation
instead of, uh, cash and carry or debt free#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and therefore, uh, that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities, state and federal governments.#Statement-opinion
It, it sure does.#Appreciation
And#Statement-opinion
.#Other
I think it, it is reflecting.#Other
Like you said I think society as a whole, uh, you can't expect, uh,#Statement-opinion
when we have T V -s and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for, uh, you know, immorality and this and this and this, that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be clean, totally clean#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And come into government.#Other
Uh, but down the line it does hurt.#Statement-opinion
I mean when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something, it's, uh, you know, it does hurt t-, each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or, you know, the other things that have occurred,#Statement-opinion
so, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, what is,#Uninterpretable
see the thing is, is when a lot of things become acceptable practice#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, it's hard to discern the bor-, what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical.#Other
And then#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Appreciation
someone blows the whistle and says, oh, this is not ethical and yes I did it too.#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
Well, that's exactly what happens in government all the time.#Statement-opinion
They blow the whistle on each other.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I hear that you're doing this,#Quotation
I've done it#Quotation
but oh boy,#Other
and it's not going to get out.#Statement-opinion
Ex-,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
e-, exactly. It's, uh,#Uninterpretable
there's no#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we just had,#Statement-non-opinion

I don't think anymore.#Other

Surely.#Agree/Accept
they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner.#Other

At that, it's pretty easy to do.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the, uh,#Uninterpretable
unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause, you have to, you know, wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
It doesn't make sense.#Statement-opinion
Uh, but it's, you know,#Uninterpretable
one of the most, uh, productive crop in the world#Statement-non-opinion

they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically,#Other

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that charges it.#Other
So the engine kicks on when the batteries need power#Statement-non-opinion
and it turns off.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Interesting thing about gas is when, I mean, about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light, you're not using any any energy#Statement-non-opinion
Huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That is good.#Appreciation
Unlike a car where it's running.#Statement-non-opinion

A electric car it's on demand.#Statement-non-opinion

Well, we were there when they had a#Statement-non-opinion

Well, uh, I don't know.#Hedge
I think the budget is really out of hand right now,#Statement-opinion
and especially in this election year, I think that, uh, there ought to be so-, at least some conversation about what#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we are supposed to do about this.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it kind of seems to me that everyone's offering, you know, their token little tax cut program, you know, when it's#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when it's just such a bad time for it.#Other
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, well, as you said, mostly they are token cuts.#Statement-opinion
Uh#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
especially what, for instance, George Bush is offering.#Other
The ninety-seven cents a week#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
ninety-seven cents a week.#Agree/Accept
Now what,#Uninterpretable
that's really not going to do a lot of good, it doesn't seem to me, to your average#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
middle income person, you know.#Other
Another ninety-seven cents,#Statement-non-opinion
hell you can buy a coke or something for that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, mostly it's, it's not actually a, a, a cut,#Statement-opinion
it's just a cut in the withhold, in the amount withheld, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't see this changing my lifestyle a whole lot.#Statement-opinion
That ninety-seven cents really isn't going to do it for me either.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I, I haven't really heard much of what the other people, other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either,#Statement-opinion
especially the Democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah, maybe that could do something to affect our budget#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at this point.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you know, in retrospect, um, was it, was it Mondale or Dukakis that said, you know, I'll, I'll tell you right now I'm going to raise taxes?#Or-Clause
I believe it was Dukakis#Statement-opinion
It was Dukakis,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
but I, I can't.#Uninterpretable
I have a lot of respect for him#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I mean that's better than George Bush who came out and said, No,#Statement-opinion
I will not#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
read my lips, or whatever *#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then, you know, ten months later he said, well, sorry, you know, I, I can't follow through on this. *#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it seems to me that, uh, that the budget is so out of hand,#Statement-opinion
and especially now that they say, Okay, the cold war is over#Statement-opinion
and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of, you know#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of X number of billion, trillion dollars a year.#Other
Well, I'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go,#Statement-non-opinion
because, in my opinion, I don't think I'm ever going to see any of this peace, so-called peace dividend.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's, it's.#Uninterpretable
I mean, if they could actually put something together and make,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not really in favor of large government social programs, either, because I feel that they waste#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
money, also,#Other
but with this peace dividend, it seems like you could set up some kind of like#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
public works projects like they had in the thirties, or whatever.#Other
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, uh, I, I think that would be a great idea, you know, like the conservation corps, you know where.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
ex-,#Agree/Accept
It wou-, it wou-, it would help unemployment greatly.#Statement-opinion
Exactly#Other
And it.#Uninterpretable
and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
infra structure is in, is in,#Uninterpretable
I mean, we, we, we have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty years in the#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and#Statement-opinion
cold war.#Other
and there's no way that we can ever really recover from, from the state that we're in right now, unless, at least I feel, unless we focus on the infra structure,#Other
and I surely don't hear anybody saying that right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I agree totally#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
Um, I mean, this, this, it just seems so, you know, so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen.#Statement-opinion

Oh really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

a couple of years ago.#Other
And one of the things we discussed was, you know, where our, where the budget situate-, how the budget situation just got so out of hand.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And essentially what happened was,#Uninterpretable
I think it was like in the, um, tax year of eighty-one, um,#Statement-non-opinion
Ronald Reagan basically said, you know, I'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and, and, created this, this ludicrous budget that he knew, that, that, um, that the Congress would not in their right mind pass#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and Con-, Congress, realizing that they were going to lose a, the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war, you know, bye-bye, you know, bye-bye removing the tax cut#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
further cut the taxes and created, you know, that, that, that, you know, created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you just, .#Uninterpretable
You, you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington.#Statement-opinion
I mean, it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun.#Statement-opinion

uh, well, it's, it's more than a loaded,#Uninterpretable
it's a loaded cannon.#Statement-opinion
I mean#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year,#Other
and they, in my opinion, don't do a very responsible job#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of spending that money.#Other
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

But other than that I've heard the, the, you know, the, um, the scenery in it#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
is absolutely beautiful.#Other
And, uh, the costuming *#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

yeah, was, *#Other
the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didn't, that, that, um, the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
probably#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to age, to age the material#Other
so, they, they did very authentic reproductions of the,#Statement-non-opinion
The styles,#Collaborative Completion

of the actual stuff,#Other
but they didn't, they didn't age it#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
quite enough it seemed.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it was a very good movie.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I guess I will have to see it then.#Statement-opinion
What have you seen lately?#Wh-Question
Um, actually have been to the movies, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I think the last movie I saw was MISERY.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I didn't see that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, very suspenseful.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't, I don't like Stephen King.#Statement-non-opinion
I really don't either,#Agree/Accept
but I went with someone,#Statement-non-opinion
and once I was there, I couldn't believe.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it's an excellent movie.#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
I wasn't sure,#Statement-non-opinion
because, uh, just generally, you know, that kind of scary stuff I, I just don't want to have anything to do with it.#Statement-opinion
It's not necessarily, it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it's not.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think I heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something, you know.#Statement-opinion
No,#Reject
in, in the book apparently she cuts his feet off,#Statement-non-opinion
but in the movie she, she disables him, but not by cutting his feet.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, she, she breaks both of his ankles.#Statement-non-opinion
Ugh.#Appreciation
And that I couldn't watch,#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So yeah, um,#Uninterpretable
that was so that he couldn't leave her,#Statement-non-opinion
cause she,#Uninterpretable
It still just seems a little twisted to me#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah#Agree/Accept
I mean, *#Uninterpretable
I'm not sure I would have enjoyed that at all.#Statement-opinion
Yeah, *#Other
well, as far as that goes,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you wouldn't like to see anybo-, anything happen to anybody,#Statement-opinion
but it was just how she got so caught up,#Statement-opinion
her emotions#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, and, and she feel madly in love with this writer.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And there was this,#Uninterpretable
but she was a killer,#Statement-non-opinion
and the, the character was, you know, prior to that had, had been someone that had killed other people#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but no one knew that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Appreciation
So. But.#Uninterpretable
So, yeah,#Uninterpretable
we just haven't had the time to go to the movies lately,#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Agree/Accept
we don't see movies at the movies a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The last,#Uninterpretable
we did go see DANCES WITH WOLVES#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't think I want to see that either.#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Uninterpretable
I don't think I could.#Statement-non-opinion
I think, uh,#Uninterpretable
well, now, we had some friends that went to see it#Statement-non-opinion
and they said it was okay.#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, it might not be as,#Uninterpretable
I think they may be playing up#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects.#Other
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Now, we went to see the JAGGED EDGE.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I liked that movie.#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the thriller suspense and not, not real, um, strange in other ways.#Other
Uh-huh, um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I guess that's about it.#Conventional-closing

On my mother's side we've had several,#Affirmative non-yes answers

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's not really on a regular basis,#Other
but usually sometimes every few summers.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, all, see, all the family lives in once place, except for a few of us are scattered about.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So they're pretty much just reunited always#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it's, it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, it might be a good time for you to be-, to, to start a tradition.#Action-directive
I know,#Agree/Accept
that's#Uninterpretable
You could be responsible for that yourself.#Action-directive
do that,#Uninterpretable
that's true.#Agree/Accept
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How about your family?#Open-Question
Well, in my family, let's see, last October was the forty fifth annual#Statement-non-opinion
Wow,#Appreciation
you're,#Statement-opinion
uh, reunion.#Other
a pro at this.#Other
The first Sunday in October, the Jordan family gets together.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's good.#Appreciation
And all of the descendants of the Civil War, I mean, yeah, the Civil War veterans come together,#Statement-non-opinion
and they come as far away from California,#Statement-non-opinion
and there's usually oh, between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people.#Statement-non-opinion
And then where do you meet?#Wh-Question
Uh, there's a big community hall in Vernon#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Texas,#Other
and, uh, that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Do you have relatives in Vernon#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
then?#Other
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement

A lot of the older family lives in Vernon.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, all of his direct descendants, descendants have now died#Statement-non-opinion
and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
So we're talking about second and third great children here.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I take my boys well, I took them up until this year,#Statement-non-opinion
they're grown and gone from home now#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so they, they take their family.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
that would make them, grandfather, great grandfather, great great grandfather,#Statement-non-opinion
okay,#Uninterpretable
so it would be the second great grandchild.#Statement-non-opinion
And so they,#Uninterpretable
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so this town hall that you meet in, is that like a, um,#Yes-No-Question
Well, it's a community center, it's a community hall.#Dispreferred answers
It's,#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen it in,#Other
and, uh, you just bring the covered dishes.#Statement-non-opinion
Every, every family brings a, a dish of some kind,#Statement-non-opinion
and you get all the wonderful old family recipes,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that have been handed,#Other
Potato salad and, uh,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
down for years#Other
Well, we try to stay away from those things which might have, uh, salmonella in them.#Dispreferred answers
Oh, that's good.#Appreciation
And we choose to bring congealed salad.#Statement-non-opinion
You can bring a congealed vegetable salad,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as opposed to potato salad.#Other
And we are very conscious of, most of us are very conscious of, of, uh, sanitation aspects,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whatever you've got to carry for any distance.#Other
I always,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
take home baked bread.#Other
Oh, that's nice.#Appreciation
Uh, that happens to be my specialty for that family.#Statement-non-opinion
I do other things very well,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but there are others in the family who do them better.#Statement-non-opinion
Do they always have the, the one person in the family who knows, or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best,#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
so that's what they get to cook.#Other
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
Well , I had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions,#Statement-non-opinion
so I learned a lot about them.#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
been to a lot,#Other
but we talked,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a lot about the, the rituals,#Other
you all equated the family reunions as,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with the Protestant.#Other
It was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was, it was an interesting theory.#Statement-non-opinion
She talked about the, uh, the Catholics#Statement-non-opinion
all, it's a home centered, you know, it's all family centered anyway,#Statement-opinion
so you usually are living where your parents live#Statement-opinion
and it's all,#Uninterpretable
your, you don't have to come home,#Statement-opinion
so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe,#Statement-non-opinion
but when the Protestant ethic happened in America, there were people who ever went out and, you know, went away from the family to seek their fortune, and then had to come back home for their reunion, so that,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
became their version of the pilgrimage.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But she had,#Uninterpretable
it was interesting, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know how valid it is,#Statement-non-opinion
but she talked about that and how the, the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together, and, um, you know, about the bread and the ritual placement.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you have a, a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every, every year?#Yes-No-Question
Is there kind of a, you know,#Yes-No-Question
salads go first and things like that?#Yes-No-Question
Well, it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
we have, uh, uh, kind of a core group that, that serves as, quote, officers of the organization,#Dispreferred answers
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they plan the reunions,#Statement-non-opinion
the organize the, you know, who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there, who's going to rent the tables, who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and each year it's done a little bit differently, because different people serve in those roles.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's pretty .#Appreciation
We have a biographer who, who continues every year to save clippings on any family member,#Statement-non-opinion
and they're entered into a, a wonderful, uh, scrap book. And pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and, and obituaries to those who are gone.#Statement-non-opinion
And it keeps the family alive,#Statement-non-opinion
Sure does.#Agree/Accept
That's wonderful.#Appreciation
even, you know, even though it's very fluid.#Other
And they're very dedicated to that,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it's been really wonderful.#Statement-non-opinion
It helps you hang onto your roots.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I wish we'd,#Statement-non-opinion
And it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging.#Statement-opinion
My husband, on the other hand, was not very close to his family.#Statement-non-opinion
His family was very scattered and very diverse.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I asked him, I got to talking to him,#Statement-non-opinion
I said, well, how is his nephew doing.#Statement-non-opinion
"Well, I don't know,#Quotation
I haven't,#Quotation
.#Non-verbal
talked to my brother in three years."#Other
I said , "Well, how's your brother doing?"#Statement-non-opinion
"I don't know."#Quotation
Uh, you know, my son keeps in touch with him, I think,#Quotation
but I don't.#Quotation
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I said, "Hey, wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people?"#Statement-non-opinion
"Yeah,#Quotation
but I'm, you know,#Quotation
it's too much trouble."#Quotation
So I got busy, got together, and put a reunion together for his family.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
You're just, uh,#Uninterpretable
And succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one#Other
Oh, that's incredible.#Appreciation
to our place down at Lake Tawakoni.#Other
Liked to kill me, because I ha-, it was, I didn't have that group cooperation,#Statement-non-opinion
I did,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it by myself.#Other
And, uh, nobody brought covered dishes.#Statement-non-opinion
We had a great big fish fry,#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, I fixed a salad in a number three tub.#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and, uh, it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them#Statement-non-opinion
and I told him,#Uninterpretable
Have you, have you done this repetitively, or just once?#Or-Clause
We did it that year,#Statement-non-opinion
and then the following summer, we did not have all of the family there.#Statement-non-opinion
We sent invitations.#Statement-non-opinion
We said, "Please let us know if you're coming."#Statement-non-opinion
It was when, uh, his mother, his step father had died the year before,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
and it,#Uninterpretable
his mother was alone, and so they came to support her,#Statement-non-opinion
and then one by one, his broth-, you know, his sisters, he began to lose family members,#Statement-non-opinion
See, that's#Uninterpretable
we've we had a problem with that.#Statement-non-opinion
and it was difficult to hold them together.#Statement-non-opinion
And then, of course, he died two years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
so, you know, that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
And, uh, it,#Uninterpretable
I think that's what happens when they get scattered,#Statement-opinion
the, the family unit, you know, falls,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
That's our, was our problem.#Statement-non-opinion
into disrepair.#Other
We had, uh, the first reunion, or the first, you know, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then the second reunion, people who maybe, you know, had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought, oh, well, it's not that big a#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
thing this year,#Other
and so it kind of wound down,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then finally, you know, you're lucky to get, you know, you get the Shreveport relatives there, but no one else#Statement-non-opinion
so that,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, see, we manage, those people who are at that core group manage to keep, keep the vigor alive.#Statement-non-opinion
They'll send out news bulletins.#Statement-non-opinion
Two or three times a year you'll get a news bull-,#Statement-non-opinion
hey, guess who got, you know, elected to the legislature,#Quotation
or guess who our local sheriff,#Quotation

I guess when you're, when you're eighteen or so, uh, it would be important to know if it was a coed college#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
That was a, a strict requirement for me.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, again what, uh, how serious a person is according to, uh, uh, you know, what, what they want to get out of school, and, uh, I guess they'd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home, if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home.#Statement-opinion
Uh, let's see, uh,#Hold before answer/agreement
now what was the question,#Wh-Question
what, what's the criteria for picking a college?#Wh-Question
What advice#Wh-Question
What advice.#Repeat-phrase
would you give?#Other
Oh, okay, uh,#Response Acknowledgement
I guess one clear-cut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Uh, stay in a dormitory if you can.#Statement-opinion
Go to classes,#Statement-opinion
talk to faculty members and students.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
and also, uh, depending on how, uh, uh, adjustable your child would be, or, or flexible, I guess it would be, uh,#Statement-opinion
if, if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe the, they were unused to their, that, the way they run things,#Statement-opinion
I mean, the, the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges, I think.#Statement-opinion
The people are different#Statement-opinion
and, uh, you have to be more flexible and more willing to, uh, uh, adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things.#Statement-opinion
You know, you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you're used to. Uh,#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
I'm thinking#Hold before answer/agreement
You think so ?#Yes-No-Question
what, what problems my children might have in that, uh,#Other
but I agree with you.#Agree/Accept
Uh, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
what else.#Hold before answer/agreement
Uh, well, climate would be,#Uninterpretable
you know, you'd have to#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, is somewhat,#Uninterpretable
if, uh, if it's something different than the one they're used to, I guess, uh,#Statement-opinion
if they're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need to go out and play all the time, not be in studying If you're in Florida or California. Uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I, I'd also advise them that, uh, if mom and dad paid for their college, that, uh, if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year, then they'd have to get a loan to continue.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Well, course it, it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and your willingness, one, to, to work during the summer or, or#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
part time.#Other
There's,#Uninterpretable
And two, uh, to, to take out loans to assume, uh, debt after college.#Other
The, the responsibility of that.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, uh, uh, they could, they could work and earn money towards college.#Statement-opinion
Also if they stay within their state, you get a lot more financial aid#Statement-opinion
or it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
than if you go out of state to a private school, uh,#Other
and, like I said, if they was willing to work, uh, in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third#Statement-opinion
and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is.#Statement-opinion
By the time, I have an eleven year old is my oldest,#Statement-non-opinion
so, it's not too far away,#Statement-opinion
but it's,#Uninterpretable
Mine is twelve.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it's getting there,#Statement-opinion
I mean, we still have, definitely can put away the money for college now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I would advise that, that they did not have a car at college.#Statement-non-opinion
They would,#Uninterpretable
That's my gut feeling, too.#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
my son is certainly not persuaded of that#Statement-non-opinion
Hello?#Other
Yes,#Other
I'm here.#Other
Oh, yeah, uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I didn't have a car in college.#Statement-non-opinion
I#Statement-opinion
No.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
think it's more an in-, a burden to, to provide for.#Other
I think so, too.#Agree/Accept
I think, I think because most kids don't have a car at college, the ones that do get taken advantage of#Statement-opinion
and, you know, there is just, I think it's just trouble waiting to happen.#Statement-opinion
So I would advise they didn't, they didn't take a car#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Is it,#Uninterpretable
they didn't take a television#Other
and they didn't take a refrigerator#Statement-non-opinion
Maybe that,#Uninterpretable
Uh, I didn't do any of those, though,#Statement-non-opinion
I#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I,#Uninterpretable
feel less strongly about the T V -s and refrigerators.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we didn't have,#Statement-non-opinion

Well, as far as I'm concerned and it's probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching, uh, REASONABLE DOUBTS.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which had a, you know, capital case in it.#Other
And, uh, m-, I personally have, uh,#Uninterpretable
my own feelings about, uh, capital punishment is I think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony.#Statement-opinion
I do, too.#Agree/Accept
Mandatory, I mean, summary execution, on the steps, that day.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
well, I think, you know, I'm, I'm in that same,#Statement-non-opinion
I think if it's, uh, if it's a con-, if it's a convicted, uh, felon on parole#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, and he goes out and, and commits another crime or kills somebody, I, you know, I, I feel the same way,#Other
I don't think, I think that person is, is beyond, uh, rehabilitation#Statement-opinion
and, and he should be taken out#Statement-opinion
Well, I, I also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I do know that some people, almost all people usually die before that point.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They just get too old.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, as far as capital punishment, on, on it's own merits, I have the trouble with the way it's applied.#Statement-non-opinion
I think it should be applied, d-, on a little bit more fair manner.#Statement-opinion
Uh, and I've, I've said this very often#Statement-non-opinion
and I believe it to be the, a very true axiom,#Statement-opinion
so I would be rather be white, rich and guilty than black and innocent.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because if you're if you're black and you kill a white guy, you're going to fry.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Kill you.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They will kill you.#Other
And if you're black and you kill a black guy, you know, it's, you know, two hundred hours of community service.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you don't hear, you don't hear too much about, of those cases.#Statement-opinion
Well, it's a social#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
disease that we have called one upsmanship, you know.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We're the majority,#Statement-opinion
so we can do whatever the hell we want to do.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
And you're the minority#Statement-opinion
and you're stuck with it.#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, you know, we had this in the Vietnam war, you know,#Statement-opinion
we had you know,#Uninterpretable
population of blacks among military people in Vietnam was about eighty percent.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But the population of blacks in the military was about twenty-two percent.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The handwriting's on the wall there, isn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Yep,#Yes answers
it sure is.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, but that's another issue altogether.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept
it's,#Agree/Accept
As far as capital punishment, I think that, uh, ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment.#Statement-opinion
I think the guy should have ninety days#Statement-opinion
and if he can't produce evidence#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
not argument, but evidence,#Other
See, the only thing I don't, you know, I don't understand, I guess I, I don't understand our judicial system, uh, as it is right now#Statement-non-opinion
because I, you know, if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death, how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of ex-, execution?#Rhetorical-Questions
I mean, how, you know, is#Uninterpretable
Well,#Uninterpretable
there,#Other
Th-, that goes back to when, uh, America was a, a colony of England.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In England, you went to court, you were assumed guilty until proven innocent and once they found you guilty, you know, judge said, he's guilty, kill him.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, th-, there were some people that, uh, that had a problem with that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because they found out later on that, jeez, you know, a guy will lie rather than get killed.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he'll say, you know, hey, that guy did it, you know, not me.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, or he'll have somebody lie for him.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, people lie,#Statement-opinion
it's a#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
strange thing,#Other
but they do that,#Statement-opinion
and to prevent that kind of misuse of power, they wrote into the Constitution a protection#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
against judicial mishap.#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the judicial mishap in this event would be, hey, you got the wrong guy.#Statement-non-opinion
Look at that guy, uh, at E Systems.#Statement-non-opinion
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They were g-, they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He was too far away when it happened.#Statement-non-opinion
He had witnesses that were, you know, they weren't dope dealers, they weren't drug fiends, they were employees of a, an establishment that had a very high level of security sense, too. And these were really responsible people.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and they convicted this guy because somebody says, well, he looks like the right guy.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
They all look the same to me, you know.#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Big lips, flat nose, yep, that was him.#Quotation

it is.#Statement-non-opinion
I've been wanting to go to the West Texas, and see different parts of Texas, because I haven't lived here very long,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay,#Other
uh, what do you consider an invasion of privacy?#Open-Question
Uh, I was just now told that's what the topic was#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I guess invasion of privacy, uh, to me, for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for example.#Other
And, uh, I guess recently one of the T V stations here, uh, ran a series of, uh, news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers.#Statement-non-opinion
It's very easy.#Statement-opinion
And use it#Other
and I was quite surprised at that.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess I can consider myself fortunate that, uh, it never happened to me.#Statement-non-opinion
Now, I've never,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know what I'd really do if it did.#Statement-non-opinion
I've never had that happen to me either.#Other
What do you think about places,#Open-Question
like I was in Michael's the other night and charged something,#Statement-non-opinion

What do you think of that?#Open-Question
Uh,#Hold before answer/agreement
Does it bother you to give it?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
not really because I'm listed in the phone book.#Statement-non-opinion
If I was the type of individual that, uh, had an unlisted number, I, I think I would be hesitant to give it.#Statement-non-opinion
You know that they, they now have a, uh, I believe it's a federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on charge tickets.#Statement-non-opinion
One of the things that upset me when I lived in California was, uh, they did a lot of things with s-, your Social Security number.#Statement-non-opinion
Security number,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
As a matter of fact, they even went to the point of printing our Social Security number on your driver's license.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they would not cash checks unless they had your Social Security number,#Statement-non-opinion
so we had our Social Security numbers imprinted on our checks.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I was really, you know, unhappy about that situation.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that was an invasion of privacy.#Statement-opinion

I, I don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given, you know, when I have to cash a check.#Statement-non-opinion

One of the biggest things, I think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of, uh, mail lists and things like that.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes.#Agree/Accept
You know, uh, recently we, uh, I purchased some magazines, U S NEWS#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and FORBES magazine.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And every since that day, I have been inundated with, you know, uh, subscriptions to this, subscriptions to that, uh, this news letter, this investment letter, uh, even to the point of people calling me at home.#Statement-non-opinion
And prior to me ordering these magazines, I never got those kind of calls.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
I discovered with, uh, charge cards, uh, I feel like that I don't know whether it's the stores themselves that sell the list or whether the, uh, uh, credit report bureau sells it,#Statement-non-opinion
but I get catalogs from people I've never even heard of.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I know they have to be coming from my charge cards, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
From some, some list,#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
From some list, you know, that knows that I have a, say a charge account at, at Neiman's or something#Statement-non-opinion
because then I'll get catalogs that, you know, are within that range#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that I would never order from#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
ordinarily,#Other
and, uh, you know, and I get, I get tired of that.#Statement-non-opinion
I, because I look at all that junk mail,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think of how inept our post office is and how that's taking up#Statement-opinion
All their time.#Collaborative Completion
you know, all their time to sort#Other
and they're not even paying full postage.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and if you did away with some of that, our postal service might give better service.#Statement-opinion
I think the general public would be, you know, uh, tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for, uh, let's say the criminal individuals to, to get access to people's records, uh, their credit cards#Statement-opinion

driver's licenses, checks, things like that.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Computers caused a lot of this, I'm sure.#Statement-opinion
Well, you know, let's face it,#Action-directive
computers can be gotten into very easily if you, if you really have the, the know with all, if you're, you know, so inclined to, uh, oh, what do I want to say, have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that.#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and have a basic knowledge,#Other
they're very easy to get into.#Statement-opinion

We, we don't know, half the time we don't know who to support.#Statement-opinion
Are you, uh, relating this, uh, to the, uh, affair we've got going on in Haiti right now?#Other
That, and, you know, maybe it's, maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with, with, uh, countries like that that depend on us so much#Affirmative non-yes answers

without, you know, just telling them, running their country for them#Other
but,#Uninterpretable
That, that's just it.#Appreciation
It's got to be tough,#Statement-opinion
but, I mean, uh, uh, you sure, you still have to, you know, let them know how you feel.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
I guess my concern, you know, no matter which, no matter which side we take we're going to have supporters and we're going to have, uh, antisupporters, I guess, for lack of better term,#Statement-opinion
and, uh, like you said, they're such small countries, that we're bound to upset somebody,#Agree/Accept
but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it worries me that, uh, the economy of so many countries in, in South America and Central America depend on something that damages people, like the, you know, like cocaine#Statement-opinion

from Columbia,#Other
and#Statement-opinion

uh, you know, of course I, I'm sure we have some enemies down there who wouldn't care what happened to us,#Other

That's true.#Agree/Accept

and it,#Uninterpretable
I don't think that,#Uninterpretable
maybe I, maybe it's, you know, I'm reflecting how I feel about it,#Statement-opinion
but I have a feeling that we, that we really don't understand basically the, the, the competing factions in lot of those countries#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Agree/Accept
I mean, they've been hammering , for the last, you know, ten centuries,#Other
and it's still going on,#Statement-opinion
and, uh, we, we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how,#Statement-opinion

some times,#Other
Yep,#Agree/Accept
that's about the lump sum of it.#Agree/Accept

she was from El Salvador#Statement-non-opinion

I can see his face forget his name#Affirmative non-yes answers
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I know it, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
anyway, when he came into power, he basically just took everybody's property, you know, just assigned it to himself.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
kind of nationalized it#Statement-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for himself,#Other
right,#Agree/Accept
and, uh, so she's been a real strong supporter of the Sandinistas and has been trying to back the U S government in that respect,#Statement-non-opinion
and in that respect I have to agree that I think we're taking the right stance#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, because they were a democracy turned, uh#Other
Dictator,#Collaborative Completion
yeah,#Agree/Accept
right#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
basically a dictator fascist.#Statement-opinion
And it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing,#Statement-opinion

Well, what do you think of, uh, this, uh, U S free trade agreement we're working on with Mexico?#Open-Question
Well, I think it's long overdue#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I just, you know,#Uninterpretable
there's so much difference in, in the economies of the two countries, I'm not, you know, I have a problem, uh, with whether it's going to work or not, you know,#Statement-opinion
there's, uh, it seems like there's,#Uninterpretable
and I,#Uninterpretable
this may be unfair to Mexico,#Statement-opinion
but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in, in foreign policy a lot of the times.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
Mexico,#Uninterpretable
they're, I know they're trying, they're really trying, the Mexican government is trying,#Statement-opinion
and a lot of the larger Mexican businesses are trying to, oh, make themselves Americanized, I guess#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, which is great because that's what they basically need to do.#Other
The big problem with the United States is we have our basic nine to five schedule#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
and#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we don't have the Siesta,#Other
and there's, the cultural differences is what's, is what's kind of, it's what's really hurting, uh, the Mexican people, because they've had their way of life,#Statement-opinion
and we've had our way of life,#Statement-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
I think their, their version of the good old boy network going that,#Statement-opinion
uh, you know, has a lot,#Uninterpretable

Okay.#Other
Did you want me to go ahead?#Yes-No-Question
I'll let you go ahead and start, yeah.#Agree/Accept
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Well, one thing,#Uninterpretable
I, I guess both of us are very much aware of the equality.#Statement-opinion
Uh, it seems like women are, uh, just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in, uh, jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did.#Statement-opinion
Uh, it's not uncommon to see men doing dishes, making supper, or taking care of the kids#Statement-opinion
or som-, uh,#Uninterpretable
the generation of my parents and my great grandmother which, uh, they did everything.#Statement-non-opinion
They went to work#Statement-non-opinion
and they took care of the family,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
You know, I think that's changed just in the last generation.#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Just in the last little while. Because I know my father-in-law doesn't do that much,#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of that kind of stuff#Other
but my husband is wonderful.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's the way my husband is too.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it, it doesn't, uh, doesn't bother him at all to do the dishes.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It doesn't bother h-, him at all to do the laundry verses, uh, men from way back.#Statement-non-opinion
There is that,#Uninterpretable
well, if you did that you were henpecked or whatever.#Statement-opinion
But,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
men are starting,#Other
There are still some that aren't cooperating#Statement-opinion
but#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
those are very few.#Statement-opinion
I think those men don't last very long in relationships because I think women know what they want.#Statement-opinion
They're not accepting that anymore.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
exactly.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's, it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything, uh, you know, and then kind of real light pay.#Statement-opinion
There's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all.#Statement-opinion
So it's, it's kind of a, uh, neat thing to see as far as equality in the households,#Statement-opinion
and I think that's even going to get better. Even, you know,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even more so.#Other
I think it's just going to be where men will do as much cleaning as women do and that it won't be your job description instead of your role definition is this.#Statement-opinion
It will be, uh,#Uninterpretable
hopefully for my daughter who I instill into, it doesn't matter if you want to drive a truck, honey,#Statement-non-opinion
or it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse,#Statement-non-opinion
it doesn't matter if you want to be, uh, the President,#Statement-non-opinion
or it doesn't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor,#Statement-non-opinion
it doesn't matter.#Statement-non-opinion
It's what you want to be.#Statement-non-opinion
So I have always instilled into her,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think mothers, um, are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say, hey, you don't have to stay with nursing,#Statement-non-opinion
you don't have to be a secretary,#Statement-non-opinion
you don't have to be,#Statement-non-opinion
you can be whatever you want to be. Whether it be a welder or trucker or whatever#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
As long as you, uh, go to school for it and get the education,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I feel like, um, to an extent that is really important,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, that, that, um, it is important for women who need to work#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, or are in a position that they want to#Other
If they want to, right.#Collaborative Completion
that they can do that.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, but I also think it is important for them to be with the children.#Statement-opinion
I do too.#Agree/Accept
I,#Statement-opinion
You know, there's a certain part of me,#Statement-non-opinion
I think there, there are some things that women just are designed to do better than men.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And there are some things that men are designed to do better than women.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't think it should ever be totally equal.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know that's not, uh,#Uninterpretable
we're not made like that.#Statement-opinion
Well, emotionally I think, uh,#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
women do a little bit, uh,#Other
I, I think that's, the gap is coming closer a-, as, um, what I've learned in, uh, just, just being out there.#Statement-opinion
It seems that men are now starting to get into groups called men's gatherings,#Statement-opinion
and they get together#Statement-opinion
and they talk about issues of marriage, talk about manhood, talk about what they didn't have with their fathers.#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Are expressing more emotions, learning what emotions are.#Statement-opinion
It may be in the future that men, you know, some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves.#Statement-opinion
Um#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I know of some mothers that I, I guess I'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding, more, um, low key, more apt to be a better father than some mothers that I have seen that have been raised, you know, to develop whatever skills that they have,#Other
and some of the men are developing, uh, very good too.#Statement-opinion
So,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it may come down to where it's, it's individual basis. Where everybody is treated an as individual,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and not by sex.#Other
If you want to stay home and take care of the kids, honey, that's fine.#Statement-non-opinion
I will go out and make the, uh, take care of the, uh, money making.#Statement-non-opinion
And it, it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that.#Statement-opinion
One of the frustrations that I have with the way things have developed is that, and for some it's not a problem, but there's more and more, it's difficult for a family to make a living on one#Statement-opinion
On one income,#Collaborative Completion
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
income.#Other
It can be done,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but you make sacrifices.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that,#Uninterpretable
You know, and, and it's, um,#Uninterpretable
Kind of like what, uh, my husband and myself are doing right now.#Statement-non-opinion
My daughter's three, even though at this current time she's ready to get involved with,#Statement-non-opinion
she's an only child.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you've only got one,#Other

Recently graduated from high school. Meaning like, uh, you know, three or four years ago.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm a senior in, in, uh, college now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I can't really talk too much about the problems with, uh, public education in detail because the school system I went to was, uh, really superb even though it was a public school#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
system.#Other
Yeah.#Yes answers
I feel that my, uh,#Statement-opinion
I'm a junior in college now.#Statement-non-opinion
And#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay.#Statement-non-opinion
I go to Tech, Georgia Tech?#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I,#Uninterpretable
I got a friend who goes there, by the way#Statement-non-opinion
I want to as-, talk to you about that afterward,#Statement-non-opinion
okay.#Tag-Question
Okay#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh, I've,#Uninterpretable
the high school I went to was, uh, was a good one also.#Statement-non-opinion
And I, well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools.#Statement-opinion
Because the one I went to was, you know, I'm sure a, a lot nicer than, you know, a lot of the inner city schools and#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the things around Atlanta.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was a, a, it's a more or less a suburban school system?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That, that was true for mine too.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, although I I'm sure to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but I don't think, I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it.#Statement-opinion
You know, I#Statement-opinion
What d-,#Wh-Question
think that, uh, I mean I know that in my town, you know, most of the, most of the parents, they're valued education.#Other
And, uh#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
you know, and so the students were, you know, to some extent, motivated to learn.#Other
I mean#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I'm also#Uninterpretable
you know#Other
I mean, in the, in those places where, uh, like the economy is really bad, they might, you know, be more tempted to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, you know, money to put food on the table and stuff like that. More than they would you know, in areas where they#Statement-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
But but, uh, I think, I mean even more than that, even, I mean if you drop out in high school#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you should still be able to read you know?#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
That's true.#Agree/Accept
Which it , I mean it sounds like, uh,#Other
now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, uh, they have of these, uh, sort of mandatory -tory tests if you have to take before you get#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a diploma.#Other
But, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but, uh, certainly before that, there were people that, you know, would graduate from high school and could barely read.#Other
Uh, and that's just sort of inexcusable#Statement-opinion
and you can't really,#Uninterpretable
I, I, I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, except maybe to someone whose, you know, really badly learning, uh, disabled or something.#Other
But these people obviously weren't.#Statement-non-opinion
That's hard for me to say since I didn't,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I didn't really grow,#Other
well when I went to elementary school it, it wasn't in a great area#Statement-non-opinion
but I still, I mean, I learned to read, started learning to read when I was in kindergarten, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I guess I can't really#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can't say what it would be like to, uh, grow up in a really oppressed region#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, I guess the whole, the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
And I think that's almost a bigger factor,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
than anything else probably.#Other
I mean, I don't, I think you know, people just,#Statement-opinion
So, I guess the problem is the, the thing to do is to try to, uh, to get some kind of motivation to learn#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, again, I don't, I mean#Uninterpretable
they got to know the, you know, how qualified, I mean,#Uninterpretable
I think it'd be interesting#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to, you know, to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. Uh, you know, sort, sort of maybe from elementary through, uh, high school.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, just sort of to get a feel for what it's like.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that'd be an interesting experience.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, I haven't done that#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I can't say that I have either.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
But I do, I do think that, uh, I mean, public education in general I think can work.#Statement-opinion
And I think it's a good thing.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've, I've heard some, I mean I've heard sta-, sta-, statistics and things that, that compare a public education to a private education. I mean within like, within the same, uh, income groups.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If you compare the, like the people that could have, that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that, you know, the people that, uh, did send their kids to private#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
schools.#Other
I think they compare fair-, you know, fairly well.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, I don't, I honestly don't really think I could have, you know, done much better than I did in the school system I was in.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean .#Other
I, I, I, my schools, I mean, there,#Uninterpretable
I have a lot of#Statement-non-opinion
once, once it seemed I got into high school, they had a lot of, uh, accelerated programs and all kinds of#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
stuff like that.#Other
That, I mean, that makes a big difference#Statement-opinion
cause I wondered when they're taking classes with, uh, with people that are really, are interested in the, the subject and stuff like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, and and in the,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
once you book junior high, uh, start junior high, starting in eighth grade all the way through high school, there were four levels.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, no,#Reject
I guess it wa-, in junior high, it was still three.#Statement-non-opinion
Then in high school it changed into four levels of, uh, of instruction in the major subjects.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, which,#Other
I mean, actually I think that works pretty well.#Statement-opinion
and that, that makes,#Uninterpretable

Well, discussing air pollution today, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, uh, well, give me your first impressions.#Action-directive
Uh, I don't know,#Hedge
there's a lot of air pollution.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I think industries and companies provide a lot of it#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, with, uh, I guess with the oil burning over in Kuwait and stuff, that would have a lot of air pollution in it.#Statement-opinion
Uh, puts a whole,#Uninterpretable

gets a whole new picture to what real air pollution can be,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, that stuff going on over there.#Statement-opinion
What, what, uh, what part of Pennsylvania are you in?#Wh-Question
Um, I'm north of Pittsburgh,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, it's, it's amazing too, you know, with that, with the oil wells burning over there, that's the exact same stuff that's coming out of cars every day, just in, uh, just in a little different grade, I guess.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, in Dallas, we've got, we've just, uh, brought in a whole new set of requirements on inspections and things like that for cars, because, uh, people just don't use mass transit and stuff in Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
Everybody loves their car,#Statement-opinion
and you see an awful lot of, uh, one person vehicles on the road on, during rush hours.#Statement-non-opinion
That seems to be our biggest problem down here.#Statement-opinion
Um, you know, there's, uh, there's a lot of industry around,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, it's not, it's#Uninterpretable
any pollution that industry's dumping around here is not going into the air.#Statement-opinion
It's typically water type situation.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um. We have a couple, we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
and I know there's a lot of air pollution going in there,#Statement-opinion
and like they, they get fined whenever they do the air pollution#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but the fine is nothing, you know,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, it's,#Statement-opinion
it's like nothing to them.#Collaborative Completion

so I was never, I was never exposed#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to anything of, of the, of the sort.#Other
Um, there were always E P A people and what not were always telling us that, uh, farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but we just, we just never saw the results.#Statement-non-opinion
There was, there was dust in the air during planting seasons and what not,#Statement-non-opinion
but that, that was all we ever saw,#Statement-non-opinion
and then five years ago I moved to Dallas,#Statement-non-opinion
and I suddenly started to understand what burning eyes, and all that stuff is about that I'd always heard about.#Statement-non-opinion
It, uh, it's, it gets, it's real depressing.#Statement-non-opinion
In the morning sometime you can tell if it's a good day or a bad day by, uh, how far out from downtown, uh, you can be on the road and still not see it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my God#Appreciation
And, uh, yeah,#Uninterpretable
I mean, it's not,#Uninterpretable
I don't think Dallas is considered, uh, a real bad place for air pollution,#Statement-opinion
but, you, you can tell, you can tell the differences in the days, when it's, when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a, a foggy, misty color#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, it, it's a little, it's a little disappointing sometimes you start to realize what you're breathing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, I don't know what they can do to really prevent it, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Like, how,#Uninterpretable
what can they do about the oil burning over in Kuwait?#Rhetorical-Questions
What, you know,#Uninterpretable
I mean they fine the industries,#Statement-non-opinion
but you know, that doesn't seem to stop them there#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know what else they can do.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It, it's that there really isn't a whole lot.#Statement-opinion
It's one of those, uh, it's one of those things that if they do a little bit and, uh, and, you know, e-, every little bit does help,#Statement-opinion
I do believe that.#Hedge
Um, but I also believe that the earth is a kind of a self-regulating system,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it will clean itself up, eventually.#Statement-opinion
It,#Uninterpretable
the whole idea is not to, not to push the limit too hard, I guess#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
let the, you know, let the natural, natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just don't understand, you know, what else anyone can do about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't think it's something that people really think about, either.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, it's, I mean, it, it should probably be a big issue, you know, because it's, it's doing a lot of damage,#Statement-opinion
but I,#Uninterpretable
it's something, you know,#Statement-opinion
I don't think many people really think about it, because it's nothing they,#Statement-opinion
I don't think we really have too much control over it.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's one of those things,#Statement-opinion
it, it's so hard to measure what, what the damage is#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's kind of like, oh,#Statement-opinion
I guess it's kind of like, kind of like cigarette smoking, you know.#Statement-opinion
It, it could go on for years and years until they start to see some results and people can actually, actually say, Yeah, it's, it's, it's doing, doing some damage#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and something's got to be done.#Other
Um, there's, you know, there's a lot of things like that.#Statement-opinion
It,#Uninterpretable
you can, uh, you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks,#Statement-opinion
but until it breaks, you don't really know that there, you were doing anything to it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
exactly.#Appreciation
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, I really don't know too much else about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, that's, that's,#Uninterpretable
I think we both agree it's, it's one of those deals that, uh,#Statement-opinion
I just think there's a lot of other problems right now#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, we've done a lot to take care of it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we have tried,#Statement-opinion
I mean, you know, and, um, I, I know where, you know, where a couple of the mills that have,#Statement-non-opinion
I know they put things on their stacks, you know, to filter the smoke, and do all kinds of things,#Statement-non-opinion
but, I mean, every now and then it breaks, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you just have smoke going out into the air for a day or two, until you can get it fixed.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so, so, you know, it's something we, we have tried to help.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, there's no doubt about it.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know if you ever happened to see some of the like, Twenty Twenty and what not about Rumania and East Germany when they first got pictures out of there#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
about how some of their systems had been running for twenty and thirty years#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, you know, they had absolutely no regulations, no controls whatsoever,#Statement-non-opinion
and they had destroyed entire forests and what not, just because the air was so polluted.#Statement-non-opinion
That's, that's the kind of things that, uh, you don't see in this country,#Statement-opinion
and that's, that's why I think that, you know, it's,#Statement-opinion
I don't know if you can ever do enough,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I think it's all relative to the, to the time and place,#Statement-opinion
and I think right now it's, it's pretty much under control.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
okay,#Uninterpretable
well.#Uninterpretable
All righty.#Conventional-closing
Uh-huh.#Conventional-closing
It's been nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Well, you bet.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

So, the ques-, the question had something to do with usage of personal computers, um.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
we are, we are talking about computers this morning.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I'm a firm believer in, in having lots of them.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sitting at my desk now with four machines in front of me.#Statement-non-opinion
You have, you have four machines around you,#Summarize/reformulate
boy, well, you've, uh, you've got me beat.#Statement-non-opinion
I have a, a Zenith here#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and at home I have a Commodore#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a Zenith,#Other
and my wife has an A T and T Twelve Hundred, I believe it is.#Statement-non-opinion
Good grief.#Appreciation
What do you do with all those?#Open-Question
Well, actually on my Commodore I mainly study lottery numbers, would you believe.#Statement-non-opinion
I have written some, uh, programs in Basic#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whereby I can select any number of, uh, drawings#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the most#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have another program in which I can look at the cyclical, uh, appearance of these numbers#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to see if there's anything that's consistent on that.#Other
I have another number that allows me, another program that allows me to add all the numbers I want,#Statement-non-opinion
and then it generates a complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so this is what I do most of the time, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
That's what you do on your, at least one of your machines#Declarative Yes-No-Question
On my Commodore#Affirmative non-yes answers
on your Commodore.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on my Commodore,#Affirmative non-yes answers
uh-huh.#Uninterpretable
And of course I have, uh, word processors,#Statement-non-opinion
and I write all my letters#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's wonderful, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
my, uh, thoughts in my head#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
come in bursts of about a paragraph at a time,#Other
and I get#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
them all down,#Other
and naturally on a computer if you make a mistake, who cares,#Statement-opinion
you can go back and, uh, correct it very easily#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes.#Agree/Accept
so that makes it very, very nice.#Statement-opinion
I get all my thoughts down and go back and clean it up very, very readily.#Statement-non-opinion
So how about you, Charles?#Open-Question
Well, I, um, I do an awful lot of preparation of documents, um, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and I use word processors and, and fancier programs, I mean#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, graphics programs and simply make all of our slides,#Other
some of them I do on a Sun,#Statement-non-opinion
some I do on an X T#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now maybe we don't call these personal computers, um,#Statement-opinion
I started out with, you know, an I B M P C back in the, you know, about a year after they came out#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know.#Uninterpretable
So, whe-, where, may I ask where you work, sir?#Wh-Question
I work for the government in Washington.#Statement-non-opinion
I know you work for the government,#Statement-non-opinion
I just wondering are you an ,#Yes-No-Question
or what, what, what section of it,#Or-Clause
Of, in, in, in an obscure part of the defense department.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because, see, that's my type of work, too.#Statement-non-opinion
I work at the Applied Research Lab#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
here, here on campus,#Other
and, my, my field is underwater acoustics#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and there's a lot of things we can do with computers into, uh, studying how, uh, things vary in the water, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, taking advantage of them, and so forth,#Other
so it's a very nice, very nice field,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I am retiring at the end of this month. End of December, excuse me.#Statement-non-opinion
Are, are, are you, are you also a professor,#Yes-No-Question
or, or do you#Or-Clause
Yes.#Yes answers
just research.#Other
I'm a, I'm an associate professor,#Statement-non-opinion
but my, I, I'm a full time researcher#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's, uh, been a very, very interesting career, believe me.#Statement-non-opinion
I can believe.#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
What are you going to, what are you going to do when you stop, I mean, take all your machines with you, or,#Yes-No-Question
Well, uh, the ones here in the laboratory obviously I'm, they're going to stay,#Negative non-no answers
but I have similar machines at home.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I would consider doing some more consulting when I get home#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I have a very, very busy extra life anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm also a musician,#Statement-non-opinion
and I play in several symphony orchestras#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I run a concert band,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I have a lot of external, uh, interests#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I do want to get very deeply, much more deeply into computer work, because obviously the world is going to be controlled#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
run and operated#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
by computers in the future.#Other
There's no doubt about it,#Statement-opinion
because it is really taking over,#Statement-opinion
and the amount of work that we're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers, because, uh, it's so much involved#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it sounds as though you're probably more aware of that than I am, because, uh, I don't get to use it in my daily work as much as I would like to.#Statement-non-opinion
Here again#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
let's say I'm starting to getting ready, in preparation for retirement#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, so basically what I'm doing is slowly getting rid of my things.#Statement-non-opinion
For many, many years I had a full size acoustics, uh, study laboratory#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whe-, where I could take recordings and, and, uh, perform experiments#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with them and so forth,#Other
and so that's gone now,#Statement-non-opinion
and so I'm sort of out of business.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, as I say, I worked with#Statement-non-opinion
fellow named Steve Blazey#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
was the fellow I worked with for many, many years#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he is now retired.#Statement-non-opinion
So it's been an interesting life,#Statement-non-opinion
and computers have come in towards the latter end of that.#Statement-non-opinion
I wish we had had computers in the very beginning.#Statement-non-opinion
It would have been,#Uninterpretable

What kind of lawn and garden work do you do?#Open-Question
Well, right now the place where I'm living, the yard was basically neglected for about the last twenty-five years,#Dispreferred answers
so I've been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn,#Statement-non-opinion
and after three years of working at it, I've, I've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back.#Statement-non-opinion
Instead of mowing in the same direction every time, changing, one day you'll, or one time you'll cut it, cut the lawn the long way, then you'll go the opposite way, instead of going lengthways, you go width,#Statement-opinion
and it helps the grass come back.#Statement-opinion
Oh, does it really?#Backchannel in question form
I didn't know that#Statement-non-opinion
Did, um, you've been working on it for three years?#Yes-No-Question
Thr-, f-, for three years.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Really?#Backchannel in question form
What have you done?#Wh-Question
Killing lots of fire ants.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I was firmly convinced the entire,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
front yard was nothing but one gigantic ant mound.#Other
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because it was like, you could, you couldn't even stand still out there.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I can barely hear you#Statement-non-opinion
Is this better?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
a little bit, yeah#Statement-non-opinion
It was like you'd go out in the yard to water something, you'd just be standing still.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the ants would start crawling up your legs.#Statement-non-opinion
It's like, I'm not standing in a mound, though.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
How did you get rid of them?#Wh-Question
Uh, Dursban Two.#Statement-non-opinion
Pardon?#Signal-non-understanding
A chemical called Dursban Two,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, Dursban Two,#Response Acknowledgement
it's a crystal.#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Dursban will get rid of just about anything, I think.#Statement-opinion
But um, so you haven't had a problem with that, since?#Yes-No-Question
Um, not bad.#Other answers
Every,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
once in a while you'll have a mound pop up,#Other
but that's, gon-, to be expected.#Statement-opinion
What else did it , did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to?#Yes-No-Question
Um,#Hold before answer/agreement
Not really.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
as far as I can tell it hasn't killed anything it wasn't supposed to.#Negative non-no answers
Even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it didn't kill it.#Other
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Well, that's pretty wild.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
we used it for fleas.#Statement-non-opinion
We had fleas in our yard real bad last year,#Statement-non-opinion
and we did that um,#Statement-non-opinion
I just, I'm not,#Uninterpretable
basically, I like to mow the lawn, believe it or not,#Statement-non-opinion
but I sometimes have problems starting the mower,#Statement-non-opinion
so a lot of times I won't get out and do it,#Statement-non-opinion
but my husband, basically, does most of it,#Statement-non-opinion
and he does the, you know, edging and all that kind of thing,#Statement-non-opinion
and we're renting,#Statement-non-opinion
and so we don't really put a lot of money into the, uh, you know, like#Statement-non-opinion
this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt, and some Saint Augustine.#Statement-non-opinion
We just, we have winter rye out back,#Statement-non-opinion
and we have,#Uninterpretable
I don't even know what it is out front,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, we, this is the first house we've ever lived in,#Statement-non-opinion
and we're just not real into the lawn probably because we're renting, I guess, huh?#Statement-non-opinion
So, it, anyway,#Uninterpretable
Well,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard?#Yes-No-Question
Right#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
We were getting,#Uninterpretable
Uh, I found one thing that, it's kind of a weird thing to say to put out on the lawn,#Statement-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
every time I've done it, it's got-, it, it drives the fleas completely out of the area.#Other
What?#Wh-Question
Powdered sulphur.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Hm, I wonder why it does?#Wh-Question
You, you don't have to put a whole lot out,#Statement-non-opinion
just if you've got a broadcast spreader#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it comes in a forty-pound bag,#Other
and it's real fine, like flour#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you just#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
go out, and do the entire yard,#Other
and you, I mean, you don't have to put clumps of it,#Statement-non-opinion
just very lightly cover the entire yard.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Well, I'll have to remember that, because hopefully we won't have them this year,#Statement-non-opinion
but we have a cat that comes in and out,#Statement-non-opinion
and the cat was getting, um, fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house,#Statement-non-opinion
so we had a real problem last year with fleas,#Statement-non-opinion
and uh, it was quite a drag because, um, we got them in our house,#Statement-non-opinion
and we're Christians,#Statement-non-opinion
and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas,#Statement-non-opinion
and we got rid of them, believe it or not, with smoke bombs, which is just about impossible to do,#Statement-non-opinion
but we did,#Statement-non-opinion
and so we don't want them back this year, you know?#Statement-non-opinion
so I'll remember that if we see it's a problem in the yard.#Statement-non-opinion
we're almost,#Uninterpretable
they were so bad last year, even ticks.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
we've had ticks before a lot,#Statement-non-opinion
and we've had to get out and treat our lawn for that.#Statement-non-opinion
I think we used Dursban for the, we used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing, you know, and spread it all out everywhere,#Statement-non-opinion
but that's about the extent of our lawn care.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I don't know,#Hedge
do you enjoy doing it?#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
Oh, I love it.#Affirmative non-yes answers
My wife can't understand#Statement-non-opinion
it'd be a hundred degrees outside, I'll be out there.#Statement-non-opinion
But it's too hot to be working in the yard.#Quotation
.#Non-verbal
I'm under the trees,#Quotation
I'm having fun,#Quotation
and I'm stopping to drink water,#Quotation
so what's the problem?#Quotation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well that's, well that's funny.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
not everybody enjoys it, though.#Statement-opinion
Everybody has a different thing.#Statement-non-opinion
I kind of enjoy it#Statement-non-opinion
and my husband doesn't#Statement-non-opinion
I kind of have to,#Uninterpretable
sometimes I'm too busy to get out there and do it,#Statement-non-opinion
and he, you know, he doesn't really enjoy doing it,#Statement-non-opinion
but he'll do it,#Statement-non-opinion
and he doesn't gripe about it or anything,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, I'm kind of like you#Statement-opinion
and he's kind of like your wife.#Statement-opinion
I mean, you know, in that he doesn't really enjoy it,#Statement-non-opinion
but I would like to have a garden, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
that's my thing,#Statement-non-opinion
but right now where we're living we have the trees where their, uh, roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know what kind of trees they are,#Statement-non-opinion
but you can't have a garden,#Statement-opinion
you can't till it,#Statement-opinion
or it'll, it'll tear up a nice tiller#Statement-opinion
So we're going to wait until we move.#Statement-non-opinion
We don't have a lot of sun, either, because it's big trees back there.#Statement-non-opinion
So we're going to wait,#Statement-non-opinion
and when we move that's one of our priorities, is to get a house where we can have a, uh, garden.#Statement-non-opinion
And so I'd like to do that.#Statement-non-opinion
I have a feeling I'll be out there all the time taking care of that,#Statement-non-opinion
but that's our next thing#Statement-non-opinion
Do you have a garden?#Yes-No-Question
I've got, the,#Uninterpretable
this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at.#Hold before answer/agreement
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sitting on about a two acre lot now,#Other
and half of it's,#Uninterpretable
the back half is my garden.#Affirmative non-yes answers

That sounds fun.#Appreciation
Where do you all live?#Wh-Question
Uh, in Missouri City.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
wh-,#Uninterpretable
Southwest, southwest side of Houston.#Statement-non-opinion
Southwest where?#Signal-non-understanding
Southwest Houston.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Oh, because we're in Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess I assumed you were here.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's neat.#Appreciation
And, um, yeah#Uninterpretable
that's what we want.#Statement-non-opinion
We have a,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
that's really what we want,#Statement-non-opinion
but we just haven't been able to do that yet,#Statement-non-opinion
so one day we'll be able to do it,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm excited about it.#Statement-non-opinion
And then I don't know anything about it,#Statement-non-opinion
I have to learn,#Statement-non-opinion
and then you'll have to give me a call on gardening#Action-directive
.#Non-verbal
What do you do in your garden,#Rhetorical-Questions
and I'll go nothing,#Statement-non-opinion
what should I do?#Rhetorical-Questions
But anyway, I guess that's about it though.#Conventional-closing
It sounds like we've covered all the bases#Conventional-closing
so I guess we'll let you go,#Conventional-closing
and, um, do you have anything else you wanted to say?#Conventional-closing
Uh, no,#Conventional-closing
it's just,#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
I've had an en-, very enjoyable conversation with you.#Other

Well, what I believe is one of the major pro-, uh, things that is wrong with our public school system is that, um, we do not have enough discipline#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be#Statement-opinion

disciplined right now.#Other

about being disciplined,#Other

in going to school is just totally different.#Other

Oh, no,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
They always had a paddle in our school.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Well, they, they just don't do that any more.#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
But the school system's afraid of getting sued#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid#Statement-opinion
and we still don't have enough money towards#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
put in toward public school.#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
And, um, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for, if we#Yes-No-Question
Yes#Yes answers
approve it?#Other
supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.#Other
.#Non-verbal
You know, I don't know your feelings toward that.#Declarative Wh-Question
I guess we shouldn't get into that#Action-directive
but,#Hold before answer/agreement
.#Non-verbal
um, and what else, um,#Other
I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have heard stories, uh, from other parents that I know of, their children are in high school#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,#Other
No.#Reject
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Oh, yeah,#Yes answers
Ooh.#Response Acknowledgement
I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh. Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job right now.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I do too,#Agree/Accept
I think they're doing real good job.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so.#Uninterpretable
But, then, what do I know,#Rhetorical-Questions
You don't have any children in school?#Yes-No-Question
I don't have any kids.#Negative non-no answers
Don't have any kids.#Other
No,#No answers
none at all#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Response Acknowledgement
okay,#Response Acknowledgement
so this is probably a real hard subject for you.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Oh, yeah#Yes answers
Yeah.#Response Acknowledgement
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
well, I guess, um, we can discontinue our call now.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
It was a joy in talking with you.#Conventional-closing

Well, um, with credit cards is, me, I, uh, I try to get maybe just one or two,#Other
I don't, I don't like having credit cards for every store.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I, uh, I just don't like them#Statement-non-opinion
What are you afraid of with them?#Wh-Question
What am I afraid of?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Um, I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much.#Statement-non-opinion
I just, uh, don't think that I need them, you know.#Statement-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
uh, they are tempting at times,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but I, I just, you know, sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing everything about me, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's very, can be very, very true.#Agree/Accept
So, and th-, you know, everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money#Statement-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's the idea.#Statement-opinion
They figure that,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if they give you card,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at no charge for a whole year that you will use it#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
That's right.#Agree/Accept
See they make money off of it, whether you use it or not.#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
Well, the other thing, of course, is the fact that they hope,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you will not pay your bill at the end of the month,#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
so that you would be paying interest.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I use mine a great deal, um, for groceries, for everything that I can and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then just write one check at the end of the month,#Other
That's what I do.#Statement-non-opinion
for the entire thing,#Other
right.#Uninterpretable
That's what I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Just a second.#Action-directive
Sorry#Apology
That's all right.#Downplayer
Sounds like you have a little one there.#Summarize/reformulate
I have two little ones.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Oh, you have.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
So tha-,#Uninterpretable
Great.#Appreciation
How old are they?#Wh-Question
um, four and two and half.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, boy. Those are two very active ages#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
So, yeah,#Agree/Accept
um, I'm, I'm like you#Statement-opinion
I, I use my, only use my credit card for, um, you know, when I, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I just use it whenever I feel like I don't want to write a check,#Statement-non-opinion
and then, but I don't charge anything that I can't payoff at the end of the month.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
Well, uh, do you, uh, do you ever use the A T M machines?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I never do.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband does at work just to get cash out,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I take the checkbook#Statement-non-opinion
so I, you know, I, just, if I need cash, I just tell him#Statement-non-opinion
and he gets it out#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't even think I know my number#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in order to get cash.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
See we, he couldn't do without it, h-, but, you know, since he can just do it right there at work,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that helps.#Collaborative Completion
for nothing .#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well the, the other thing some people are not aware of, is they will use their A, their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and when they do that, they begin paying interest right from that very day on.#Statement-opinion
You're right.#Agree/Accept
And that's kind of silly.#Statement-opinion
Yeah right.#Agree/Accept
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because they,#Statement-opinion
You're defeating the purpose.#Statement-opinion
they figure that, that's correct#Other
.#Non-verbal
The idea is to use their money#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, during that whole month and,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then pay it at the end of the month.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I mean, I get, I get at least one or two a week.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
People, t-, you know, sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and I just say I don't want it.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I,#Uninterpretable
Well, I think that's the only thing you can do, is just say no and mean no and,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
It's like,#Statement-non-opinion
not be tempted.#Other
I'd like to know where they determine that I'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say, you get this much credit line. You know.#Other
Well, i-,#Uninterpretable
You've already been preapproved.#Quotation
oh, absolutely,#Agree/Accept
preapproved.#Agree/Accept
That's their favorite word.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Everybody in the country is preapproved, I think.#Statement-opinion
I think so, you're right.#Agree/Accept
So,#Uninterpretable
Well, it's interesting, uh, that, uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
people have the, generally the same view.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of credit cards,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
no matter where you go.#Other
And, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you know, one day they find, wow, I didn't realize I had this much,#Statement-opinion
That much stuff.#Collaborative Completion
you know, I'd spent this much money.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it.#Statement-opinion
Well, and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, I mean, that does nothing, but exacerbate the entire problem.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it does because you're, you know, you, you're, you know, you're just co-, costing yourself more money because you, if you can't make the monthly, the minimum payment, you're paying interest,#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
again#Other
so,#Uninterpretable
That's right.#Appreciation
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so,#Uninterpretable
Well it's been enjoyable talking with you.#Conventional-closing
Yeah.#Conventional-closing
It's enjoyable talking with, seeing that somebody feels the same way,#Conventional-closing
so, well,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Conventional-closing
Well take good care.#Conventional-closing
Take care of your little ones.#Conventional-closing
You, you too.#Conventional-closing

Okay.#Other
How's the weather been out there?#Wh-Question
Well, the last three days it's been pretty rainy.#Statement-non-opinion
We went to the beach#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, it started, uh, let's see, around four o'clock,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and, uh, it had thunder and lightning,#Statement-non-opinion
it was, and then, you know, it was just overcast and rainy for, uh, the next two or three days straight.#Statement-non-opinion
How about yours?#Open-Question
It's pretty normal for this year, you know, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
they have tornados about once a week,#Statement-non-opinion
and it rains about every three days.#Statement-non-opinion
The last two years before, they've had record rainfall.#Statement-non-opinion
By this time of the year they'd had enough rainfall for the whole year,#Statement-non-opinion
but this time we're only, um, I think, maybe five inches ahead of, of, uh, normal.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's not been bad at all.#Statement-non-opinion
You're from Virginia?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
I'm from Texas.#Negative non-no answers
Oh, from Texas.#Response Acknowledgement
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
And, uh#Uninterpretable
I heard they had some flooding down there.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, they had some flooding in Houston the other day, real, real bad#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
over, I think it was over the weekend.#Other
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The radar just looked nasty#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with a bunch of red splotches all across it.#Other
Well, the last couple of years, we're, um, we're over as far as our rainfall goes.#Statement-non-opinion
Before that it was really dry,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Other
everybody was, you know, talking about rationing water and doing this and doing that.#Other
Not really rationing water, but just cutting down.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Other
that's,#Agree/Accept
And, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
that's right.#Other
it seems like, uh, you know, the weather pattern is just shifting, and, uh, that, uh, jet stream is moving, uh, into our area, North Carolina#Other
There y-,#Uninterpretable
and across,#Other
but it's, uh, changing latitude.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so you get a lot more rain that way.#Summarize/reformulate
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Brings in that cold air#Statement-non-opinion
and mixes it with the, with the warm air coming off the Atlantic Ocean.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's what,#Uninterpretable
It's finally cleared up.#Statement-non-opinion
It's just now st-, still a little overcast,#Statement-non-opinion
but the s-, but the sun has finally started popping out.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Is the temperature like sixty-, sixties to eighties there too,#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Oh yeah,#Yes answers
well, right now, as a matter of fact I'm fixing to go play tennis.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, um, I'd say it's at least seventy-nine, eighty, well, about seventy-eight, seventy-nine degrees.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, do you get east winds a lot of the time from the ocean#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Um, actually the, uh, the wind normally blows, let's see, let me think about this, south, southwest.#Dispreferred answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, but a-, but actually our, I guess our weather pattern comes from the, uh, blows north east,#Reject
yeah#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you're right,#Statement-non-opinion
it blows north east.#Statement-non-opinion
That's the way it does here most of the time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, sometimes it just comes straight from the north#Statement-non-opinion
and then it, and then it doesn't veer off to the east until you get down to Houston, or, or, uh, maybe mid, mid-Texas#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
depends on how strong the cold fronts are.#Statement-non-opinion
How f-, how far are you from Houston?#Wh-Question
Um, well, uh, Richardson's a suburb of Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see,#Response Acknowledgement
so you, so you don't hav-, you don't get anything off the Gulf, uh, immediately from, from the ocean.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Hardly ever, unless there's a hurricane or something like that.#Negative non-no answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, uh, it's kind of early f-,#Uninterpretable
I was going to say, the weather man on, on, uh, one of our stations was talking about the way that the weather's doing now is like tropical weather,#Statement-non-opinion
and he was afraid if it kept doing that, that they'd have er-, early hurricanes this year.#Statement-non-opinion
Um. Well, we've had some, you know, pretty, pretty rough winds.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh, Bangle-, Bangladesh, boy, they, they caught it bad#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Kind of wiped them ou-,#Statement-opinion
But we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes.#Statement-opinion
I know, uh, Hurricane Hugo,#Statement-non-opinion
you probably heard about that.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Uh, last year.#Statement-non-opinion
Wiped everything out.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and they're still, uh, rebuilding from that storm,#Statement-non-opinion
and so the, the beaches here just get really beat up#Statement-non-opinion
and it usually comes this way#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It comes up from, uh, Miami#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, down around, or, you know, around the Bahamas,#Other
and it usually travels, uh, northwest,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits.#Statement-non-opinion
Do y-, do you get many tornados this time of year#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Um, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
two years ago we had one,#Statement-non-opinion
as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, it was real odd.#Statement-non-opinion
The m-, barometric pressure drops during a tornado,#Statement-non-opinion
and our, uh, fire alarm went off.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So of course that woke everybody up,#Statement-non-opinion
and we knew what was going on, to, uh, you know, go downstairs or go into the bedro-, bathroom and, uh, take cover.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, we get, uh,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Yes answers
we're, we're, uh, we get our share of tornados.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the, uh, uh,#Uninterpretable
you, you aren't in the mountains or anything like that, are you?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
huh-uh.#No answers
There's just hil-, there's just hills.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
We're about two hours from the beach.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, you know, it's, uh, barometric pressure I believe is higher in the mountains,#Statement-non-opinion
and we cat-, we catch some winds, you know, a few winds coming off of them, I think.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
you all just had a tornado, uh, over close to Oklahoma and Texas?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
they, they had a lot of them.#Statement-non-opinion
They had a, a huge one that was on, um, INSIDE EDITION the other night, in, uh, the southern part of Kansas.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, they took a bunch of film of it.#Statement-non-opinion
It, uh, kind of chased them.#Statement-non-opinion
It was a few hundred yards away#Statement-non-opinion
and it chased them under an underpass,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was tossing around the car#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gosh.#Appreciation
right before it got there,#Other
and it tore up the people inside the car.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, did it?#Backchannel in question form
And the n-, the camera man on the news crew held the camera out,#Statement-non-opinion
they were hiding underneath the underpass,#Statement-non-opinion
and he held the camera out as the tornado went by.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And y-, the, the wind, you know, it had a mike on it,#Statement-non-opinion
and the wind and everything was incredible.#Statement-non-opinion
Um. Boy I would have like to have heard that.#Statement-non-opinion
That cou-, would have been something.#Statement-opinion
I'm surprised they didn't, they, because we saw it on the news a couple of days in a row#Statement-non-opinion
and that, and you know, and that was way up in Kansas.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But over here, it's a lot, it's a big thing about tornados and people that get pictures of them.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I used to live in Amarillo originally.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I'm,#Uninterpretable
you can really see them well there.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Oh yeah.#Yes answers
We used to sit out, uh, especially in Borger, we use to sit out on our back, uh, picnic table and watch them come out of the sky through the funnel clouds#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground.#Statement-non-opinion
But otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them go in and out of those clouds.#Statement-non-opinion
It's really strange the way it does that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Especially the way it starts.#Statement-opinion
It starts, you know, just like a little swirl in the clouds,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, uh, then it just grows from there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it, and, and usually it's not even raining when it starts.#Statement-non-opinion
It's just.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you'd be amazed at how clear the sky was,#Statement-non-opinion
but the clouds are just really, uh, uh, rolling#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
kind of just real pillowy, I guess.#Other
That's right,#Agree/Accept
and they're black,#Statement-non-opinion
and sometimes they're even green colored.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well I was in that, uh, big tornado went through Wichita Falls.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the sky,#Uninterpretable
I mean, we were right in the middle of it, when, I mean, signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And a whole roof of a restaurant came off.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, it was a eerie, uh, a real eerie blue-green color.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the lightning was almost continuous, just, uh, you know, as if you put your hand on one of those electric, uh, things that causes lightning.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I think it was called the storm.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's it.#Agree/Accept
But, um, the s-, the whole sky was full of that eerie blue-green, uh, lightning.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
And that's about, that's what we get this time of year, just, all the way, sometimes all the way through June,#Statement-non-opinion
the last, especially the last two years, it's rained, uh, what, I think it rained nine inches in, in one, one of the Junes the last two years.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And this year,#Uninterpretable
u-, we usually get about five inches in May,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, it's over that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We haven't got that much rain,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, when it rains, it's, it's been downpouring.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
All right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well I hope you have good weather the rest of the summer.#Conventional-closing
You, too.#Conventional-closing
Have fun playing tennis.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
thanks.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay,#Other
so, what are, what are your views on capital punishment?#Open-Question
I have ambivalent feelings because I don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is.#Statement-non-opinion
But, on the other hand, it is very, very expensive to maintain,#Statement-opinion
you know, Texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
And it's eating us alive budget wise#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
So are they currently practicing capital punishment#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
we#Statement-non-opinion
in your state?#Other
do practice capital punishment,#Other
but the nature of the, uh, courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's similar to Georgia.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then, I was reading in the paper just this morning, it's interesting because I had forgotten, I guess, that I wrote this little topic down, that it costs more to execute somebody th-, than it does to keep them.#Statement-non-opinion
That's probably true considering,#Statement-opinion
Because of all the costs of the appeals and all that#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I guess in a way that, it, it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if,#Statement-opinion
Well, I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
You know, who would see it.#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
that would be the intent of it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I'm not sure how successful that is.#Statement-opinion
Well, I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner, if there weren't so many#Statement-opinion
Quicker#Summarize/reformulate
appeals.#Other
maybe,#Other
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
if, if the person who's going to commit the crime#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
knew that they were going to be punished severely, possibly capital punishment,#Other
What, what kind of work do you do?#Wh-Question
Uh, I'm a research engineer,#Statement-non-opinion
I work, uh, f-, with Georgia Tech.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, well, see, I'm a school principal.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
Elementary school.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And in a very poor section of town with p-, predominantly Anglo kids.#Statement-non-opinion
And I see kids already that are going to be criminals#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
in spite of everything we can do#Other
and, see, I'm afraid I think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people, that,#Statement-opinion
I mean, course, you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I think we would make a bigger investment in kids,#Statement-opinion
we'd have fewer decisions to make.#Statement-opinion
Um, that's probably true,#Agree/Accept
but I guess#Statement-opinion
Down the road, you know.#Other
there's other factors that,#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, p-, p-, pumping more money into the school system is a#Statement-opinion
Well#Statement-non-opinion
good thing,#Other
but it's not going to,#Statement-opinion
I'm not talking about just in the school system.#Other
Oh, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
See, I'm talking about,#Statement-non-opinion
like, in, in,#Uninterpretable
uh, I'm afraid I think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I know the institutions don't work that well,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's a bad day because I get all these kids through my office.#Statement-non-opinion
I have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Five hundred of them are good, solid kids#Statement-non-opinion
and I have the same thirty-seven in my office every day.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
And a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible.#Statement-non-opinion
Some of them in the penal system.#Statement-non-opinion
So that's a difficult situation.#Appreciation
And, you know, you just see those kids going down the road.#Statement-non-opinion
Now, not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment,#Statement-opinion
but some of them have already been in youth centers.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
And that kind of thing,#Other
and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals,#Statement-opinion
and I'm not talking about necessarily in the school system,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's one reason we have problems in schools, uh,#Statement-opinion
and some of them are our problems,#Statement-opinion
but a lot of it's because everything society wants, we are supposed to do.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But that's another subject#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's probably true.#Agree/Accept
W-,#Uninterpretable
Anyway, I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has, making a decision what to do with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess that's not an easy solution.#Statement-opinion
There's, there's no easy#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
solution for that.#Other
I don't, I don't know that there is an easy solution,#Agree/Accept
but if you could find a way to prevent some of it, and I'm not sure what it would be.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It would be money better spent than,#Other
do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard?#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
That's true.#Statement-opinion
I'm sure it is,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Statistically, that's true.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't, I don't,#Uninterpretable
certainly capital punishment isn't#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
going to solve a lot of problems#Other
but,#Uninterpretable
Are you for it?#Yes-No-Question
Uh,#Uninterpretable
I'm for it in#Statement-non-opinion
I guess I am#Statement-non-opinion
in some cases.#Other
for certain cri-,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Agree/Accept
in certain crimes.#Statement-non-opinion
What kind of crimes would you d-, use it for?#Wh-Question
Uh, premeditated murder.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Response Acknowledgement
Crimes of that nature, I think should definitely,#Other
any mass murderer type individual.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I would consider it for sexual abuse of children, on going.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
You know, not one instance, but perpetual abusers of children.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you always have castration#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you know, somebody elected that recently.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I read about that#Statement-non-opinion
And all the civil rights people are up in arms about it, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh,#Uninterpretable

Why don't you go ahead and start.#Action-directive
Okay.#Agree/Accept
Well I think the court systems could stand some improvement.#Statement-opinion
Uh, trial by jury is good#Statement-opinion
but a lot of time i-, a lot of cases, uh, is circumstantial evidence that, that convicts a person, which I don't think is all the time good. Because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent, I mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness.#Statement-opinion
And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me.#Rhetorical-Questions
I don't know.#Hedge
So you think if, if trials were held by judges or experts, that they, they would tend not to, uh, admit, not to convict people on circumstantial evidence?#Yes-No-Question
I think so.#Affirmative non-yes answers
You know, I, I attended a trial in, uh, Germany when I was a student#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's the sort of system they have.#Other
The trials are held by a panel of three, uh, three or four judges who are, well,#Statement-non-opinion
they're like lawyers I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
They're experts in the law#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, there, there really isn't a jury#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, uh, they do the questioning also.#Statement-non-opinion
The judges do the questioning#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they,#Other
uh, i-,#Uninterpretable
I think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they, uh, uh, the judge is also sort of a jury, uh,#Statement-opinion
but I'm not sure I like that#Statement-non-opinion
I think I prefer the jury system myself.#Statement-non-opinion
You think you prefer the jury?#Yes-No-Question
You think your chances are better?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, well, actually I think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury#Dispreferred answers
What, what I worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual.#Statement-non-opinion
That's where you really need a jury of peers.#Statement-opinion
Well, that's true.#Agree/Accept
Because, uh, anytime th-, the government, uh, is the government against the individual you need som-, y-, you need the protection of ordinary citizens.#Other
I think that's really the only thing. I guess where I would like to see the system change is, uh, uh, there ought to be a, a well#Statement-opinion
I guess I don't think that, uh, uh, juries need to decide sentencing all the time.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think maybe th-, a judge is a better judge of that#Statement-opinion
or, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, s-, sometimes the sentencing is still, is not fair.#Statement-opinion
I mean even if, well the jury, I guess they do decide that#Statement-opinion
but, but, I'm like you,#Statement-non-opinion
in a case like that, most of the time its,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
maybe I'm too, too, uh, uh, conservative when it comes to that.#Statement-opinion
Th-, the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, uh,#Other
Well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent.#Statement-non-opinion
That's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But people who d-, don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are, to ask them to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see, I think that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In Texas here, people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, it's kind of, uh, uh, a hanging jury atmosphere#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But in a lot of places, I think people bend over the other way,#Statement-opinion
but I guess, I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it.#Statement-non-opinion
Some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really?#Backchannel in question form
I kind of like that system.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Repeat-phrase
That's, that's not a bad system.#Appreciation
But I, I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, the thing is too, maybe they need more of a, I don't know, more of a expert types#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
an-, and call them in.#Other
And lawyers blow sand in their eyes.#Statement-opinion
exactly.#Agree/Accept
I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
Insurance cases and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Where#Uninterpretable
and, uh, there would be more honest settlements instead of this, uh, tugging of people's heart strings and, uh#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them#Other
Put-, putting on a act or whatever. *#Other
or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering#Other
Uh-huh#Agree/Accept
Exactly#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
So. In, I think, i-, in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable

Okay,#Other
well, you,#Uninterpretable
Do you have any pets?#Yes-No-Question
Um, we got two cats.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Two cats.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, um,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
we had cat, you know, my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my Mom developed an allergies,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, I mean, I'm used, I'm used to having cats around,#Statement-non-opinion
I like them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like having ca-, cats around or pets around in general#Statement-non-opinion
I, I favor dogs over cats actually#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Oh, see, I'm not, uh, I'm not a dog person at all#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I'm, I'm a dog person.#Statement-non-opinion
I had,#Uninterpretable
I guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid, right?#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
probably,#Agree/Accept
I was allergic to dogs when I was a kid,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in fact,#Other
I may still be,#Statement-non-opinion
um, we,#Uninterpretable
But not cats.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
That , um,#Uninterpretable
I wonder sometimes#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, but we, um, we house sat for a, um, my, um, my wife's boss a couple weeks ago#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, uh, he has a dog and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
we were, you know, we were sitting the dog and everything#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I felt like just miserable all weekend#Statement-non-opinion
and it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday,#Statement-non-opinion
it was like, hey, maybe you're still allergic to the dog.#Statement-non-opinion
It was like, oh, that could be it.#Statement-non-opinion
The thing I don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of the dogs, and constantly .#Other
Well, dogs are real high maintenances,#Statement-opinion
you got to take them for walks#Statement-opinion
and you've got to pay a lot, you know,#Statement-opinion
you need to pay attention to cats and everything#Statement-opinion
but it's not quite the same thing.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
Um, and, um, um, you know, it's, it's just nice that cats, you know, cats, yeah, you don't have to let them outside, you know,#Statement-opinion
all cats are indoor cats,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, you know, they're not, yo-, w-, you're not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood#Statement-opinion
and, you know, they, you know, they, they make their mess in the cat pan which is,#Statement-opinion
Limited.#Collaborative Completion
yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's, you know, it's a pain to clean#Statement-opinion
but, you know, we used to,#Uninterpretable
I mean, they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans .#Statement-opinion
They didn't,#Uninterpretable
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Well, when I was, you know, when I was growing up I had a clean the cat pan all the time,#Statement-non-opinion
and I hated it because I had to carry everything upstairs and, you know, and use this thing to, you know, scoop the, take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything#Statement-non-opinion
it was really terrible.#Statement-non-opinion
But now they have like this, you get these liners,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that is garbage bags, you know,#Other
and you, and you, you know the,#Uninterpretable
Oh, that sounds so easy, what I did,#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
the cats do it in there,#Statement-non-opinion
you pull it and take it out and throw it away,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's it,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I housesat from cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and what we used to do was just put, um, newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter#Statement-non-opinion
and then I would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Same idea#Statement-opinion
Then I would do it, you know, everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very, very rarely,#Statement-non-opinion
Everyday?#Yes-No-Question
and so it wasn't so bad.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
two cats and just as easy#Uninterpretable
it just never started smelling,#Statement-non-opinion
I would put just a little bit of cat litter in there,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because if I put a lot, one of the cats would have been,#Other
all of her animals that she ever had were adopted.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I that true,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
she's even got, she's got one dog now and the two cats#Statement-non-opinion
and her dog there is, is basically a reject,#Statement-non-opinion
somebody had bought him,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and wanted him.#Other
It was her ex boyfriend and, you know, just was not mature enough to keep the dog, didn't realize how much work it was#Statement-non-opinion
and now,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she's stuck with it.#Other
And she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals#Statement-non-opinion
but I think that for me, well, my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
because that's all there is to it.#Statement-non-opinion
So, you know,#Uninterpretable
So, you don't have anything right now?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
we don't have anything right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, except the kid,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
huh, that's ,#Uninterpretable
Oh, right,#Affirmative non-yes answers
now we have a kid#Statement-non-opinion
but he was, no, completely against having a dog or cat,#Statement-non-opinion
he said, they're much, they're as much work as a kid,#Statement-non-opinion
and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend,#Quotation
And,#Uninterpretable
Uh, I don't, I don't know because the cats pretty much, um,#Statement-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, uh, it's not a big deal really,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean they're, they're happier when we're around#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, they, they're pretty much okay by themselves,#Statement-non-opinion
um, and I don't, you know, we couldn't do that with a dog.#Statement-opinion
That's, uh, yeah, really true.#Agree/Accept
But like the friends, other friends of mine have cats,#Statement-non-opinion
they have four of them,#Statement-non-opinion
and if they go away, they have, they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that#Statement-non-opinion
and their cats, you know, they're so used to the attention, that if they don't get it, they get really upset,#Statement-non-opinion
Well , that's,#Statement-opinion
and, you know, they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
That's, um, pampering the, the petals#Other
I, I tried to have, um, figured something having,#Statement-non-opinion
so I tried to have a goldfish,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, I killed that one within a very short amount of time.#Statement-non-opinion
But they're not that much fun, you know,#Statement-opinion
you can't take them for a walk,#Statement-opinion
you can't, you know,#Statement-opinion
they, they don't, they can't fetch, you know,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they ca-, they can't do anything,#Statement-opinion
so I've never,#Uninterpretable
I think we had fish sh-, when I was a kid#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't,#Uninterpretable
My brother had fish when I was a kid#Statement-non-opinion
I remember that,#Statement-non-opinion
and one of his fish jumped out of the, um, gosh, what do you call it, fish tank. And fried itself, on the radiator behind the dresser.#Statement-non-opinion
I'll never forget that#Statement-non-opinion
because I remember my brother,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he came home and he counted the fish#Other
and one of the fish was missing#Statement-non-opinion
and they couldn't find it anyplace,#Statement-non-opinion
they couldn't figure out what had happened#Statement-non-opinion
and then they found it fried on, the radiator behind.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was not gross,#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't see it#Statement-non-opinion
but, um,#Uninterpretable
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
got them.#Other
Trying to remember we had a dog for a while,#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't know if we got rid of the dog#Statement-non-opinion
because my brother was allergic to it,#Statement-non-opinion
my brother had asthma and some allergies which I think he's outgrown now,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards#Statement-non-opinion
and then he had fish.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you,#Uninterpretable
they're, like you say, they're not the most exciting pet to have.#Agree/Accept
No,#Agree/Accept
it's like,#Uninterpretable
I just, I don't know,#Hedge
I, I just never understood why, what the attraction,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, they're, you know, they're pretty and everything#Statement-non-opinion
but I've just never s-, seen the attraction of having fish.#Statement-non-opinion
It's not as much fun.#Statement-opinion
Well, a friend of mine had, um, an eel,#Statement-non-opinion
an eel?#Backchannel in question form
and then he had a, um,#Uninterpretable
I forget what type of fish it was,#Hold before answer/agreement
it was one of these fish that i-, it would eat, it ate a big other fish and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
There would be sort of moby fish in a tank.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, now we really get sick#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it,#Uninterpretable
I, I couldn't see having fish like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I could see some having, maybe some of the tropical fish, that are really, really pretty#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Like, I remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, you know, used to drop mice in#Other
this is not, these aren't cats, you know,#Statement-non-opinion

this is gross.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
no,#Reject
that would be,#Uninterpretable
what did they do, everyone come around and watch them.#Yes-No-Question

I mean, I guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well,#Uninterpretable
and your things destroyed the mice.#Other
But,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, a cat will do the same trick#Statement-opinion
Let's see ,#Hold before answer/agreement
I had a pet rat, for a while,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and it was a live rat,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, this woman just offered it to me while I was in, in graduate school#Statement-non-opinion

I had a friend in col-,#Statement-non-opinion
she was actually a very fun pet.#Other
I had a friend in college who had a, um, had a pet rat for a while.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I forget how she got it,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was, um, it was the same kind of a deal#Statement-non-opinion
I think she got it,#Statement-non-opinion
I think she was a psych major#Statement-non-opinion
and she got it from the psych department.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah ,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
mine had been a, a, a#Statement-non-opinion
how did this work,#Self-talk
a mill rat had been bought#Statement-non-opinion
and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said, you know, this rat is acting really strange I think he's sick,#Statement-non-opinion
and she said, I don't think he's sick, I think she's pregnant,#Statement-non-opinion
Whoops#Appreciation
And they had misclassed the sex of back there#Statement-non-opinion
and so, um, she asked me if I want to, one of those babies,#Statement-non-opinion
and I took the baby#Statement-non-opinion
and I got her when she was, you know, just this tiniest little thing like,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
half the price of a mouse,#Other
and then she grew to be, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand#Statement-non-opinion
and then she grew to be pretty big,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, like a pound or something#Other
I don't know how much,#Statement-non-opinion
and I had her for over two years#Statement-non-opinion
and she was very affectionate.#Statement-non-opinion
She would, you know, crawl on me#Statement-non-opinion
and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while I was working,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and things like that. Yeah, much more than you would think.#Other
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you know, if you get them young and everything before they go, kind of nuts,#Statement-opinion
so .#Uninterpretable
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
rats are not my favorite animals in the world,#Statement-non-opinion
but I could see getting one from birth and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, sort of weird for me to have had one too#Statement-non-opinion
but there,#Uninterpretable
it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, it was easy.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Easy to take care of#Other
and but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I, I have friends with hamsters and gerbils#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they tell me the same thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just,#Uninterpretable
again it gets into vivant much fun, you know what, I guess they can be.#Statement-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
Actually it was more fun than you would think. Yeah, starting from the beginning#Statement-opinion
but, um,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
we live, also live in the city now, actually in Manhattan.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so it's almost impossible to,#Statement-non-opinion

Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or certainly, certainly not a dog,#Other
I mean, people do,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh people,#Uninterpretable
but it's not,#Uninterpretable

plus, I mean, the pooper scooper one New York,#Statement-opinion

Yeah, uh ,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was living in northern Jersey when that law came through, remember hearing all about it,#Statement-non-opinion

we were wondering if they, uh, they had any special law for the horses in Central Park.#Declarative Yes-No-Question

no,#No answers
they don't.#Statement-non-opinion
I should make you ,#Uninterpretable

they have, um, the bags behind them#Statement-non-opinion
but I think they're actually supposed to,#Statement-opinion

keep them, yeah, keep them clean#Other

just the smell is so bad#Statement-non-opinion

so I wear a lot of blue jeans,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But occasionally I have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and high heel shoes#Other
and I feel really uncomfortable doing that#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the plant so, uh, it's, it's a problem for me.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, normally I just wear blue jeans and a T-shirt.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Very, very, comfortable.#Statement-non-opinion
I like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept

and buying suits and stuff, yeah, because just being at home#Summarize/reformulate
and, I work at home,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just have, you know, I just wear my, you know, my shorts and stuff like that.#Other
I don't go out and spend lots of money on, uh, different, you know, suits and stuff, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But when I,#Statement-non-opinion
before I got married, you know, I was working#Statement-non-opinion
so I, uh, you know, I had more suits and stuff then#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Worry about all that kind of stuff#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I have plenty of suits and dress clothes because I'm like you, when I first started working,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match, and that kind of stuff#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but now that I, you know, work in the manufacturing plant, then it's just, it's so much more difficult for me to, to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but occasionally I have to because, uh, part of my job is teaching,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and training,#Other
and, uh, so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal,#Statement-non-opinion
When you're training, right.#Summarize/reformulate
garb#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Than your normal garb#Statement-non-opinion
But I'm like you, too, uh, I moved from Ohio down to here#Statement-non-opinion

moved from,#Summarize/reformulate
and I had mostly polyesters and,#Statement-non-opinion
Winter.#Other
wools and winter clothes#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and buying all these cotton clothes,#Other
and then, of course, you have to iron them all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's really,#Uninterpretable
that's been a problem for me.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
because I came from Wyoming#Statement-non-opinion
and I had wool suits and wool skirts#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
You know, I've got all these clothes that I never wear,#Other

And, uh, the seasons are just so much different.#Statement-non-opinion
You have so much summer.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, so then when I, you know, I finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear#Statement-non-opinion
That's true, that's true.#Agree/Accept
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I know, I was just now, uh, uh, putting away a lot of my winter clothes,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I was going through here#Statement-non-opinion
and I was thinking, I haven't worn this in three years.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, because it's a wool skirt#Statement-non-opinion
and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I have five or six wool skirts,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I was thinking well, maybe, you know, I need to think about getting rid of them,#Statement-non-opinion
but no, I folded it up neatly and put it away maybe next year#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
You hate to get rid of it, because you know how much you spent on them.#Summarize/reformulate
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
And it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff, I know.#Statement-non-opinion
I know, I agree with you * 2 slash units?#Agree/Accept
So,#Uninterpretable
Well, I know last year, uh, well, this past winter, it wasn't that cold.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But the previous winter we had more, uh, cold weather where I was able to actually wear,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
your double and triple layerings of, uh, clothes#Other
Clothes,#Repeat-phrase

that's really interesting.#Other

and I, I just don't spend, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
right now my clothes come from Target, you know#Statement-non-opinion

and they're all one hundred percent cotton#Statement-non-opinion

and they're wadded up in a ball.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes,#Agree/Accept
I know.#Statement-non-opinion
So I, uh, I have my ironing board sitting out all the time, * Looks like this should be the end of a slash unit, not continue in B's next turn#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I never put mine away * See note above#Other
I'm so glad to meet somebody that, that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house.#Statement-non-opinion
It is, it is.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I have very little furniture,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but my ironing board is part of my decor#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
That's true,#Agree/Accept
and, and I've been looking at these, uh, uh, like in Home Depot where you can go and they've got, that ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the uh, uh, what, the, the, the door.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
and then you can ha-, actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall, you know, to have it,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
permanently attached,#Other
and that's what I'm thinking I'm going to have to do because mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with all the,#Other

Uh-uh,#Agree/Accept
uh-uh.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No.#Other
I've been thinking about putting the ironing board in the closet,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and running, you know, a line in there for my iron so I could do it in there#Other
and I wouldn't have to have that eyesore#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's an idea.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I have a big closet.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, you know,#Uninterpretable
if I have,#Uninterpretable
if I know I'm having somebody come over to the house and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I will put it away,#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
but I iron our clothes as we go along,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, you know,#Uninterpretable
I no longer do that weekly thing,#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
no.#Agree/Accept
because I have so many,#Other
and I'm like you,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, the night before or that day, I will iron whatever it is that we need#Other
and that's it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because it's too many,#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
You can't iron it all#Summarize/reformulate
and,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then with my kids, they're always getting into, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
they can't decide what they want to wear so they,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
change their minds, you know, I know, I mean my oldest is only four,#Other
but she's still changes her mind two or three times,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
before she figures out what she's going to wear#Other
so,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Agree/Accept
Oh, I know, I know.#Agree/Accept
And then they never put anything back.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
no#Agree/Accept
of course not.#Agree/Accept
No,#Agree/Accept
that, uh, that would be too simple.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

that, that, that's called smart, you know, they don't, we don't do that kind of stuff, you know. * Seems this should end in a slash#Statement-opinion

That's called too easy on mom. * See note above; this would seem to be an indep. slash unit#Other

well that's,#Uninterpretable
it's been good talking to you, to see somebody, hear somebody that does the same thing I do because I tell people what I do#Statement-non-opinion

but, yeah,#Uninterpretable
I, uh, I know several of my girlfriends, though, we, uh, we all keep our ironing boards out and just, uh, an ever present thing in our household#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't think I'd know what to do if it wasn't there, you know.#Statement-non-opinion

My husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes.#Statement-non-opinion

You know.#Other
Things that need to be mended,#Statement-non-opinion

things that have to get ironed,#Other

uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
That's true.#Agree/Accept
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Uh, generally I get, uh, you know, most of my news, uh, in the, you know, weekly magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK and, and, uh, U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. With, with occasional smatterings of, of, uh, you know, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and, of course, the local paper.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, my, my only complaint is I really don't enough time to, to look at the articles every day and, and go through a paper, you know, exhaust the details.#Statement-non-opinion
So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like?#Yes-No-Question
Well, yes.#Yes answers
I, I, well, I, I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and so I, I, I like the weekly magazines, uh, because i-, it gives me, you know, the high points of what's going on.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but many times, uh, you know, the, the local, uh, the local news kind of suffers, you know.#Statement-opinion
But here I am, you know, cheek by jowl with our nation's capital#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Oh, that's right.#Appreciation
You're very close actually.#Statement-non-opinion
It's#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
almost a, uh, bedroom community for#Other
Yes.#Agree/Accept
the capital.#Other
E-, exactly.#Agree/Accept
Well, when, when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway, I'm saying to myself, hey guys, I'm inside the beltway#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But, uh, i-, it turns out that, uh, that, that the C N N is, I think, is great.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And for, for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events#Other
but generally, they're, they're, they're more sound bitish, you know, kind of thing#Statement-opinion
and, and I don't really,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
uh, you know, I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient, uh, you know, dose of news that way.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A lot of my information comes from several sources.#Statement-non-opinion
Probably pretty high up on the list is National Public Radio.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, which I like.#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I, I think it's fairly objective#Statement-opinion
and I always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative.#Statement-non-opinion
And while there's an inherent, uh, filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read, uh, I always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of, uh, favoring the other side.#Statement-opinion
That's, that's potential indication of balance.#Statement-opinion
And, generally, I really do believe they are pretty balanced.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I also read TIME magazine#Statement-non-opinion
and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the, uh, various, uh, of the articles and the front section#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well the MERCURY and the, and the, and the CHRONICLE are the only things that are really, can#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
stand up there.#Other
Oh, you st-,#Uninterpretable

I know exactly where that is.#Statement-non-opinion
Anteks, Amdahl and places like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we, we get the MERCURY which I generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A-,#Uninterpretable
the newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at times, i-, at, well the LOS ANGELES TIMES.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which I've found to be a, uh a very good quality uh, newspaper#Other
and I like a lot of the articles there.#Statement-non-opinion
Th-, the other thing when you said, we don't have cable T V, so but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is, is called C SPAN.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
I, I've, I enjoy,#Statement-non-opinion
see they have, uh, we have two, the, both C SPANS here.#Statement-non-opinion
But, but#Statement-non-opinion
Both?#Signal-non-understanding

I, I like a, I saw the, uh, the, uh, the, the tapes that were, that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust#Statement-non-opinion
was, the whole thing was, was run on that#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I never say that. *#Statement-non-opinion
That would have been interesting.#Statement-opinion
and, and a-, also, they have the, uh, the, uh, uh, PARLIAMENT'S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD.#Other
It,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I think that's always fascinating.#Statement-opinion
I wish, I wish we had something.#Statement-non-opinion
when, wh-, when it first, uh, you know, when it first tuned in on that I, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it's one that's,#Uninterpretable
I think it was, somebody was just scarcely just, just ripping the hell out of someo-, another person.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And I,#Uninterpretable
and everybody was, you know, making noise in the background.#Statement-non-opinion
And then, *#Other
But it's usually the Prime Minister,#Statement-opinion

Yeah.#Other
Here's this dude in a wig#Statement-non-opinion

And then, and then up jumps Margaret Thatcher off her green bench#Statement-non-opinion
and I said oh, it's Parliament#Statement-non-opinion
Which could be another of Monty Python.#Statement-opinion

So I, I thought to myself, I can't wait.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm going over to, to Britain in mid, you know, in mid-May.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I, I'm going to, uh, you know, a-, you know, apr-, approach my, uh, you know,#Uninterpretable
this is how I discovered, you know, the que-, the Prime Minister's, you know, question and answer period, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
P-,#Uninterpretable
I, I have seen that#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, a, aside from the level of wit which is much higher than, generally, in American politics, uh, which I really enjoy. I really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard, real questions I think.#Statement-opinion
And it's unlike the fairly controlled, uh, press conferences that Presidents of the United States have here where they, they always seem,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Okay#Other
what kind of#Wh-Question
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Oh, I do too#Statement-non-opinion

in fact that's what we had for a Christmas party last week.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We just had a bunch of people over#Statement-non-opinion

Oh, yeah,#Appreciation
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And have, you know, like three or four couples come over,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'll do the potatoes and you know, like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings, whatever they like#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it turns out great, because#Statement-non-opinion

that's fun.#Statement-opinion
I mean, you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and, you know, bacon and all that good stuff.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it's, it's inexpensive#Statement-non-opinion

plus it's real easy on the hostess, because you can just have the potatoes ready, and just have a salad with it,#Statement-non-opinion
and you got a great dinner.#Statement-non-opinion

that's a good idea.#Statement-opinion
It's, it's real easy,#Statement-non-opinion
I like doing that part.#Statement-non-opinion

I'm in favor of very little clean up, um, very#Statement-non-opinion

Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

and it just.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how neat.#Appreciation
It fluffs up,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's really moist.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
Now I've done it with, where you put, you cook the ri-, well, I guess you probably could do it same way, but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup, and put a little bit of white wine in it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
wow,#Appreciation
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And every once in a while, I'll put in, I'll slice white grapes#Statement-non-opinion
and I'll put in there,#Statement-non-opinion
and, that's just because I'm not a real big wine person#Statement-non-opinion
but I like it,#Statement-non-opinion
it#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
adds something to the chicken.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then just bake it,#Statement-non-opinion
and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I'll keep that one in mind.#Offers, Options Commits
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, that was one of the first things I made for my husband, because I was like, um,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I could actually find something I could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
kind of#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you can get away with it#Summarize/reformulate
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
even having a semi nice dinner,#Other
or, you know semi .#Statement-opinion
But then, I hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, just, like in a thirteen by nine pan.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
You put in, um#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
let's see, what was it, three quarters of cup of rice#Statement-non-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable
Um.#Uninterpretable
It depends on,#Statement-non-opinion
you can really vary it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But you have to put the water in proportionally.#Statement-non-opinion
I can't remember.#Hedge
I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water, two cups, um, broth.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I use that for br-, for rice#Statement-non-opinion
and for when I cook pasta or something, I'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
flavor.#Collaborative Completion
give it a little extra flavor.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um. Now that would be good.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How long do you have to bake it?#Wh-Question
Um, let's see.#Hold before answer/agreement
I think it was an hour.#Statement-non-opinion
I've done it in the microwave so often lately because, it's, it's really easy.#Statement-non-opinion
I do, I do microwave too, a lot#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I think it's about an hour.#Statement-non-opinion
How long would it be#Wh-Question
Or maybe it's only half hour.#Statement-non-opinion
how long would it be in the microwave?#Other
Um, you just,#Uninterpretable
until the rice looks fluffy, and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
and not overdone.#Other
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, before it gets overdone.#Other
Do you just brown the chicken to get it colored#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
or do you go ahead and let it cook through?#Or-Clause
Um, I'd let it cook just a little bit#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
just so that the cooking goes a little faster.#Other
Ooh, this is a beneficial call.#Statement-opinion
I like this#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I liked your idea too, there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but that one's an easy one.#Statement-non-opinion
It's like, just put in,#Statement-non-opinion
a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the, with the soup and the wine#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
put in garlic and onion powder#Action-directive
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or chopped onions if you want to do that, you know. What ever, however much effort you feel like putting into it.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it, it makes a great,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I've got a two year old and a four year old#Statement-non-opinion
and they love it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, because my daughter calls it her gravy#Statement-non-opinion

she thinks it's wonderful,#Other
my, good, you're a picky eater, if I can get you to,#Quotation

Okay,#Other

Oh, uh, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
I, uh, I have enjoyed, uh, THIRTYSOMETHING#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the past, uh, now that it has gone off#Other

Uh, some comedy shows, uh, I can not, can not think of, off hand,#Statement-non-opinion

but, what, what are your,#Wh-Question
what is,#Wh-Question
We do not watch a lot of T V,#Statement-non-opinion
we try to watch it on Thursday nights,#Statement-non-opinion
we usually watch L A LAW,#Statement-non-opinion
I like that real well.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And CHEERS#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we like to watch that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, we sort of got hooked on LA LAW.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, do you ever watch that?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
uh, yeah,#Yes answers
yeah,#Yes answers
we, we wa-, we try to catch that most, most nights.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I, I have watched THIRTYSOMETHING some in the last couple seasons.#Statement-non-opinion
I was sort of sorry to see it go#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
too.#Other
It, it was kind of interesting, uh, some people complained about, uh, uh, the kind of whining or whatever on it.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I really did not think it, it was,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that way.#Other
I think it had some, some good, uh, good situations that it presented.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I thought a lot of the,#Statement-non-opinion
like the problems that Michael and Hope had in their marriage and stuff, I can relate to some of those things.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just the dynamics of it and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I think, I think a lot of people, you know, kind of felt that way,#Statement-opinion
but they had a lot of, uh, uh, counseling groups that use some of the episodes as,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as examples of things that were going on#Other
and, and uh, yo-, you know, that they called interaction between people and sort of to use as, uh, as a way of getting people to talk about their problems,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that sort of thing#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, we kind of,#Uninterpretable
uh, our T V viewing has, uh, slowed down a little bit since our our daughter came along,#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, that tends to, uh, put a cramp in your viewing, because by the time you get through getting her ready for bed and everything, uh, it's, uh, very little T V time left.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you are too tired#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to do anything.#Other
Oh, it's better to spend time with your kids, I think though, than glued in front of the T V anyway.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
Probably more worthwhile.#Statement-opinion
I just don't, I don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be, really.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
I, I can not, uh, *#Statement-non-opinion
I don't think there were, Uh,#Statement-opinion
I have not, I have not, uh, uh, there are not as many good shows that I, that I continuously like to watch as much as I used to#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh, you know, ther-,#Uninterpretable
I, uh, I used to could be able to name ten shows or so, you know, that I felt were worth my time to watch,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I uh, you know very seldom like to watch you know those,#Statement-non-opinion
there's a couple now that I tend to want to watch.#Statement-non-opinion
I like, uh, home improvement shows like Bob Vela's, uh, HOME AGAIN on Saturday morning,#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, I notice it's like, it's like THIS OLD HOUSE,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah#Uninterpretable
but it's, uh, it's on#Uninterpretable
instead of being on pub-, P B S it's on regular T V.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, it's, uh, it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have seen parts of that before,#Statement-non-opinion
it is interesting.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
so I like to watch that#Statement-non-opinion
and uh, some, some things on P B S I like to watch#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh.#Uninterpretable
Do you watch sports much on T V?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
if it's someb-, if it's a team or something that I am really interested in I am not one to just watch a football game just, just to be watching it#Statement-non-opinion
or,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or I am not a big basketball or baseball fan, if it, unless it's baseball, if it's some, if it's a team I really like, I may watch#Other
but, uh, baseball to me is a little hard to watch on T V,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for an extended period.#Other
It's slow.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's so slow that you just get bored, you know,#Summarize/reformulate
I, I will switch between something else and, and a baseball game going back and forth, you know watching it.#Statement-non-opinion
But, I usually,#Uninterpretable
if, if, if it's a football team I really like, a college team or, or pro team that I am fond of, I usually will sit and watch that.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, that's the#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
we are like that#Statement-non-opinion
and occasionally we will, like on, if we do not have anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or something,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
we will watch a little bit of a golf tournament.#Other
But, uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you can not take a whole lot of that either,#Other
it's pretty slow.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's kind of like,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like baseball#Other
Do you wa-,#Uninterpretable
we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home, because there's just,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
on Friday and Saturday nights there's nothing good on#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Agree/Accept
I think that that's what more people are doing#Statement-opinion
and I think that's, you know,#Statement-opinion
as, as T V,#Uninterpretable
I think the less good shows being on T V has caused a lot of people to do, to do that, uh, you know, get more movies and watch.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know we, we have done that too in the past, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
we do not do it quite as much now, cause our baby will not let us watch them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, you know, we usually will, we used to rent, uh, two or three movies on a weekend and, and try to watch.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you have cable T V?#Yes-No-Question
No, uh,#No answers
We do not either.#Statement-non-opinion
we live in,#Statement-non-opinion
I thought we were the only ones#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
who did not have it.#Other
No,#Agree/Accept
we, uh,#Uninterpretable
the, uh, development we moved into was,#Statement-non-opinion
they have it on one si-, like right across the street from us,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but when they built our section they did not, did not put it in#Statement-non-opinion
and we have been there about two years now.#Statement-non-opinion
Gosh.#Appreciation
and they are still, still do not have it#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I am hoping that, that soon they will, they will,#Other
I have contacted them about this#Statement-non-opinion
and they say that well, it's, it's,#Statement-non-opinion
they look,#Uninterpretable
they, every year they look at, uh, different areas and try to determine where, where, uh, the most houses will be,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so they, uh, they look#Statement-non-opinion
and they, when they, when we reach a certain number of people in that area they will put one in, put,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
some in, or they will at,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
least consider it,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, we had it for awhile#Statement-non-opinion
and it just seemed like we never watched it#Statement-non-opinion
any we did not have the movie channels,#Statement-non-opinion
we just had all the normal ones,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that come#Other
and we just never watched any of them,#Statement-non-opinion
we kept a log for a month of every time we watched it#Statement-non-opinion
and it seemed like we did not watch even half an hour,#Statement-non-opinion
Um. Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so we decided to just cancel it.#Statement-non-opinion
It does improve the reception a little bit though,#Statement-non-opinion
that's the only thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I have, I put some, put in some, uh, an antenna, a really good antenna#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it's really helped, you know, ours#Statement-non-opinion
and it's not been too bad.#Statement-non-opinion
I have not really missed it that much,#Statement-non-opinion
there's certain things that I have, that I want to see, you know, occasionally, like a football game, a college game or something that happens to be on cable, or some old movie,#Statement-non-opinion
but the, uh,#Uninterpretable
I, I have not been bothered by it too much.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
Well, I can not, uh, think of too much else to say. *#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Since we are not big watchers.#Other
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, it was nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Alright,#Conventional-closing
bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay,#Other
is, uh, that a sport you like to participate in?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
Actually I'm a spectator,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm a second hand spectator as a result of my first husband's, or my late husband's, interest in golf.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My husband likes golf also,#Statement-non-opinion
he's, uh, I guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But he, he limits it pretty good.#Statement-non-opinion
I, um, have tried to go out and play golf.#Statement-non-opinion
He would love it if I would go out and play with him,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I stand there and swing and swing,#Other
and I can't even hit the ball#Statement-non-opinion
I can't even play miniature golf well.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't either#Statement-non-opinion
Well, there are just some things that we're good at and other things that we're not,#Statement-opinion
but I am very good at watching it on television.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he was really, uh, enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments.#Statement-non-opinion
He could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held, and what the nature of the hole was and,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, so he's really into it.#Summarize/reformulate
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
he was a good golfer.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
And as, and did some, you know, instructions at the country club for a while.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, golf tended to be so-,#Uninterpretable
I am not really deeply involved in any, following any of the sports.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But golf was one that I developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers,#Statement-non-opinion
and therefore I enjoyed following those particular players.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
more because of their personalities#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than their sportsman#Other
Well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship.#Dispreferred answers
Another part of it was I'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know, the competitor,#Other
and I became involved in following his career.#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I know that, that my husband,#Statement-non-opinion
Tom Kite was his fair haired boy.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he thought he was spectacular.#Statement-non-opinion
I said, Whoa.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not going to, I'm not going to stay interested in him.#Quotation
So I decided Andy Bean was good competition#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Any time they both played, why, he was just real excited when Tom was, you know, shown on the television,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and I followed Andy Bean.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We both followed Lee Trevino into the Seniors.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, he's interesting.#Statement-opinion
He is.#Agree/Accept
I like to watch him.#Statement-non-opinion
He is a character#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
not just a golfer,#Other
but he's quite a character.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And there are some really, really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think you're right.#Agree/Accept
And I think it's critical, it's critical to have a good role model#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in any field, any sports.#Other
I like to watch those skins games.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain amou-, you know,#Yes-No-Question
for each hole they win they get the money#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
for it.#Other
I think those are pretty exciting.#Statement-opinion
Well, I myself, really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf.#Statement-non-opinion
You hit a little ball,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you chase it,#Statement-opinion
you go find it,#Statement-opinion
and then you hit it again and lose it again.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
And I know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier.#Statement-opinion
Oh really#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
I sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I know.#Agree/Accept
and mad at themselves#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when they don't do well.#Other
My husband and his buddies are not very good.#Statement-non-opinion
They play like maybe once a month or less#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so they all hit like in the low nineties,#Statement-non-opinion
and they think they're having a really good game#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
Well, my husband's average ran in the mid seventies#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
so he wasn't bad.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that is good.#Appreciation
He was pretty good,#Statement-opinion
but as far as influencing young people, I think that that is, uh, that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age.#Statement-opinion
You can't play football at fifty-five.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it is a good healthy, wholesome lifestyle, uh,#Statement-opinion
anything can be warped.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to, to move into maturity#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
safely.#Other
Something to stay active at#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
for a long time.#Other
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And a lot of seniors, a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're, you know, in their later years.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and they can still get good at it.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's absolutely right.#Agree/Accept
And it's something that,#Uninterpretable
Well, maybe that's what I'll do when I have time later on,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when you're too old to do anything else#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
go play golf,#Other
yeah#Uninterpretable
But it's, it's also something that husband and wife can participate in#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or, you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles.#Statement-opinion
True.#Appreciation
You know, you can go to the country club together.#Statement-opinion
You can play with your friends,#Statement-opinion
he can play with his friends,#Statement-opinion
but you've both been out and exercised,#Statement-opinion
and you have enjoyed the day.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Or my favorite,#Statement-non-opinion
just ride around in the cart with him#Statement-opinion
You bet,#Appreciation
you get a lot of exercise that way.#Statement-opinion
Go somewhere really nice, like Hawaii, and just#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
well, I'll tell you what, if#Statement-opinion
look at the golf course.#Other
if they're not real good golfers, sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
But my husband's pretty tolerant,#Statement-non-opinion
so he's not too bad#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to watch.#Other
Oh, mine had a very short fuse.#Statement-non-opinion
If he did something bad, he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no,#Appreciation
yeah.#Uninterpretable
He's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, just get so mad, he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal.#Statement-non-opinion
Gosh.#Appreciation
Now my husband has a temper,#Statement-non-opinion
but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course.#Statement-non-opinion
He's, because he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and how immature he thought it was and stuff.#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I guess he's real laid back about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He, he'll come home though, and he'll shoot when he was shooting in the hundreds,#Statement-non-opinion
and he'll tell me what a great day he had, and about this great shot he made and everything .#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well I shot in the hundreds,#Quotation
but I made this one good one#Quotation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
this one, on this one hole#Quotation
.#Non-verbal
Did you have to listen to long stories about, now on the seventeenth hole I hit it and went this way#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
those are, it's hard for me to,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
act nice about that when it goes on and on,#Other
Well, one thing that is a, is a drawback about it, I think, is the cost.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Membership in the clubs is expensive,#Statement-opinion
the equipment is very expensive,#Statement-opinion
requires special shoes,#Statement-opinion
requires special, you know, special equipment.#Statement-opinion
There's so many,#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
and then they want to play another course that's not, they're not a member of#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
and other fees.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
It really is high.#Statement-opinion
It can get very expensive,#Agree/Accept
and I can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro, because you spend hours and hours and hours#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
practicing.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they don't give those sessions away.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And nor do they give, uh, instructions away.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
As a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if I thought I'd be interested in golf.#Statement-non-opinion
I said I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
I'll have to try it and see.#Quotation
I've always watched it.#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he said, well, fine,#Statement-non-opinion
he said, we'll just take you over to the course, he lives near Brookhaven#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it.#Other
If you do, then we can go golf together.#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, whoa,#Appreciation
great,#Appreciation
I get to walk all around a little green field all day.#Statement-non-opinion

But those kinds of things happen, though,#Statement-opinion
you, you get a little taste of it#Statement-opinion
and you say, Hey, this is not bad.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you really begin to develop an interest in it.#Statement-opinion
But I am not an athlete at all.#Statement-non-opinion
Me either.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball,#Statement-non-opinion

and, hu-, hu-, hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball.#Other

So I am not an athlete.#Statement-non-opinion
Maybe golf is a forgiving sport.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge

at least you're just com-,#Statement-opinion
It doesn't appear to be#Statement-opinion
you're competing against yourself, I guess, more than everybody else out there.#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
I really, I, I haven't really acquired an interest in it,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm open to try anything,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's,#Statement-non-opinion
you know.#Other
kind of the way I feel.#Other
The one thing that is also detrimental as far I'm concerned, my skin is very fair#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I'm going to have to golf in the evening#Statement-non-opinion

I remember when I was in college,#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't have time to do that stuff either.#Statement-non-opinion

I'll call ho-, like when I know my mom and dad aren't home, I'll call home just to talk to my little brothers and sisters.#Statement-non-opinion

It's maybe once a year or something#Statement-non-opinion

but now that I'm married and stuff I, you know I've like, I'm really bad.#Statement-non-opinion

Nobody would want me on their team.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm the, you know, I'm the opposing teams best player, so, so to speak,#Statement-non-opinion

You know, what reading I do, I kind of do because it's, you know, it's the necessary stuff#Other

I don't have a lot of time to read.#Statement-non-opinion

They, those have been real popular with my family.#Statement-non-opinion
I've had them calling up and saying, will you make me another one#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
so, I do things like that, you know,#Other
if I had more time, I'd probably do it and sell the stuff#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, I don't have enough time to do it to really, you know, take orders on it,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, it's like I can only do it when I have time.#Statement-non-opinion
I have a whole stack of material and patterns to sew up as it is,#Statement-non-opinion

Those are real popular,#Statement-opinion

yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
those are fun to do,#Statement-opinion
and just little things, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I didn't have a lot of,#Statement-non-opinion
when I was in college I did, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I did sewing for other people when I had time, you know,#Other
like if somebody needed a bridesmaids, maids dress made, I'd make that,#Statement-non-opinion
but that's about all the sewing I did,#Statement-non-opinion
I never had time for, you know, to sew myself a new dress or anything like that#Statement-non-opinion
so, but, yeah.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just kind of sew for my kids#Statement-non-opinion
and that's about it,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
Well, I guess maybe we've co-, covered the topic, pretty good.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I really don't have any other.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm not too much, uh, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't have a lot of hobbies,#Statement-non-opinion
mine are just mostly, you know things I just do out of necessity.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay,#Conventional-closing

It was nice talking to you too.#Conventional-closing
Good luck in school.#Conventional-closing
Thanks.#Conventional-closing
Bye, bye#Conventional-closing
Bye, bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay.#Other
Well, basically I am a mother of a three year old,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's, uh, extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child, uh, trust their emotional and their safety and#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
all the rest of that.#Other
And, uh, I've been pretty selective,#Statement-non-opinion
and what I'm finding is with, um, day cares that are like day care centers like, for instance, uh, Learning Tree or Kinder Care and all of that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What I find is that they're highly structured, highly organized. Almost too rigid for the children if you bring a child in at a certain time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, like nap time or whatever time, uh, because of parents' hours they are differ-,#Other
and when I bring my daughter into such a system like that, uh, they only have one thing going on#Statement-non-opinion
and that's nap time.#Statement-non-opinion
Everybody is napping,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whether they came there an hour before or they came a-, right during that time.#Other
And with that kind of a system my daughter just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on a cot.#Other
So, um, home day care has been an option.#Statement-non-opinion
And I've looked into that.#Statement-non-opinion
The only thing is you raise the question of if it's safe, uh, can you trust the people, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
Um,#Uninterpretable
And you never know.#Statement-opinion
I have, um, an ex-sister-in-law that,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, currently has a child abuse case on a home baby-sitter.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, sure.#Appreciation
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's really scary.#Appreciation
And,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
To the point that you kind of say to yourself, especially home day care#Other
I mean, I think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours, it's fine.#Other
It depends on the age of the child.#Statement-non-opinion
Now some children do real well that are at the age of four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while#Statement-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
home da-, home day care works well if it's an infant.#Other
If it's, if it's,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you want to have kind of like a family structuring where there's a home that they can be provided. Because I've seen things at the day care where they can't keep up with all the kids.#Other
The kids have,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
colds#Other
and they're sick all the time#Statement-non-opinion
and the-,#Uninterpretable

What do you think?#Open-Question
Well, uh, this is, this is about drug testing right?#Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Well, uh, I'm, I'm certainly under the, uh, uh, the influence of the idea that, that the government needs to have less control on what, uh, what the citizens do,#Statement-opinion
although I do see this as a, uh, something that definitely needs to be taken care of.#Statement-opinion
Whether that, whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or the, the hands of the, hands of the government is a, you know, a, a different question I think, as far as I'm concerned.#Statement-opinion
I-,#Uninterpretable
in, in other words, I am fa-, in favor of drug contro-, or, or, or drug testing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I was drug tested when I came to my job here at T I.#Statement-non-opinion
Yet#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, but at the same time, I don't think, uh, that should be governed by by the government, uh, per se.#Other
I think it should be more by the private institution.#Statement-opinion
How about you?#Open-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I think that the corporations should, uh, do all that.#Statement-opinion
They should, uh, have drug screening before they hire#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
an employee#Other
and, uh, any time that an employee,#Uninterpretable
like if they're coming to late work all the time and, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if they, if they're, especially if there's they're on the line or any kind of sensitive job where, you know, if they can, if they made a mistake, it would cost a lot of money or#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or people's lives. * slash#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Then they need to be watched carefully * slash#Other
so, *#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I agree with you.#Agree/Accept
I, you know, I would even think that, uh, uh, I could, in theory take that a l-, a, you know, a step further and say anybody in any job, you know, if the corporation felt like, uh, b-, b-,#Statement-opinion
and this is why, I mean, uh, drugs are the biggest problem, I think to face America today.#Statement-opinion
I mean i-, th-, it's what drives crime,#Statement-opinion
it's what drives, uh, uh, any sort of, of, uh, uh, pain and discomfort in the world, or in America I think is some-, is somewhat, uh, uh, driven by drugs#Statement-opinion
and I think that, uh, were corporations and, uh, private industry to take, uh, take command in this situation, that maybe, maybe we might have some, some control over that.#Statement-opinion
We, you know,#Uninterpretable
if you can't work, then you can't be a little bit harder to take, take drugs or whatever,#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
Right. *#Other
Course, that might up crime, you know, when, uh, people go in and steal your television and ste-, and sell it just because they can't, they can't work anymore, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but you got to have a, a safe work place.#Statement-opinion
That's all there is to it.#Statement-opinion
Definitely,#Agree/Accept
you, you're definitely right.#Agree/Accept
That, uh, you can't, you can't have it any other way.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you know, whether whether in, in the case that you brought up, you know, whether, uh, you know, w-,#Uninterpretable
if it's a policeman and he's working with, uh, the public and he has a, and has a gun in his holster or, or even, you know, if it's a guy at McDonald's cooking a burger, I think, they're dangerous in either situation.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I,#Uninterpretable
what, what do you think, uh,#Open-Question
what percentage of, of corporations and, uh, private industry do you think use, uh, drug testing?#Wh-Question
I think it's, it's more frequent now.#Statement-opinion
It's probably like forty, fifty percent.#Statement-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because, uh, all the jobs that I've applied for have, uh, mentioned some type of drug screening.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know. *#Other
What kind of work are you in?#Wh-Question
Uh, I work at Sears.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I just do warehouse work.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and did they give you drug testing?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, not,#Negative non-no answers
they hired me in nineteen eighty-four#Statement-non-opinion
so, *#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah. *#Other
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
But now they, they, uh, they issued a statement#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
about that, about three months ago.#Other
Oh, so are they going to, uh, begin spontaneous, uh, drug testing?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, not that I know of.#Negative non-no answers
It was more about, uh, all the people's problems.#Statement-non-opinion
Like#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they've been laying off a lot of people.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, and, uh, they sent out the employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Family problems, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They kind of covered everything.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I know they have a lot of drug problems#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What do you think about, uh, you know,#Open-Question
something that kind of concerns me is, uh, y-, you know, you and I are tested for, for whatever work we happen to do.#Statement-opinion
Do you think there should be drug testing for political officials?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I do, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Because, because a lot of them are, you know, they're hypocritical.#Statement-opinion
They, they talk against drugs#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then they get caught, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In stings in Washington. *#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Whether it's drugs or any other kind of, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
like the, the money laundering scams. All that was drug related.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, and that cost us, the country, you know, billions of dollars.#Statement-opinion
Sure,#Agree/Accept
sure,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
So,#Uninterpretable
I would agree with you.#Agree/Accept
I, I can't see, I can't see how we can expect the, you know, uh, uh, people working in the, in, in America to, uh, to put any trust into our political officials if they don't, you know, uh,#Statement-opinion
just doesn't make sense to have them i-, to, to worry about legislation unless they're doing that themselves.#Statement-opinion

.#Non-verbal
So, what sort of car are you interested in getting next?#Wh-Question
Well, actually, I love the car I have.#Statement-non-opinion
I have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible.#Statement-non-opinion
And#Statement-non-opinion
Ah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I love it.#Other
And I would get another one in a minute.#Statement-non-opinion
Unless I could afford what I really like which would be a red Ferrari or, you know, a little Corvette or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
And that's what would influence my decision to change because I like a really sporty car.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'd love an expensive one#Statement-non-opinion
but I probably,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
can never afford it#Other
so#Uninterpretable
Uh, well I understand and can sympathize with that because I also enjoy driving performance automobiles.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I currently have an eighty-seven, five liter Mustang G T#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that I've done a bunch of modifications to, to make it, uh, handle and perform better,#Other
.#Non-verbal
and I suspect if I were to be able to get another car where object was, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
the best car I could get regardless of money, uh, I probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I'm a nurse here#Statement-non-opinion
and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari.#Statement-non-opinion
A, a three twenty-eight G T S?#Yes-No-Question
And I couldn't tell you#Other answers
but it's just beautiful.#Statement-opinion
And I go out and I love to touch it#Statement-non-opinion
but I can't even do that because of the alarm.#Statement-non-opinion
You just go hunting?#Rhetorical-Questions
So, I just look at it a lot#Statement-non-opinion
Go out and lust after it.#Summarize/reformulate
Really#Agree/Accept
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
But it sure is a pretty thing#Statement-opinion
So have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
I'm working on it#Statement-non-opinion
No,#No answers
I really haven't,#Statement-non-opinion
no,#No answers
huh-uh#No answers
I did#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
test drive a Corvette last year. Maybe the year before.#Other
It was brand new, white,#Statement-non-opinion
it was like a big marshmallow.#Statement-opinion
When you sat in the seats, they adjusted to fit around you.#Statement-non-opinion
uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean they came in and up and out#Statement-non-opinion
and I mean, they did whatever#Statement-non-opinion
and, and we went for a test drive in that#Statement-non-opinion
and I was able to open that up pretty good#Statement-non-opinion
and that was really fun.#Statement-opinion
And I wanted it,#Statement-non-opinion
but I had a choice of that or my house#Statement-non-opinion
and I thought that I'd continue,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to live in my house#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there, there's something about having a place to live,#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you know, it's just necessary.#Statement-opinion
And I did, I thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical.#Statement-opinion
Could sleep in the back of the 'vette.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
I find that, uh, that the Corvettes are, are becoming really, really nice cars.#Statement-opinion
They are, they're pretty aren't they lately#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
And#Statement-opinion
They really are.#Statement-opinion
they, they've improved,#Other
.#Non-verbal
the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive.#Other
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's not like driving a, a Winnebago or something.#Statement-opinion
Oh, no#Agree/Accept
No,#Agree/Accept
no.#Agree/Accept
See, I'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now#Statement-non-opinion

Not really, you know.#Quotation
How about#Quotation
Nice.#Statement-non-opinion
a Greyhound bus#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Nice isn't the word I'd choose.#Statement-non-opinion
Maybe practical.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean that, you know.#Uninterpretable
Isn't that a practical van.#Yes-No-Question
There's some that are prettier than others#Statement-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
the new type is prettier than what their, they used to look like#Statement-opinion
but I sure don't think it's attractive, you know.#Statement-opinion
It's not like, like driving a little sports car.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It, it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I don't think that happens#Statement-opinion
so, but I, I love mine,#Statement-non-opinion
so, and I, I bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii#Statement-non-opinion
and I just went home#Statement-non-opinion
and I walked in#Statement-non-opinion
and I picked it out#Statement-non-opinion
and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to,#Statement-non-opinion
and I never did.#Statement-non-opinion
I just went back and signed the papers#Statement-non-opinion
and I knew nothing about my car when I got it.#Statement-non-opinion

I put the top down everywhere I go.#Statement-non-opinion
I timed it when I first got it#Statement-non-opinion

in her home.#Other
And she, she hired an au pair, which is a college kid to come in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the house.#Statement-non-opinion

So that is a different way.#Statement-non-opinion
And then my other girlfriend just, you know, tears her hair out and goes at it, you know, twenty-four hours a day, watching both kids all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
And I think there is a point where you just have to get away.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it is good for the kid#Statement-opinion
and it is good for you to develop, you know, your interest so you do not stop growing#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at the same time.#Other
Well, I know the family is really going through changes.#Statement-non-opinion

That#Statement-opinion
women#Other

working out of their own home.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They are bringing offices, I mean, jus-, I mean big businesses into their home.#Statement-opinion
Bringing their computers home#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and working from there.#Other
And I think, you know, the more we try to, you know, shape that, the more input we,#Statement-opinion

have into what that whole system is going to look like. Because that is, that is our choice now too.#Other
That is,#Statement-opinion
Well, I think,#Statement-opinion
that is our cause.#Other
I think one that would be, uh,#Other
it is, uh,#Uninterpretable
kids could see their parents, you know, how hard they work,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they would understand more.#Statement-opinion
When, uh, we first moved down here, I was working.#Statement-non-opinion
I was working a twelve hour shift,#Statement-non-opinion

So,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
See the-, the-, the economic situation on the whole thing.#Statement-non-opinion
And then, uh, well it is,#Uninterpretable
see we do have things that we are concerned about here.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
This generation,#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
Social change is always going to go on,#Statement-opinion
but I think we have taken a big leap in the last, you know, twenty, thirty years.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, nothing is the same.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
it seems like it is totally different.#Statement-opinion
Of course, I do not have much to compare it to.#Statement-non-opinion
To me,#Statement-opinion
Well.#Uninterpretable
our causes do not seem as important as you all's were.#Other
Do you know what I mean?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
But we, we grew, we passed them on to you, you know,#Statement-opinion
I mean,#Uninterpretable
You, you what?#Signal-non-understanding
I said, "We passed#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
them#Other
We passed them on to us.#Summarize/reformulate

.#Non-verbal
I mean, you know, because it takes a lot of hard work.#Statement-opinion
It takes writing letters to Congressmen and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, just being very, very politically astute about how to shape and mold the future.#Other
And, and, uh, you know, um, did we make the right choices?#Rhetorical-Questions
We do not know,#Statement-opinion
we will never know.#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
I mean, you know, I, I think we made a wrong choice when I look at the children of today.#Statement-opinion

I think we made some big wrong choices.#Statement-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think business got in the way.#Statement-opinion
I think the greed of the eighties got,#Statement-opinion

Okay.#Other
Okay.#Other
What can we do about crime?#Wh-Question
I don't know.#Hedge
The one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're, they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people#Statement-non-opinion
and they keep letting out people that have, you know, these horrible records.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something.#Statement-opinion
That's one thing I guess I could think of#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, it's definitely a big concern,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I mean every day it's, you know, all ar-,#Uninterpretable
we live in a little small town,#Statement-non-opinion
and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
And you just can't get away from it no matter where you live.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I,#Uninterpretable
So it's pretty scary.#Statement-opinion
I'm, I'm from Butler,#Statement-non-opinion
and I can't say that there's too much of that there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I know the bigger cities have problems with it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I really don't know what we can do about it.#Hedge
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Unless#Statement-opinion
It's rough, because#Statement-opinion
they start enforcing the, uh,#Other
uh, start giving more people death sentences.#Statement-opinion
That's the only thing I can think of.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous.#Statement-opinion
I mean you hear about people, you know, six and seven times have committed burglaries#Statement-opinion
and they're still, you know, only serving six months in prison.#Statement-opinion
So that's definitely something.#Statement-opinion
They could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like, you know, from one month to ten years or something#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That would be one thing that, you know, I think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties, you know, for certain crimes#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, uh, I don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And one things that they're saying, now,#Statement-non-opinion
are you going,#Yes-No-Question
are you a student#Yes-No-Question
or are you in the work force#Or-Clause
or,#Uninterpretable
Um, I'm a senior at Clarion University.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Because one of the things that I've heard so much about l-, um, lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much.#Statement-non-opinion
And apparently many of the, especially like in date rape, many of the, uh, you know, perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up.#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Statement-opinion
And they don't really,#Statement-non-opinion
not only that, a lot of them's not even turned in.#Other
You know,#Yes-No-Question
Wow.#Appreciation
what I mean?#Other
A lot of times#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Yes answers
the girls don't even report it.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I've heard of a few case up here,#Statement-non-opinion
but I can't say that I've heard of, uh, you know, any significant amount.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They say like only one in ten are reported.#Statement-non-opinion
I believe it.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's awful.#Appreciation
So one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it.#Statement-opinion
I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
But I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, you know, for people to report it.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that's probably something else they could do.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know,#Hedge
it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know.#Other
And that's like as long as,#Uninterpretable
it almost makes me feel, in a way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
because these kids are saying why should I go to high school#Statement-opinion
and so I can go out and work at Burger King, you know, for four dollars an hour or whatever, when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs.#Quotation
So that's certainly a big problem.#Statement-opinion
I don't know what the solution to that is.#Statement-opinion
Having more drug treatment centers available.#Statement-opinion
Jeez, I don't know.#Hedge
Uh. See, you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know a lot of people that partake in that.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'm not saying they're bad people,#Statement-non-opinion
but I, I, I would say that's a bigger problem.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because it ends up,#Uninterpretable
even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, you know,#Statement-opinion
huge amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, you know, on higher and higher up,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on drugs,#Other
and it's definitely got to do with crime.#Statement-opinion
You know, you hear about people selling their babies, you know, to get some crack.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I mean, just, oh,#Uninterpretable
gosh, horrible stuff like that.#Statement-opinion
One of the things they're doing is, is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They said, uh, some of the statis-, statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack,#Statement-non-opinion
and their moms are crack users.#Statement-non-opinion
So that's, you know, another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal, you know, for doing that to her child.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I don't know who's the victim there.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean the kids are the victim, it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted.#Statement-opinion
And, it's a very complicated problem.#Statement-opinion
I don't envy the government trying to cope with it. Gosh.#Statement-non-opinion
No, I don't either.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I guess that's about all I have to say.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Is there anything else you would want to,#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
I can't say that I, I just know that it's really bad in some areas#Statement-opinion
and something's going to have to be done sooner#Statement-opinion

It's frustrating.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well,#Uninterpretable
Okay.#Conventional-closing

Regarding, uh, taxes. I, you know,#Other
taxes are really a necessary evil and, in a civilized society.#Statement-opinion
But really, people get upset at taxes because you, it's more efficient to do things yourself.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, and so as, as a result, uh, you know, it's, it's a trade-off, you know, for the common good, you know. For, for the benefit of others, you know.#Statement-opinion
How much of your resource should you dedicate to, uh, making things work for others?#Rhetorical-Questions
Have you, uh, you know, ever thought, you know, just how much of that money should, should go to other people that really don't deserve it?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, well yeah#Yes answers
I know it's, it's a lot, you know that, uh, that I feel like, you know, just like you said, that, there's just so much that you can do yourself. That you take care of your own self that you don't need the money for#Statement-opinion
but they're giving it to other people that don't really need it ei-, either,#Statement-opinion
but yet they accept it.#Statement-opinion
Well, the thing of it is,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
if I wanted to just, uh, you know, permanently become a book reader, I guess I could just, uh, you know, uh, go on public assistance, uh, you know#Other
Like so many people do.#Statement-opinion
lo-, lo-, look for, uh, look for people to, uh, take care of me.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, probably a good woman,#Statement-opinion
right?#Tag-Question
Right#Affirmative non-yes answers
Just, you know, just, just con somebody to take care of me.#Statement-opinion
And then you don't have to be on the tax roll.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, but taxes are, are very difficult kind of thing#Statement-opinion
and everybody really hates it.#Statement-opinion
It was very timely.#Statement-opinion
I, I, I always over pay my, my deductions#Statement-non-opinion
so I wind up with my,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
getting money back on my, uh, from my, uh, withholding.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, you know, that, that's always a smile.#Statement-non-opinion
But, of course, you know, I've, I've paid it in#Statement-non-opinion
and I should calculate it better.#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
are you in business for yourself?#Other
No.#No answers
I, I, I work for the F B I.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So I, I'm a federal employee.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Guess I don't sound like it huh?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, well, I th-,#Uninterpretable
no#No answers
I think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as, as everybody else, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I belong .#Uninterpretable
Unless you work for Internal Revenue#Other
Oh I, I've got all four feet in the trough, you know, being a federal employee.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and so, but, but I can understand that, uh, that, you know, the, uh, who gets benefits.#Statement-non-opinion
Like every, every time there is a, a bond issue#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, I vote no on every one of them.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm, I,#Uninterpretable
but there,#Uninterpretable
this is, this is, tax not tax revolt country.#Statement-opinion
I mean there's too many,#Statement-opinion
every one of us, most of us have our, have all four feet in the trough, you know. Plus our snout, right up to our ears.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you know, it's not exactly that kind of a place that, that you want to, you know, get into a tax revolt situation.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, uh, the, uh, the local taxes here, I, I,#Uninterpretable
i-, in this particular area, uh, you know, I've, uh, I think I pay about, uh, oh thirty-five hundred for, for taxes on my four bedroom house, you know.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And which is a lot of money.#Other
An-, and, uh, and so as, as people get older and older, uh, you know, they think about retirement and that sort of thing#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and they, they're building old people's homes, uh, you know, at tax expense.#Statement-non-opinion
Well I think, you know, the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper.#Statement-opinion
At thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars I'm paying in taxes,#Statement-non-opinion
why I, I could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a, rent a house for that,#Statement-opinion
right?#Tag-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
that's right.#Statement-non-opinion
You know. In, in, instead, it's, it's the taxes here#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Course I don't know whether I want to go to Bulverde or not, you know#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or Seguin or someplace like that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer.#Statement-opinion
And, and I think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer.#Statement-opinion
If you're not going to use them, then you want to be in, in environment.#Statement-opinion
That's a strategy I think tha-, that the people have to, have to take. Is, is how to be able to, to lessen their cost of living. You know,#Statement-opinion
I'm, I'm five or six years before I'm eligible to retire#Statement-non-opinion
and, and I'm saying well, you know, I really can't stay here, uh, as a retiree.#Statement-opinion
After you retire,#Summarize/reformulate
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's too expensive.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm going to have go out and, you know, in, you know, East Fork someplace.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and, do my thing, you know.#Other
My parents are in the same situation, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
They, their home is paid for#Statement-non-opinion
but still their taxes are so high, that, you know, my father doesn't feel like he can retire because they couldn't pay their taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
And they have no children in school or, you know, anything now.#Statement-non-opinion
They don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They, they redecorated in nineteen seventy-five, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they're not doing it a-, again, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So. Well, it's certainly, uh, uh,#Uninterpretable
you must be a T I employee.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
You must be what?#Signal-non-understanding
You must be a T I employee?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I'm not#Statement-non-opinion
You're not a T I,#Statement-non-opinion
who do you work for?#Wh-Question
I, I don't work.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm a student.#Statement-non-opinion
I go to school.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm in nursing school#Statement-non-opinion
You, you're,#Uninterpretable

Okay,#Other
well, I'll start off being controversial.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm in favor of it.#Statement-non-opinion
That doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial.#Statement-opinion
Well, it seems to be in the current situations#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime. Particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now.#Statement-opinion
Well, I think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence, need to be reevaluated.#Statement-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think, uh,#Statement-opinion
Crimes against children is one of them.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, definitely.#Agree/Accept
Any, any crimes against person,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I feel, uh, there should be more than a slap on the hand,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and being sent to prison and being released in, uh, two or three years.#Other
Actually, I would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in Middle Eastern countries.#Statement-non-opinion
If you steal, you lose a hand.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's a,#Uninterpretable
You know, uh, if you kill, you lose your life.#Statement-opinion
What's wrong with that?#Wh-Question
I don't see a thing wrong with that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I believe that, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, it's just an, an example.#Other
I think there's, uh, someone that's on trial right now#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
here in the Dallas area,#Other
and they were interviewing the, the,#Statement-non-opinion
a young lady was killed sometime back,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a young girl.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A personal trial and the reporter was asking a stup-, stupid question of the people outside. * Shouldn't the continued statement end after "A personal trial" and a new slash unit begin?#Other
Well, how do you feel about this?#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
how do they feel about it, I'm sure that, uh, they want it over with * Seems that a slash should be placed after "feel about it"#Other
and they want the person punished and punished,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
properly.#Other
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Deciding what that proper punishment is, is one thing.#Statement-opinion
I think that there should be no way, I, I realize that innocent people could go to, uh, what is it, lethal injection now.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Innocent people could do that,#Statement-opinion
but for every innocent person who would be executed, hopefully there would be ten guilty.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I feel like the, the cost of s-, someone who's quoting figures made the cost,#Other
Uh-huh.#Other
at like thirty thousand dollars,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a year#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to keep someone in prison.#Other
To maintain a prison inma-,#Summarize/reformulate
that's right.#Agree/Accept
That's stupid.#Statement-opinion
And, well, the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There are more,#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and more instances being on the news,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or this individual was out on the streets,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on probation or parole and killed someone else.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or,#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
seriously injured someone.#Other
Well, I don't have solutions to the problems,#Statement-non-opinion
but you know you have these,#Statement-non-opinion
this would be nice if#Statement-opinion
and there's probably thousands of holes in that theory,#Statement-opinion
but I think that if you did something, for example, to an individual and caused them to lose the ability to earn a living, I remember a man drove by randomly shot a woman in the head while she was driving * Seems that "I remember' starts a new thought#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
blinded her.#Other
I think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
I think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
indeed.#Agree/Accept
or the family of an individual.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, who has been harmed you, you, you know.#Other
People who kill policemen.#Statement-non-opinion
Policemen who are killed in the line of duty. * Between this utterance and B.70, there seem to be 3 slash units#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They may or may not have been willfully intending to kill that policeman, but that family still has no provider. * See note above. Also, this should probably end in a slash because B.72 starts with a coord. conjunct. and a subject#Other
No.#Agree/Accept
And I s-,#Other
Here again, anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, the opportunity exists for someone to get killed.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Now I'm not in favor of gun control to the degree or anything because, uh, there are uses for guns which are noncriminal#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them. Uh, aside from domestic disputes, husbands shooting wives or vice versa.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But these individuals, if they have a gun with them, I think that the, the sentence should be even longer than if they don't.#Statement-opinion
I don't, I don't agree with the length,#Reject
Well,#Statement-non-opinion
of the sentence though.#Other
I think expediency is the answer.#Statement-opinion
Well, but here again, uh, if a matter of expediency,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
part of these costs like the people on Death Row#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is that their appeals can take years and years.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
There should be some, uh,#Statement-opinion
I know there's a law, I believe, that it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I think that automatic appeal ought to take place, uh, within a reasonable length of time, say six months.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And a decision be made and not drag out in the courts for years,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities,#Other
That's right,#Agree/Accept
there might be.#Other
technical,#Repeat-phrase
I think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
there's got to be a,#Statement-opinion
Yo-,#Uninterpretable
you can appeal it once.#Statement-opinion
there's got to be a time limit.#Other
I think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands, then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is, if, if it is,#Statement-opinion
A, a legit,#Collaborative Completion
contradictory.#Other
legitimate appeal,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
not a technicality,#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
of, uh,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if, and they're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime.#Other
They're arguing over, well, were his civil rights violated because, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time.#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Those are the things that have caused them to drag out I think.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Well, one of the sad things is that so many of these never actually come to trial because of, of the process in which the criminals were apprehended.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, uh, you know the guy is guilty.#Statement-opinion
You know he's done what he's done.#Statement-opinion
You, you may have stood there and seen it.#Statement-opinion
But because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested, you know,#Statement-opinion
He didn't see his,#Summarize/reformulate
he, he goes free.#Other
lawyer as quickly as he should have,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or some,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
some Mickey Mouse type thing like that.#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
and I realize that that is designed to protect the innocent.#Statement-non-opinion
It's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yes#Agree/Accept
And, uh, I, I just don't think that,#Statement-opinion
I think we could get along a lot better in our criminal justice system if we had some statute of limitations on lawyers#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
I hope you're not a lawyer#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I'm not a lawyer#Negative non-no answers
.#Non-verbal
I,#Uninterpretable
I'm an accountant#Statement-non-opinion
and I agree.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers,#Statement-non-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
to a degree.#Other
That's why you check books out from the library.#Statement-opinion
There you go.#Agree/Accept
But I really believe that our justice system is, is the best around#Statement-opinion
but it's not perfect,#Statement-opinion
and that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact. *#Statement-opinion
Well, it's, it's a case that we have a, a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
So#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
that's how we get caught in this, uh#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sort of a catch twenty-two.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
But you have to continue, uh, to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
And, and, it,#Uninterpretable
I don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that just,#Uninterpretable
that really does ruffle my feathers,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes#Agree/Accept
at times.#Other
It does,#Other
I mean I can just get so,#Statement-non-opinion
most people.#Other
aggravated about it.#Other
But, you know, it's, it's going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem#Statement-opinion
And I hope,#Statement-opinion
Again one of our#Statement-opinion
not lawyers#Other
one of our problems is that, uh, our legislature and the state and our national congress, the majority of the members thereof are lawyers.#Other

Huh.#Uninterpretable
I mean, they'll have some things in there that almost, almost, you know, like supernatural, or something,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, I mean, somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does#Statement-non-opinion

but, it's very, uh, unique show and very well done.#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
Excellent actors.#Statement-opinion
I'll have to watch for that.#Statement-non-opinion

I can't take all these shows on because next semester I'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television.#Statement-non-opinion

And by the end of February, the way they do it nowadays.#Statement-non-opinion

They were all accusing each other of everything in the world#Statement-opinion
Oh, that was awful#Statement-opinion
and who knows still, what ha-, really happened, you know.#Rhetorical-Questions
Well, I know,#Agree/Accept
gosh, you never will, probably.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

so,#Uninterpretable
Well, I think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I know.#Agree/Accept
I don't have cable.#Statement-non-opinion
Now I told ,#Uninterpretable
no,#Agree/Accept
we don't have that station either,#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh, I haven't been able to catch any of that,#Statement-non-opinion
but just what little we caught on the news.#Statement-non-opinion
It's just as wild as any soap opera, from what I hear on the news.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I know it.#Agree/Accept
And I think he's guilty as the devil.#Statement-opinion
Well, I don't see how he couldn't be, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Agree/Accept
what's in it for her.#Rhetorical-Questions
There's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
Because you know they tear you to shreds, especially those rich#Other
Oh, and they said#Statement-non-opinion
high powered lawyers.#Other
this lawyer is unbelievable.#Other
Um.#Uninterpretable
But, they said she held up so well yesterday.#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Agree/Accept
everybody was saying that#Statement-non-opinion
and then, in the paper said it#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It should be interesting.#Other
Oh, God.#Appreciation
Well, the NATIONAL ENQUIRER says#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I was reading that in the supermarket line.#Statement-non-opinion
I never have the nerve to buy the thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Oh, shoot,#Appreciation
well, do you watch any, uh#Yes-No-Question
Says he,#Statement-non-opinion
any sports or anything like that#Other
or,#Uninterpretable
No,#No answers
I don't care anything about that.#Statement-non-opinion
Because I don't either.#Statement-non-opinion
I can't, I can't watch it on T V,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
I like the ice skating,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, occasionally, some ice skating will come on, on a Sunday or during the Olympics#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I always watch that.#Statement-non-opinion
I think it's so beautiful.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I like to catch the gymnastics sometimes, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's good.#Statement-opinion

Uh, we are to discuss air pollution and, uh, what we think the causes are.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I probably would, uh, target, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
industry as being number one polluter.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's probably a major one.#Statement-opinion
I think, uh, individually, uh, just by the vast number of people there are, there's I think cars are also a major contributor to it.#Statement-opinion
Well, vehicles#Dispreferred answers
and, and,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
yes.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
vehicles#Repeat-phrase
Right,#Agree/Accept
because, uh, there's a lot of commercial vehicles out there,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
especially those, the big rigs like the busses and, um,#Other
.#Non-verbal
the big,#Other
Huh .#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, eighteen wheelers and so forth.#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think they would generate probably, uh, one of them would probably generate enough for three cars.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
But that's not,#Uninterpretable
and I think it can be resolved if, uh, if they really let go with,#Statement-opinion
Just a minute, I'm on the phone#3rd-party-talk
the technology that they have at, uh, at their hand,#Other
and they haven't released it yet.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think there's a lot of hold back, uh, because,#Statement-opinion

of, uh, oh, priorities that they have,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other

Oh, okay#Response Acknowledgement

Do you have, do you watch children#Yes-No-Question
or do you,#Or-Clause
Um, I have three of my own#Statement-non-opinion
and I have, uh, two that I'm tending for the summer.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Off and on,#Other
so,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's interesting.#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
Um, is there anything,#Yes-No-Question
They cause more noise pollution than air pollution#Statement-non-opinion
Well, temporarily they do.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
Then we get out of that phase,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
soon enough.#Other
But, um, I think another,#Statement-opinion
you can tell when you go around cities, you can smell specific things from, from, specific industries.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Statement-non-opinion
I remember being,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I grew up in New Jersey#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I can remember the smell of Newark vividly#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's the type of industry, you know, which obviously if you can smell it, it's in the air.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I know, uh, uh, in Michigan, uh, the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it,#Statement-non-opinion
and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, of course, now,#Uninterpretable
Well, people think you burn it, it's gone,#Statement-opinion
but it's not gone.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
and when they,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
and you bury it#Statement-non-opinion
and it's not gone either, because it has untold ramifications.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh,#Statement-opinion
Then it just gets into the soil and into the water#Statement-non-opinion
And it gets into, into people,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, which is, uh, the, the most important, um, resource that we have is people,#Other
and they're, and they're destroying us,#Statement-opinion
they,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
really are.#Other
We really have to do more,#Statement-opinion
So I think the cockroach will evolve, uh, sa-, safely#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So they say#Hedge
I think we've got to do more with the recycling.#Statement-opinion
That's,#Uninterpretable
I'm, I'm really glad to see that there's more of that happening.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
but there's not enough.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we need expert cooperation.#Statement-opinion
Well, it's a,#Uninterpretable
we're getting,#Uninterpretable
at least they're starting, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Education of the,#Statement-opinion
So at least they're moving that direction.#Statement-opinion
Education of the people is primary, I would think.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, and we're hard to teach.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well,#Uninterpretable
We are hard to teach.#Statement-opinion
it's going to, it's probably going to be a generation or two before,#Statement-opinion
Absolutely,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
before it's really going,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
very well, because now the adults are more aware of it,#Other
and the children are being taught in the schools more, it'll be, you know, on down the road this is going to be passed on, which is good.#Statement-opinion
Absolutely,#Agree/Accept
yes.#Agree/Accept
Uh, of course, uh, we would like to see it accelerated because, uh, of the critical nature of it.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The, the learning of it and the,#Statement-opinion
just to, um, think that way, we have to be in that thought pattern and able to, um, motivate ourselves to, um, uh, do what is right for the atmosphere.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I think we're all contributors.#Statement-opinion
I mean, every human being that lives is a contributor,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to pollution,#Other
so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we just um.#Other
I think you're right,#Agree/Accept
education is a big thing#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
and as we educate them individually what they can do, people become more aware of the things in industry too that, that are causing problems#Statement-opinion
and, and I think that they'll grad-, they'll work towards solving those problems more too. Um,#Statement-opinion
Well, hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That the time frame for cleaning up our air and our, and our, um, land, you know, which, uh, we get our nutrients from.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, I mean,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
everything goes back to the land.#Other
Just a minute and I'll turn it up.#3rd-party-talk
I'll turn it up in a minute, honey, when I'm done.#3rd-party-talk
So um, it's just, um, very critical, I think at this point to,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
uh, get that through to the people and get us educated.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I think science has come a long way to making it so that it's possible to find ways to solve the problem#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um,#Uninterpretable
I, I don't know if they offer classes in, uh, the, uh, in the grade school,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
uh, uh, subjecting.#Other
I think they teach it a lot in science#Statement-non-opinion
In science,#Repeat-phrase
okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I would think that that's where it would come through.#Statement-non-opinion
What grade level would that be?#Wh-Question
Would that be, um, perhaps,#Yes-No-Question
I,#Statement-non-opinion
the first grade level, which would be,#Other
I think they're kind of getting it in all different grades.#Other
Well, I mean, are they starting, though, at, at, with the children that are so,#Yes-No-Question
their little minds are like sponges#Statement-opinion
and they can really#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, relate to that.#Other
I think they are starting probably in the first grade.#Statement-non-opinion
They're, you know, they're hearing somewhat about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I know, uh, Target has their program to make kids more aware of it#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Target stores?#Signal-non-understanding
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
They've got, if you go in the entrance, they've got, uh, stands usually where they have, um, little, uh, kind of a little newspaper thing#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that the kids can read#Other
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Response Acknowledgement
and they can form a, a group to, um,#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
help fight the pollution.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Oh, that's wonderful.#Appreciation
So,#Uninterpretable
Well, I'm sure that, uh, perhaps they're the leaders, you know,#Statement-opinion
and other will, others will pick up on their example and carry it, uh, further.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, because, uh, thoughts are,#Statement-opinion
Well, I, I know it's har-, it's a hard problem to solve because you, you know, like McDonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more,#Statement-non-opinion
and then there's the paper and plastic bag question.#Statement-non-opinion

Okay,#Other
what do you think are some current trends in, uh, the way families spend time together, based on what you've seen.#Wh-Question
Um, I, I think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I think, uh, like in my situation, today, on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together, my husband's been off doing his thing all day today,#Statement-opinion
and I've been off doing my thing all day#Statement-non-opinion
and I haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning.#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Appreciation
So, uh.#Uninterpretable
Are you newly married,#Yes-No-Question
or,#Or-Clause
Um, two years.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Same, same situation here, I've been married about ten months,#Statement-non-opinion
so. Yeah,#Uninterpretable
I can, I can, I know what you mean.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, it's really hard, hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and, uh, you both have hobbies that are different.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, if you have hobbies that are the same, then, you know, you can enjoy your hobby together,#Statement-opinion
but my husband and I have different hobbies.#Statement-non-opinion
Is he a hunter and a fisher and all that.#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
no,#No answers
he's a record collector and a Hot Wheels collector.#Statement-non-opinion
That's we-, that's wild.#Appreciation
Um, so he was off today, uh, looking at, at records.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, and I was off, you know, doing, you know, hou-, household type things.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, laundry#Other
and, um, did some shopping and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, from the people I've talked to, I don't know if I should bring this into it,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more, um, where they could manage their own schedule#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, they could spend more time with their kids#Other
because they look back#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, they're all like, um, kind of regretful, I think.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I think, I think that would be the ideal situation,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I think that would be the ideal situation.#Statement-opinion
I think that a lot of people,#Uninterpretable
like in my case I, I do shift work.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't, I don't have that choice.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
same here.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I have to be at work at, at X hour, you know, at just, at, at a certain hour#Statement-non-opinion
and I can't, it's not flexible.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, it, it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours#Statement-opinion
and, and maybe after we decide to have kids I, I might find a job that has flexible hours.#Statement-non-opinion
I woul-, I hope so anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, but I would, I don't know.#Hedge
At T I, is that where you work?#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
It's really kind of sad,#Statement-opinion
some of the people that I work with they, like when I worked on second shift, um, their paren-, their kids go to school during the day#Statement-non-opinion
and then they wouldn't see them at night,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because they would be in, you know, at work and the kids are all ready in bed.#Other
And so it was kind of like, they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses.#Statement-non-opinion
This relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends, or something, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it was really sad, jus-, you know that a lot of families, um, have to, well, you know, have to have dual income.#Statement-opinion
A lot of people choose to, which is fine.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, you know, then the kids kind of suffer.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, ideally, it wo-, it would be nice to be able to just have, like, back in the old days,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh, huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, back like whe-, when I grew up,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
the, the mom stayed home, you know, and raised the kids.#Statement-non-opinion
My mom didn't go back to work until I was in junior high school.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, so she was there pretty much all my, you know, formative years.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that was nice#Statement-non-opinion
and I liked that#Statement-non-opinion
and I would hope that I would be able to give that to my kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I think with the way the future is, um, economy wise,#Statement-opinion
I don't think it's going to be realistic.#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
Unfortunately, that's probably true.#Agree/Accept
Um, do you think s-, the, the parents spend quality time with their kids#Yes-No-Question
are do you think it's more like watching T V and stuff like that, not really, uh ...#Yes-No-Question
I, yeah, I, I think that, I think very few spend quality time.#Statement-opinion
I think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff, stuff like that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that, um, uh, most, most kids that I see don't really, they don't really value quality time.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept
it's always that way unti-, until it's too late.#Statement-opinion
Until, until they're older#Statement-opinion
and then they look back.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's true, um.#Agree/Accept
What's, what are some other questions they have,#Wh-Question
, I'm not sure.#Hedge
I know my parents are growing up,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess they never spent much time watching T V.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, I've never seen my mom turn on the T V,#Statement-non-opinion
we didn't really have one .#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
and, and they spent a lot of time like outside with us and stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, my dad had his own business#Statement-non-opinion
and it was easier for them to do that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, I, I don't know,#Hedge
it was, I guess I didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I think kids now a days are raised on T V.#Statement-opinion
I mean that's, that's almost like a surog-,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
T V -s a surrogate parent.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's a good way to put it.#Statement-opinion
And not a, and not a very good one at that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's a pretty good way to put it#Statement-opinion
If I had kids, well if you had kids, what kind of things do you hope to do?#Open-Question
Um, I, I hope to, of course, be able to teach them right from wrong.#Statement-non-opinion
I hope, I hope to be able to spend, um, their growing up years, being in the home, you know, not having to work.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, and being able to do,#Other
I, I, I know a lot of people wh-, who, um, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I work part-time also,#Statement-non-opinion
and I#Uninterpretable
a lot of people that I work for are, mothers that stay home.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, and they, they do a lot of volunteer work#Statement-non-opinion
and they're real active in the community#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I'd, I'd like to be able to do that.#Statement-non-opinion
I'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Do volunteer work and,#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
be in clubs and stuff,#Other
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree.#Agree/Accept
I hope that happens, in my case.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, I think that's for the, the few and far between.#Statement-opinion
I think that, uh, probably ninety percent of the,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of the, um parents out there are, are probably working parents.#Other
Yeah. Huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I, I don't, I don't really see that, that trend changing much,#Statement-opinion
if anything, I think,#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
there's going to be fewer and fewer, uh, single income families.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That may not necessarily be consistent with yours.#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
See I, I never, I don't even know what day care is really all about because I, I never went to a day care center,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I never, I never had that kind of experience.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh. I, well I don't even think we had#Statement-non-opinion
I don't even remember them being around when we were little.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I see, it seems like that's, that's a big trend, you know, in the last ten years.#Statement-opinion
Day cares have, have, have popped up and become a lot more, um, a lot bigger part of, of the kids' lives.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's like a home away from home for a lot of them.#Statement-opinion
Sure, is, um,#Agree/Accept
well, I guess we could ring this off since we, we've exhausted all of our ideas,#Statement-non-opinion
we seem to agree.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I think, yeah I think this is a good closing point.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
so,#Uninterpretable
Well it was really nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have got an uncle in Louisiana and another sister here in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you all get together often?#Yes-No-Question

We did when I was growing up.#Statement-non-opinion
It was every summer we got together.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now, my grandmother just passed away this last year.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you know,#Uninterpretable
I think as#Statement-non-opinion
she was th-,#Uninterpretable
we get older, it is dif-, more difficult to, uh, when#Other
all my aunts and uncles are in their eighties now,#Statement-non-opinion
so it is, uh,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have to, uh, I will probably have to take charge and do it one of these, uh, one of these, uh, days.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Well it,#Statement-opinion
I still have elderly parents alive.#Other
So, uh, it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date, you know#Statement-non-opinion
It#Other
that,#Other
sure does.#Other
And if they are,#Uninterpretable
Well, we,#Uninterpretable
in Kentucky it wasn't hard because everybody lives so close together.#Statement-non-opinion
We just did it word by mou-, you know, by word of mouth.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know. And, uh, my uncle in Louisiana, he is the only one that, you know, had to travel.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

I like getting the paper and reading the want ads#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I would read that every day because you would find ten minutes here that you do not have anything to do.#Other

There are some times when you have got ten or fifteen or even an hour off#Statement-opinion

Not much,#Other
not in the area I worked in#Statement-non-opinion
We had an engineer in there every ten minutes.#Statement-non-opinion

I did not even know, I still do not know what the whole deal was with that.#Statement-non-opinion

Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, he had a young girlfriend.#Statement-non-opinion
He was, he is well into his forties,#Statement-non-opinion

Immediately.#Appreciation
Uh, which is tough.#Other
So that is all it was?#Yes-No-Question

Well, that#Affirmative non-yes answers
and, uh, his business is going down the tubes so bad, you know.#Statement-non-opinion

He was, uh, uh, essentially like you said, a tycoon.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, Donald Trump and had it all.#Statement-opinion
He was high roller for about ten years,#Statement-non-opinion
and then he is now, uh, essentially bankrupt, you know.#Statement-non-opinion

That has got to be hard to go from really rich#Statement-opinion

No,#Agree/Accept
right, uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
who knows, uh,#Hedge

But, uh, he was kind of an arro-, arrogant guy,#Statement-opinion
so I think the newsmen, uh, enjoyed, uh, writing about him on his way down, you know.#Statement-opinion

And his wife was very, uh, uh, seemed to be very smart. And actually running some of his business.#Statement-non-opinion

Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I have got three kids#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can imagine.#Statement-non-opinion

Except for Donald Duck.#Other
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
Uh, uh, I know what you mean, really.#Statement-non-opinion

My, my wife and I are, u-, in our forties, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the, they're the pivot point of the universe.#Statement-opinion
I think you are right#Agree/Accept
because I was an only child too.#Statement-non-opinion
And that's one reason I have so many because I really, I enjoy the big family.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters#Statement-non-opinion
and so she is sort of like an only child#Statement-non-opinion
and it's the same type of thing, uh,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have a younger brother like that.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm in my forties, like I say#Statement-non-opinion
and I have a brother in his twenties.#Statement-non-opinion

Right.#Agree/Accept
That's exactly how it is, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
She's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her.#Statement-non-opinion
When things don't go right, she just calls one of them, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, yeah,#Uninterpretable
it, it's a little bit difficult, though.#Statement-non-opinion
I think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more.#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Uninterpretable
Did you all do a lot of organized things like, uh, Little League, uh, soccer?#Yes-No-Question
We, we really did not.#Negative non-no answers
My next oldest daughter that's in college in California is a world twirling champion.#Statement-non-opinion
She twirls a baton#Statement-non-opinion
and we did a lot of things together.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
She and I did a lot of things together and flew,#Statement-non-opinion
we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that was a lot of fun.#Statement-non-opinion
But that, that, I guess you could consider that organized.#Statement-opinion
I mean, there is a competition all the time.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We were very heavy into that.#Statement-non-opinion
Other than that, they were pretty much,#Statement-non-opinion
and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I think that's probably true. The,#Statement-opinion
if you have one child or fewer, you get involved in organized events or#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
activities#Other
and if you have a large number of children or, then you don't.#Statement-opinion
Well, you can't afford to.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
you ca-,#Uninterpretable
and there's not enough time, uh#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
like my son is in, uh, Little League this year.#Statement-non-opinion
He's ten.#Statement-non-opinion
And they practice three times a week#Statement-non-opinion
and they have a game#Statement-non-opinion
and it's just, uh, if there were more than one child, I don't know, the-, there would be no way to do it.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
That's right.#Agree/Accept
You know, one parent go one direction#Statement-opinion
and I'd have to go in the other#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we could only cover two at that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I know I spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter#Statement-non-opinion
and my little one also competed because really she had no choice.#Statement-non-opinion
She had to go with me.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and, and competing#Statement-non-opinion
and, of course, the competing itself, really didn't matter what it was,#Statement-opinion
it was making the friends and going all the places#Statement-opinion
and it was a really neat experience,#Statement-non-opinion
but it took our total time.#Statement-non-opinion
I did not work, uh, when I did this.#Statement-non-opinion
Now I do work full-time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's just,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
my thirteen year old and myself#Other
and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other.#Statement-non-opinion
So ,#Uninterpretable
I don't think, although i-, i-,#Statement-opinion
I think a, a, more than one child, probably three children is probably the ideal to me#Statement-opinion
but I'm not sure I could afford three.#Statement-opinion
I most certainly couldn't educate three.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I don't know how my, my parents did it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, there were five of us#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, but I don't know how my father did it.#Statement-non-opinion
He worked at a truck line#Statement-non-opinion
and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children.#Statement-non-opinion
But we did okay.#Statement-non-opinion
We had a house and a home and,#Statement-non-opinion
but now, my wife and I both work#Statement-non-opinion
and we don't, I don't believe we have as much as my parents did#Statement-non-opinion
and we only have one child.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, things cost a lot more.#Statement-opinion
I don't know how it is in Georgia#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some.#Statement-opinion
Atlanta is horrible.#Statement-non-opinion
Is it?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Ha-, we have a lot of people moving here from Boston and, and different areas#Statement-non-opinion
and from talking to them, they're shocked.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Wha-,#Uninterpretable
and they, you know,#Uninterpretable
the housing is so cheap#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in comparison to Boston#Other
That's what I've heard.#Agree/Accept
that they jump on it.#Other
They sell their house,#Statement-non-opinion
they stash away a good bit of money and come down here#Statement-non-opinion
and I work with a lot of them,#Statement-non-opinion
they, they think they, they have really done something.#Statement-non-opinion
Then when they get down here, they realize the cost of living is outrageous#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
compared to, to where they came from.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The housing is cheaper,#Statement-non-opinion
but that's about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm surprised to hear that.#Dispreferred answers
I've heard very positive things about Atlanta,#Statement-opinion

Actually, I'm in,#Uninterpretable
like I said, I'm in Minneapolis#Statement-non-opinion
and the big thing up here, of course, is the twins. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I imagine you can't escape it#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
it's, it's pretty pervasive.#Statement-opinion
It kind of goes into about all aspects of society I think up here.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, actually, I don't know how much of the World Series you caught last year,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
but that was a lot of fun .#Statement-non-opinion
Well, of course, it was fun for you#Statement-opinion
Well, to be honest with you, I'm not from Minneapolis.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, I've only been up here a few months#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm going back at the end of next month.#Statement-non-opinion
To?#Wh-Question
Uh, Orlando, Florida.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything.#Statement-non-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
I was born and raised in, uh, near Miami and, uh, spent the#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
last twenty years in Dallas#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, where the Rangers played.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, for the#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
last, uh, what, year, roughly year, I've been in San Francisco where there are two teams. The Oakland A -s and the San Francisco Giants.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but honestly, you know, I, uh, I do my duty and watch the sports on, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
the newscasts#Other
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but that's about all the exposure I have to sports.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I haven't followed it real closely at all. Uh, except like I said, last year when the World Series rolled around, I did, I did follow that pretty religiously.#Statement-non-opinion
Went out into the bars, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
drank a beer, watched the game, had a gir-, a good time that way.#Other
Oh, yeah,#Other
sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, I guess the, uh, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A -s were like the leading teams a couple of years ago.#Statement-opinion
Is that right?#Yes-No-Question
Well, I th-,#Uninterpretable
well I don't know.#Hedge
That's sort of what I gather.#Hedge
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, and, uh, I don't know.#Hedge
What is the prognosis for, uh, this year?#Wh-Question
Uh, real good as far as I can tell.#Statement-non-opinion
People are pretty excited about it.#Statement-opinion
Good.#Appreciation
I, I assume that means good for the Minnesota#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well yeah#Yes answers
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
Sorry about that,#Apology
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Uh, as far as the Twins are concerned, it seems to be real good.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Uh, my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they won that one seven to one,#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh, that's pretty good I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
It looks like they'll be doing pretty well.#Statement-non-opinion
Are you still there?#Yes-No-Question
Yep#Yes answers
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I heard some noise on the line.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Didn't know what happened.#Statement-non-opinion
I think a train went by.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
All right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know a train went by,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know what the noise was#Statement-non-opinion
but I think it probably was the, the train.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I don't know.#Hedge
I, I, I don't even know, uh, who has been winning in, uh, as far as the, uh, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A -s#Statement-non-opinion
but I think they both won their opener.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh, sort of gathered that in my, uh, subliminal memory.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well maybe that has, has good tidings for their, uh, for their season coming up.#Statement-opinion
I've actually got a friend that's living in San Francisco right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, he's doing the same thing I'm doing which is, basically, uh, an internship.#Statement-non-opinion
We, we're both doctoral students#Statement-non-opinion
and he's#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
doing his with I B M#Other
and I'm doing mine with Honeywell.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, I, I think he kind of follows the sports#Statement-non-opinion
and I think he's mentioned uh, the Oakland A -s a couple of times.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good.#Other
I guess they are different leagues.#Statement-non-opinion
Is that right?#Yes-No-Question
The A -s?#Yes-No-Question
As far as I know,#Affirmative non-yes answers
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Yeah .#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And in the major leagues, I guess there is a couple of different divisions#Statement-non-opinion
and then, of course, there's the minors.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I don't know.#Hedge
I, I guess I'm one of those people that if I really made a concentrated effort, I could really probably get into baseball.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but I was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago, right after that game,#Statement-non-opinion
and he offered, you know, to take me to one of the games because, apparently, he'd bought, uh, he and four other people from Honeywell had bought a seat, or a row of seats actually, for the home games.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But the thing is, there's like eighty-six home games per year.#Statement-non-opinion
So there's no, no way that you can ever use them all.#Statement-non-opinion
Eighty-six?#Repeat-phrase
Eighty-six.#Statement-non-opinion
I was amazed to hear that.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh!#Appreciation
You know, that's just the home games#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I thought it was a mistake#Statement-non-opinion
but he goes no .#Statement-non-opinion
Well they must play every day then.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well just about,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
I mean eighty-six times two#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is a hundred sixty.#Other
And that's, you know,#Uninterpretable
yeah#Uninterpretable
that's almost,#Uninterpretable
And that's, Lord, that's, uh, over five months worth.#Statement-non-opinion
That's a lot of baseball.#Statement-non-opinion
Even if they play every day, that's over five months worth.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you, yo-, if you, if you consider it, the season starts,#Statement-non-opinion
well it's,#Uninterpretable
the season started about a week and a half ago#Statement-non-opinion
and it ends with the World Series which usually takes place, I believe, in December or January.#Statement-opinion
No.#Reject
Yeah,#Yes answers
I think so.#Statement-opinion
It did last we-, year, didn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Or was it November?#Yes-No-Question
That was the Super Bowl.#Statement-non-opinion
Maybe it was November I'm thinking about.#Statement-non-opinion
I know it was doggone cold up here. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't feel so bad.#Statement-non-opinion
I think you, you don't know all that much more than I do about baseball#Statement-opinion
Well, I know for sure it was,#Statement-non-opinion
I know it was after September.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Because that's when I got up here.#Other
I see,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and it was at least two months after I got up here.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
okay .#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it had to be November anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I, I know, uh, the Super Bowl,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay,#Other
Miss Nancy, we should be in business now.#Statement-non-opinion

We have two children,#Statement-non-opinion

and we see our son and his wife uh, about every other week#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we baby-sit quite frequently.#Other
So we're a fairly close-knit family.#Statement-non-opinion

Well, you're very fortunate.#Appreciation

And my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam, Holland.#Statement-non-opinion

Her husband builds pianos,#Other
so it's kind of hard for us to visit with them, as much as I'd like to.#Statement-non-opinion

Because we've, we, one thing we do have together is we're both musicians.#Other
I play in several symphony orchestras#Statement-non-opinion

And then I have a, a son who lives in, uh, Warrington, Pennsylvania.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I get to see him maybe once every three months.#Statement-non-opinion
So I really, we've lost, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I'd like to have an everyday contact with children, uh, as well as you do, for that matter,#Statement-non-opinion
and my young , my youngest daughter lives in New Jersey,#Statement-non-opinion

Oh, most the time,#Uninterpretable

well, right now it's football season,#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Sometimes I'm a little exhausted#Statement-non-opinion
Well, tell me,#Action-directive

I think parents are definitely, uh, spending more and more time.#Statement-opinion
I don't think they're leaving them with baby-sitters, you know.#Statement-opinion

Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for about, uh, I don't know, eight or nine years.#Other

Seems like it went through a spell there where families weren't that big a deal.#Statement-opinion

It seems that progressive,#Statement-non-opinion
I've, been down here five years, just over five years now, that, every spring and summer seems to get more and more rainy.#Statement-non-opinion

and I think it's because it's just getting more crowded and more polluted.#Statement-opinion
I really do think that's part of it.#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, uh, in, in Wisconsin and Minnesota, when they get winters it's, um, th-, the winters are bad, but not what you hear about.#Statement-non-opinion

Well, there,#Uninterpretable
you could talk about that, that's,#Statement-opinion

I'm very familiar,#Other
my grandparents and all my relatives are from Wisconsin.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, there you go, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
So, I'm, uh, quite familiar with how it is up there,#Statement-non-opinion

Um, in terms of Colorado, I know my husband likes to camp and backpack and all the stuff I don't like, um,#Statement-non-opinion

used to go on,#Statement-non-opinion
I worked for a mortgage company in Wisconsin#Statement-non-opinion
and I did a lot of business in, uh, um, Colo-, well, Denver,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's, that's probably one of the stranger things, when you see the air inversions,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then you go into the mountains#Other
and it's snowy#Statement-non-opinion
and col-, uh, it just was a very mixed bag in terms of Colorado.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh sure.#Agree/Accept
My parents just live, uh, thirty miles south of Denver#Statement-non-opinion
and it can be sunny and, and no problem in Denver#Statement-non-opinion
and they'll be having snow#Statement-non-opinion
Isn't that strange?#Backchannel in question form
So it's pretty amazing, it can be that drastic in just a short distance#Statement-non-opinion

and then things like torn-,#Statement-non-opinion
are there tornadoes in Colorado, yes or n-, I don't,#Yes-No-Question
Uh, it's getting to be more and more of a possibility.#Affirmative non-yes answers

as they start to clear more things out.#Other
Even, I mean,#Uninterpretable
I'm originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,#Statement-non-opinion

It's just, you know.#Statement-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
It's definitely not as, um,#Other
I know I associate the pollution with weather in general,#Statement-non-opinion
so I guess one thing we do miss, is that's a smaller town,#Statement-non-opinion

it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere, you know.#Statement-non-opinion

but, you know, it's pretty hard to try, let's say, the man down the street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people,#Statement-opinion
like the juries that I've served on, are businessmen.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now they don't understand that, you know, maybe he needed fifty dollars#Statement-non-opinion
so he held up the seven eleven. *#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
all the time,#Other
so, you know, I think that it, a trial by your peers should be exactly that, someone in your own age bracket,#Statement-opinion
someone that, you know, you can't really do it ethnically, you know,#Statement-opinion
but you could do it,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you could probably get it a little closer.#Other
But then there's another thing that I disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six#Statement-non-opinion
and sometimes you have a jury of twelve.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I don't know why they do that.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you have any reason,#Yes-No-Question
do you know of any reason why they do that?#Yes-No-Question
Well, I think the six is called a Grand Jury#Statement-non-opinion
and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
see#Uninterpretable
Whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused of, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Okay#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and held over for trial.#Other
I don't know much about the Grand Jury.#Statement-non-opinion
How do you feel about the,#Wh-Question
in Texas I noticed since I've been here, in twelve years that they, they break up the, the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know.#Hedge
I, I think that, uh,#Uninterpretable
I know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked.#Statement-non-opinion
However,#Uninterpretable
Well, we know there's a few out there.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
It seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it, you give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong#Statement-opinion
or for, you know,#Uninterpretable
if, if, if the judge is not of high moral standards#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he could be bought off, much easier#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's,#Uninterpretable
than twelve people could.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
would be pretty hard.#Statement-opinion
Well I don't think, you know, I don't think that, if I was the criminal, that I would like the judge passing sentence on me.#Statement-non-opinion
If the jury found me guilty, then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be.#Statement-opinion
And I think it's,#Uninterpretable
not only that, it's a waste of our money.#Statement-opinion
We have to have a trial for this person,#Statement-non-opinion
then two weeks down the road we have to sente-, sent-, excuse me, set a sentencing date#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so now we're back in court again#Other
and that's more money spent.#Statement-non-opinion
It's not so much that I, that, I haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges.#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
What bothers me is that, uh, they really don't mean anything.#Other
Someone could be sentenced to thirty-five years#Statement-non-opinion
and yet, you know, the, the parole system, it's going to let them out in, in three years for good behavior.#Statement-opinion
And it's not working either.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
it's not.#Agree/Accept
It seems that we have more and more repeat offenders.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know,#Agree/Accept
I don't know how you all are there where you're at,#Statement-non-opinion
but where we're at, now our jails are overcrowded.#Statement-non-opinion
We just built a brand new one two years ago.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I think they're all overcrowded.#Statement-opinion
And it's overcrowded.#Statement-non-opinion
They've, uh,#Uninterpretable
So now they start turning them loose.#Statement-non-opinion
I think I heard Fort Worth that, uh, they've been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowded.#Statement-non-opinion
They're not allowed to accept any new inmates.#Statement-non-opinion
Now what are they supposed to do?#Wh-Question
They turn them loose.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, no,#Reject
I mean, they're not allowed to accept any new inmates.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail?#Wh-Question
You know.#Uninterpretable
Well, the way, it seems the way it's been working here's,#Statement-non-opinion
There, yeah,#Uninterpretable
Go ahead. * LISTEN - are utterances 1 and 2 really from the same speaker?#Action-directive
It seems the way it's been working here is they let those out that have spent two or three years out of their five to twenty sentence,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or five to life.#Other
Something that is working#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I really like the system of house arrest where a, a,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that,#Uninterpretable
someone's wear, someone wears a bracelet#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they,#Uninterpretable
like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor,#Other
They keep,#Other
and they are not allowed,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, th-, some of them are even allowed to work,#Statement-non-opinion
they can go to their regular job,#Statement-non-opinion
they come home,#Statement-non-opinion
they have to be home by such and such a time,#Statement-non-opinion
they're instructed, uh, so that, this, this electronic monitor#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is turned on at, at a certain time#Other
and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts.#Statement-non-opinion
All right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, they can put a,#Statement-non-opinion
they usually install a video monitor in the house#Statement-non-opinion
and when the parole officer calls to check on them, they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it.#Statement-non-opinion
All right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they're supposed to be doing#Other
and that's working rather well.#Statement-opinion
That's a good system.#Statement-opinion
That allows people,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it would allow, * slash error#Other
to actually continue to be productive members of society while they're, you know,#Other
Yeah,#Other
instead of being completely penned up.#Summarize/reformulate
paying back for whatever crime they've committed.#Other
And that way it would give, you know,#Statement-opinion
the probation department and parole department, they've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in, in Lubbock.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that would give, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
at least they don't have to drive all over town trying to find one guy,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I've really,#Uninterpretable
or trying to see six or seven people.#Other
I could go on for hours about the criminal justice system and what I think we ought to do about it.#Statement-non-opinion
But,#Statement-non-opinion
Sometimes it's pretty messed up,#Statement-opinion
isn't it.#Tag-Question
Something that I really don't understand is when someone goes to jail#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they have a job in jail and they work, that they should,#Other
I,#Uninterpretable
and this may sound cruel,#Hedge
but I do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes.#Statement-opinion
I mean they're in jail for crying out loud.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What do they need cigarettes for?#Rhetorical-Questions
Well, see#Uninterpretable
and there's another thing about the justice system that I don't like#Statement-non-opinion
and there's a lot of people that tell me that, that maybe my thoughts are wrong.#Statement-non-opinion
I came from California#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and when you're in jail, they take you out just like they do in Alabama or anywhere else, what they call a chain gang.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they clean the city parks.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I think that's a wonderful idea.#Statement-opinion
And they clean the city streets.#Statement-non-opinion
But you know, we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day#Statement-opinion
and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner,#Statement-non-opinion
More than that.#Statement-non-opinion
and I know,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
More than that.#Statement-non-opinion
but I know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock that don't make that much.#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
And they're not, you know, they're not doing anything to support themselves,#Statement-non-opinion
The thing that,#Statement-non-opinion
while they're there.#Other
the thing that gets me is that while we're supporting them,#Other
.#Non-verbal
they're working.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
When they get out of jail they get handed all that money.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That really ticks me off.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that while they are in jail and they are working, their wages#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
should go,#Other
like, I don't know,#Hedge
they could,#Uninterpretable
some percentage, like eighty-five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
figured on a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year.#Other
Uh-huh.#Other
See now .#Uninterpretable
And when they get out they should have a, I don't know, you know, some reasonable amount of money#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to start, like a couple of thousand dollars,#Other
but there should be a limit over which they, that it all goes back to the State.#Statement-opinion
Anything that they've earned while they're in prison should go back to the State except for that, you know, there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but at least they would, at least that way they would be helping pay for their own.#Statement-opinion
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
absolutely.#Agree/Accept
And something else that I would,#Statement-non-opinion
That's the part that I really think we need to change.#Statement-opinion
And something else that I would like to see is, is, uh, victim reimbursement, you know, because they, you know, like you say these guys are in jail#Other
and they're working,#Statement-non-opinion
they're getting paid,#Statement-non-opinion
but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from, or beat to death#Statement-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable
Has nothing,#Collaborative Completion
right.#Agree/Accept
has nothing, you know.#Statement-opinion
Our, our victims are victimized, period,#Statement-opinion
and the law has no, no, uh, regulations to deal with that.#Statement-non-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
They, they know how to deal with the penal system#Statement-opinion
and they know how to deal with the criminal,#Statement-opinion
but they don't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens, I guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it's,#Uninterpretable
but I sure don't,#Uninterpretable
I, I strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There that,#Uninterpretable
I think it works much better if it's, if it's the actual jury.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
because, well, th-, see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the jury gets to see the whole trial, as does the judge,#Statement-non-opinion
but you know, if, if they figure there's maybe litigating circumstances, or something like that whereas maybe the judge does, just doesn't care, you committed this crime#Statement-opinion
so I'm just going to throw the book at you.#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Whereas the jury may have a little, shall we say, sympathy, you know,#Statement-opinion
he did this,#Quotation
but, you know, why did he do this,#Quotation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
in some,#Statement-opinion
is there, is there a basis for it.#Quotation
cases tha-, it would work that way.#Other
In some cases it would work the other way.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
in some cases where the judge says okay, I'll give you, you know, two to three years#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
The jury would, would, slam them#Statement-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I think that, that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time.#Other
Well, they have a stronger debate, too, because there's twelve people there.#Statement-opinion
They have to decide whether or not he's guilty#Statement-non-opinion
and then they can sit in th-, at the same time and decide what his punishment would be,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you'd have more than one person's input on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I think that's probably a much fairer way.#Statement-opinion
And, you know, we're supposed to be, and I quote, in a democratic society.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So, you know, if you can find me guilty, then you ought to be able to pass sentence.#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And a lot of jurors,#Statement-opinion
not that I know of,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, a lot of jurors may just sit there and say, yeah, he's guilty,#Statement-opinion
but I don't have to deal with it from here, you know,#Quotation
so#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the judge takes care of all of that.#Other
It might be more,#Statement-opinion
it would be more work for the jury,#Statement-opinion
but it would be a more responsible#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept
it would,#Agree/Accept
way to deal with it.#Other
yeah,#Agree/Accept
serving on the jury would be definitely more respo-, you'd have to be a definitely more responsible person.#Statement-opinion
The thing that I, I don't really like,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I don't know, if, uh, a lot of jury selection processes that I've seen have been a,#Statement-non-opinion

Uh, with regard to, uh, to jury trials. I, you know, I, I really feel as though, uh, jury trials are, are, uh, whatever system has been, been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the, the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the, the jurisprudence is, you know, based on, on, uh, you know, on accumulated n-, body of law.#Statement-opinion
And if, if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they, they start, they could start going back and digging up all these cases that, uh, that would be handled differently were#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
they judged by today's standards.#Other
So I, I really don't think it, they can really do much of anything to change it.#Statement-opinion
What do you think?#Open-Question
Uh, I, I don't think so.#Statement-opinion
Possibly in the jury selection would be the only,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
just for example, what we're seeing in California I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
It makes you wonder, uh, had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome.#Statement-opinion
Uh, and th-, and the problems that, that has come that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating. Uh just makes you wonder I guess whether or not they, * Seems as though this should be 2 slash unitsthe first ending after "beating."#Statement-opinion
Well won't,#Uninterpretable
well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that#Statement-opinion
but then#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then, you know, the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently#Other
and, you know, the#Statement-non-opinion
That's, that's bad .#Statement-opinion
other two guys sat in the car#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they didn't get beat up.#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
It ,#Uninterpretable
You know.#Other
Rodney got beat up because he, he, you know, he pur-, you know, he involved himself in some sub, self-destructive behavior.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, uh, just like the burning and looting#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is self-destruct.#Other
Everybody#Statement-opinion
Oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
says well this is the nineties#Other
and they're going to rebuild#Quotation
and it'll be even better.#Quotation
Hey, what do you think,#Rhetorical-Questions
you know, some, some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area?#Rhetorical-Questions
That's right.#Agree/Accept
With everybody with that mind set. They, they're#Statement-opinion
They're only going to suffer.#Statement-opinion
they're going to, that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto, you know,#Other
and you might even be able to, to use it for, for a bombing test site, you know.#Statement-opinion
T-, they're only going to suffer.#Statement-opinion
They, they've defeated themselves with, with their looting and violence.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or, uh, don't live there or whatever, we all saw the same thing on the, on the tape#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well e-, everybody is saying this is going to be a new era#Statement-opinion
and we're going to reexamine this thing.#Statement-opinion
Hey, the b-, the average person is going to take a look at that and say, suspicions confirmed.#Statement-opinion
They're a bunch of animals, you know.#Quotation
How can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything.#Rhetorical-Questions
Forty deaths.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean there are forty people#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
that are dead as a result of that.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's really ridiculous.#Statement-opinion
And I'm just trying to determine, you know, how you address, how you weigh, you know, Rodney getting, getting the hell beat out of him against, you know, forty deaths.#Statement-non-opinion
Against forty other people being,#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
And there's no other,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not su-, exactly sure, uh, what the circumstances surrounding the deaths.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths#Statement-non-opinion
Those deaths.#Repeat-phrase
and, and pursued it, you know, because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Is it a looter that got shot by a store owner?#Yes-No-Question
I, you know,#Uninterpretable
no tears.#Other
Or just a by-, an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what.#Or-Clause
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
and so I, but I,#Other
.#Non-verbal
I suspect a number of them.#Other
You know, you, you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot, you know, in, in the street.#Statement-non-opinion
Or, or beaten.#Collaborative Completion
And, and my reaction is I would have run over fifty people before, rather than stop.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, and there, there would have been just nothing but carnage after, after, after#Statement-non-opinion
Um#Uninterpretable
if I'd been at the wheel.#Other
No one#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
would have stopped me.#Other
That's, that's exactly how I feel too.#Agree/Accept
I wouldn't have, uh, they wouldn't have stopped my car for any, anything had I seen them coming.#Statement-non-opinion
But I was just wondering since you're, you're in, you're back east, uh, and a little closer to the, the bigger cities than we are in Idaho here.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
I'm inside the beltway.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know how capital gang, they always say well inside the beltway, they think thus#Statement-non-opinion
and so and I say well wait a minute,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm inside the beltway#Quotation
and I don't think like that.#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm a government employee.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In what, uh, section of the government do you work?#Wh-Question
I'm with the F B I.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, that's interesting#Appreciation
Yes.#Agree/Accept
An-, and so, uh, uh, and, and the reason I'm doing this whole thing is because Rick,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
whose another government employee wanted a spe-, segments of my speech,#Other
.#Non-verbal
that#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that were done a year ago#Other
and he wanted another collection a year later.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so this is my seventh call.#Statement-non-opinion
A year ago I did eleven calls.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see#Response Acknowledgement
And so that's, that's why, uh, uh, that's why I'm religiously getting on the phone because I have a unique, you know, I have a unique situation here in that if I don't participate,#Statement-non-opinion

Do you know anyone that, uh, is, is in a nursing home or has ever been in one?#Or-Clause
No.#No answers
But I, my grandparents were looking into it before#Statement-non-opinion
so I know what they've said.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Repeat-phrase
Well, I'm trying to think.#Hold before answer/agreement
My, uh, uh, wife's grandmother had Alzheimer's#Statement-non-opinion
and they were going to put her into a, a nursing home#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, they, when they put her in, she had all kinds of trouble#Statement-non-opinion
and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a, a, you know, a, a nuisance. Or worse than a nuisance,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean#Statement-non-opinion
Oh they thought it was too much of a bother.#Summarize/reformulate
she sort of went, you know, bananas#Other
and they couldn't, couldn't deal with her#Statement-non-opinion
So, I guess you need to, uh, know whether it's a, you know, a no deposit, no return kind of thing whether#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
If they're equipped too, to handle the kind of patients you're going to have#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
you know, put in there too.#Other
Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her#Statement-non-opinion
but they wanted to be independent as well.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Have their own room.#Other
My grandmother actually was in a, a nursing home that, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
there was a retirement hotel and then a, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it#Statement-non-opinion
so for, uh, the first few years she had her own apartment and, you know, made her own meals sometimes. But could, could also go and eat someplace else.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then, uh, as she became less able to take care of herself, then she moved into this other part that was able to, uh, provide full-time care#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, she didn't have to do anything anymore.#Statement-non-opinion
But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly.#Statement-opinion
And that's som-,#Uninterpretable
I don't know whether that's because they, you know, sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the, the reason is.#Statement-non-opinion
But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something.#Statement-opinion
Well a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They need health care#Statement-non-opinion
so they're already ill before they go.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's probably a large factor.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If, if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you, then you stay where you are.#Statement-opinion
Then you only go there as a last resort.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or people send you there as a last resort.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
That's what my grandparents,#Statement-non-opinion
it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened, there was somebody there for them.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that was their thinking.#Statement-non-opinion
Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time.#Other
I guess that's a problem too for people. Wait lists and all.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess.#Hedge
That, uh,#Uninterpretable
you can't always get in when you want too#Statement-opinion
and of course, you can't just sit around and wait.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
When you need it, you need it#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess.#Other
And the money is also another issue. How you're going to pay for it.#Rhetorical-Questions
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
At that stage of life you only have so much money left#Statement-opinion
and I guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean it is kind of fair,#Statement-opinion
but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise.#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's another problem.#Statement-opinion
And you probably, if it were you, you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
So, it, it's just so complicated anymore, I think#Statement-opinion
People outlive their savings.#Statement-opinion
And, with medicine being the way it is, you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down#Statement-opinion
and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing.#Statement-opinion
It's just a shame that's the way it has to be.#Statement-opinion
I think#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the retirement home idea's a nice idea. To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay#Other
and cause like if your spouse died, all alone, it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
To have friends.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I've known quite a few people that have, uh, gone to retirement communities.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if they have them back there#Statement-non-opinion
but here in California and in Ari-,#Statement-non-opinion

I'll let you go first.#Action-directive
Oh, well, what's there to say?#Open-Question
Doesn't seem like it's being carried out very well in my opinion.#Statement-opinion
Seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that I don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
I know what you mean.#Appreciation
Um, I,#Uninterpretable
in Maryland they, they do have capital punishment,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I've seen, uh, a lot of people get convicted, sentenced,#Statement-non-opinion
and then just nothing happens,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just endless, endless, endless appeals.#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well from what I underst-,#Uninterpretable
I saw a statistic just a few days ago, um, so far this ye-, year, or was it during the last year, somewh-, during a year's time, I think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation.#Statement-non-opinion
Meanwhile, there were twenty-five hundred people on death row.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So I, I,#Uninterpretable
and it's building up, you know,#Statement-opinion
they're, they're convicting them faster than they're executing them#Statement-opinion
so it's really building up.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, here in Maryland I know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
just,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
everybody's got that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but I mean, in,#Uninterpretable
here it's, uh, to the point where they were letting prisoners go.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, commuting the sentences of those that were in, in jail for lesser crimes,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in order to put more people in, into the jails.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was just, uh, amazing to me,#Statement-non-opinion
and of course they made a big deal out of the, the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and being rearrested an.#Other
Isn't, isn't Maryland where the famous Willy Horton case was.#Yes-No-Question
Uh, I can't remember.#Other answers
Refresh my memory.#Action-directive
It was, uh, that was the one that was used so much in the campaign. In the politica-, in the presidential race.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, may, it may not have been Maryland.#Statement-non-opinion
It may have been Massachusetts,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't remember.#Hedge
Um, I don't remember myself.#Statement-non-opinion
Anyway, well the question is, you know, do you think, i-, it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime#Yes-No-Question
or do you think it can if it's done right?#Or-Clause
Um, I think if they, if they started executing them on a regular basis, uh, that I think it might make a difference.#Statement-opinion
Right now,#Statement-opinion
If it,#Uninterpretable
I don't see it making a difference.#Other
I don't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death.#Statement-opinion
I mean,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
most people out there committing murders don't care.#Other
They just don't care.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well I think in large measure the reason they don't care,#Statement-opinion
it's not because the punishment,#Statement-opinion
but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The police don't catch them,#Statement-opinion
or the courts don't convict them,#Statement-opinion
or, or they don't serve very much of the time#Statement-opinion
and so, uh, you know, their, their success rate is very high.#Statement-opinion
Crime does pay,#Quotation
ca-, you can make a good living at it.#Quotation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
and there's, uh, there's a lot of people here in Baltimore that, uh, have#Statement-non-opinion
and we just had, uh, a real big cocaine bust,#Statement-non-opinion
and of course, you know, they're, they're playing it up real big that it was, looked like it was a very, very small ring#Statement-non-opinion
and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I mean, uh, Baltimore has, uh, an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year.#Statement-non-opinion
I think they've got over a hundred dead already this year.#Statement-non-opinion
Last year it was D C,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess Baltimore caught them.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, it's kind of, it's kind of moved up#Affirmative non-yes answers
and you have to remember that it, it, it, uh, there's, I think, X number of people out there that are going to commit murders,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, once you kill off a few of them#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that, I mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
the only consolation is so many of the murders are, you know,#Statement-opinion
the, the violent people going against each other#Statement-opinion
and so they, you know,#Uninterpretable
society's not going to put them to death,#Statement-opinion
well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to. Uh,#Statement-opinion
I think, I think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say, you know, this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society#Statement-opinion
and we are there by going to remove them from society, not temporarily, but permanently.#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, I, I personally think life imprisonment,#Statement-opinion
I don't think much of li-, of life imprisonment. First of all, it's never, turns out to be life,#Statement-opinion
but second, you know, why should we,#Rhetorical-Questions
the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole.#Statement-opinion
Well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again,#Statement-opinion
well then, why bother.#Rhetorical-Questions
Just execute them, because that's, that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So any, any, anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole, I'd say, uh, give them the death penalty#Statement-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you know, it makes sense, um, you know,#Appreciation
you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused, but I mean, uh, so few and far between, uh, you know,#Statement-opinion
makes good T V movies#Statement-opinion
and that's about it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and, and also, um, the, the thing I don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false#Statement-opinion
but rather it's on the rules of evidence, what can I hide and what do I have to tell.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and that way we can be sure, you know,#Statement-opinion
we can find out the truth,#Statement-opinion
we can find out what really happened and, and base the ver-, sentence on what the person did, not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I had,#Uninterpretable
my, uh, my father-in-law participated in a, uh, a jury trial,#Statement-non-opinion
he was, he was actually on the jury,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, this man was accused of killing, uh, I think it was two people, uh, and shooting a, uh, policeman, um, point blank in the face.#Statement-non-opinion
Of course he didn't die.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, this was during a holdup of a, uh, uh, a restaurant#Statement-non-opinion
and it came out during the trial that, um, they had tried to rob another place#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money, it turned out to be a couple cookies, and, uh, you know, jumbo cookies#Statement-non-opinion
and, and so they were so upset from robbing this guy, you know, trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started, you know, shooting people.#Statement-non-opinion
Just started shooting people,#Summarize/reformulate
You know it's,#Uninterpretable
because they botched the first job#Other
and,#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
so now they're going to get even.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and get even with who,#Rhetorical-Questions
I mean,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, stupid guys#Statement-opinion
And, uh, it turned out that the, you know, policeman survived to the point that he was able to, you know, identify the guy.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And of course, you know, they tried to make the cop look ou-, like he was, uh, a, uh, no good rotten drunk.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean it was amazing.#Statement-non-opinion
So what was the verdict,#Wh-Question
what was the results there.#Wh-Question
Oh, he was found guilty,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
He, uh, um,#Uninterpretable
last I heard, he, uh, he beat a push for the death penalty.#Statement-non-opinion
Now whether they finally got it or not, I don't know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I kind of, uh, stopped listening after a while.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, you know, he would come home#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, you know, after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on#Statement-non-opinion
and of course then they had to go back to dec-, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
after he had to go,#Statement-non-opinion
The, the penalty phase,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
yeah,#Uninterpretable
they've, decide the penalty separately from the verdict.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
And, uh, yeah everybody, everybody was pretty much, you know, let's burn him.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's, you know, that's the way they wanted to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
And he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
you know some people on the case were, were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges#Statement-non-opinion
but I mean when it all came down, they just, within an hour decided the man's fate.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, you know, you just have to decide, you know, wha-, yo-,#Statement-opinion
well there's really two separate decisions there I guess,#Statement-opinion
one is, did it really happen the way the, the prosecutor said it happened, you know,#Rhetorical-Questions
is this man really guilty,#Rhetorical-Questions
and you have to decide that,#Statement-opinion
but then you have to decide, you know, as a member of society what do I want to do with this guy who did this thing.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that w-,#Uninterpretable
I, I've never been on a jury,#Statement-non-opinion
I've never had that experience,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not sure I'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
well, it, it, it went pretty, pretty quick from what he said.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I mean there's, there's, there's a lot of other crimes out there, I mean besides murder,#Statement-opinion
I think, uh, now if you're dealing drugs now,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
caught more than twice or something, uh,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, there's, uh, a death penalty associated with it.#Other
Well the thing I'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, ye-,#Uninterpretable
I can handle people, people selling drugs, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it's, it's wrong,#Statement-opinion
but it, it's not worth somebody getting executed for.#Statement-opinion
But we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody, you know, these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the people I'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life.#Statement-non-opinion
That, you know,#Uninterpretable
you, never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree.#Agree/Accept
And so I go, le-,#Uninterpretable
these are the kind of people I would like to ye-, get out of here and get out of circulation and say I don't, we don't accept your kind in our society.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree,#Agree/Accept
I, I've, I have, uh, a low tolerance for that kind of, uh, that kind of person.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, as far as, uh, you know#Uninterpretable
there are some, some other crimes that I think, uh, you know, uh,#Uninterpretable
kidnapping, um, you know, when they,#Uninterpretable
I mean kidnapping per se has a certain, uh, uh, fine and penalty associated with it,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, um, some of these people are just out and out brutal.#Statement-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
some of the cases I've heard about over the years,#Statement-non-opinion

Uh, are you presently looking, uh, for a used car?#Yes-No-Question
Well, as a matter of fact, I just bought one#Negative non-no answers
Just bought one.#Repeat-phrase
Just, just within the last three weeks.#Statement-non-opinion
S-,#Uninterpretable
what did you get?#Wh-Question
I got a Lexus L S four hundred.#Statement-non-opinion
Lexus.#Repeat-phrase
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Which is made by Toyota.#Other
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
Lexus is a Toyota subbrand.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
It's kind of their,#Uninterpretable
I was wondering where that came from#Declarative Yes-No-Question
because they're talking like it was an American built car.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, it sounds like it, but it really isn't#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, uh, marketed, of course, it its own dealerships.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Usually, or somebody that's maybe got a Cadillac or Lincoln and Lexus dealership, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sometimes they do that,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, uh, a brand car,#Other
but I've really liked it.#Statement-non-opinion
It, it drives just wonderfully#Statement-non-opinion
and there is,#Uninterpretable
it's so quiet, almost can't tell the engine is running.#Statement-non-opinion
That's their big selling point, uh, other than general luxury#Statement-non-opinion
and, but the particular seems to be the, uh, the quiet ride.#Statement-opinion
It really is.#Agree/Accept
It's got pretty good acceleration, too.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's got a C D player in it,#Statement-non-opinion
so I can, I can play those#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Uh, was,#Uninterpretable
that wasn't a standard, p-, feature, was it?#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
But there is not very many options on that car.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There is only about five or six options.#Statement-non-opinion
Everything else is standard.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you get the impression that,#Uninterpretable
Uh, some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The C D and the premium sound system.#Other
Skidding control,#Repeat-phrase
you mean the antilock brake system?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
it's kind of a traction control, I think they call it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, it's not just antilock brake.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that's already on most of them,#Statement-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this is a, uh,#Statement-opinion
there is a further traction control, uh,#Other
Uh, probably suspension tied into#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
the brakes.#Other
And, and also the suspension can be raised for driving, like in the ice and snow.#Statement-non-opinion
It can raise the car's center up a little bit.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
For going under#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in Michigan or somewhere.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, shoot#Appreciation
Mississippi probably doesn't,#Statement-opinion
some of these muddy driveways could use it around here.#Statement-opinion
Mississippi probably doesn't have to worry too much#Other
No,#Agree/Accept
snow doesn't happen very often.#Statement-non-opinion
If it does, people go, what's this stuff.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, originally I'm from West Virginia.#Statement-non-opinion
We got a#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Response Acknowledgement
well, you had some there.#Statement-non-opinion
pretty fair amount of snow.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I got down here in June of eighty-four,#Statement-non-opinion
and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they'd seen in twenty years,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane, manly, adult men into playful little children.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I know.#Agree/Accept
We had this group of, uh, surveyors come into, uh, a shop I was working in, uh, four or five of them, these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place.#Statement-non-opinion
They had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked.#Statement-non-opinion
But, while they were there they set back drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
threw snowballs all over the place,#Other
.#Non-verbal
had themselves a ball for about an hour#Other
Well, the, uh, the Lexus, uh, really,#Uninterpretable
and the moon roof I think is also an option.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Although most of them are ordered them with it,#Statement-non-opinion
but there really is only about a half a dozen, uh, things#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
everything else is pretty standard.#Other
I did not get the traction control which also, when you take the c-, traction control and the and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Appreciation
so that's kind of,#Uninterpretable
You go out and get in that real cold car#Statement-opinion
It's a package deal.#Summarize/reformulate
and you turn that on,#Statement-opinion
and it, yeah, and it kind of, uh,#Uninterpretable
but that's only available if, with the traction control and the other option.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And those two are sold together#Statement-non-opinion
so you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to#Statement-non-opinion
Ouch.#Appreciation
to, uh, do it,#Other
so I, I opted not for that#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Appreciation
it doesn't sound real necessary in Texas.#Summarize/reformulate
And, uh, the dealership I dealt with, they order them all with the, uh, moon roof and, uh#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, nice floor mats and everything in there.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I worked for Lincoln,#Statement-non-opinion
So the only thing I had to decide on was whether I wanted a C D or not in the stereo system#Statement-non-opinion
and that was pretty much it.#Statement-non-opinion
And they had like three or four basic packages that they#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they offer.#Other
Sounds like the Lincoln Mercury dealer I used to work for.#Statement-opinion
They didn't order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got.#Statement-non-opinion
Little Mercury Tracer#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've been o-,#Uninterpretable
I've been,#Uninterpretable
imagine, or not, they make a, they make a luxury Mercury Tracer.#Statement-non-opinion

I've seen that in the dealership.#Statement-non-opinion
I was driving a Lincoln, a Mark Seven#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for the last four years before I traded it for this#Other
and, uh, I'm leasing the Lexus.#Statement-non-opinion
I usually lease them#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
since I own a business#Other
I just run it through my business,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it,#Other
the Lincoln ride is certainly good, too, but the, this Lexus is nothing like I have ever been in before. *#Statement-non-opinion
It's just,#Uninterpretable
Like sitting in your living room.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it really is,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's got a lumbar support in the seats.#Statement-non-opinion
Adjustable?#Yes-No-Question
Adjustable, uh#Affirmative non-yes answers

So, Jan, how do they recycle in Texas?#Wh-Question
Well, I,#Uninterpretable
the biggest, uh, way it's going right now, uh, lot, most of the grocery stores#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
have got, uh, things set up s-, where you can bring in your, uh, plastic, and your cans, and newspapers.#Other
And then they've just got different barrels setting out#Statement-non-opinion

whatever they're,#Other

Is it,#Yes-No-Question
uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is it all voluntary?#Other
Yes.#Yes answers
It's all voluntary.#Statement-non-opinion
Now, they do have some places where you can take things and get cash#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think the lot of people don't really want the cash.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, they just want to, uh, help recycle. Which is,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what we do. You know,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we,#Uninterpretable
probably the only thing, sometimes we'll take cash or the cans in#Statement-non-opinion
and we let the kids get the money for that.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
There's,#Statement-non-opinion
f-,#Uninterpretable
a lot of projects where the, the Boy Scouts and things, and that will,#Other

collect your cans#Other
and,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's a good fund raiser for the kids.#Other

but, but that's really the, the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know but,#Uninterpretable
I guess, I,#Uninterpretable
you see, I guess it depends on your landfill space.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know, I,#Uninterpretable
we're in Maryland,#Statement-non-opinion
but, my,#Uninterpretable
I from Pennsylvania *#Statement-non-opinion
and my parents how, are forced recycling,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Backchannel in question form
uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
really?#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
All plastic, they ha-, all plastic has to go into a recycling bin, all cans have to be recycled, all newspapers has to be recycled.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
Because they're, um, they're just running out of space and landfills.#Other
Uh, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York are some of the, uh,#Statement-opinion
they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, it's really, uh, it's, uh, really hard on them.#Statement-opinion
Now, up here in Maryland, though, we're j-, just in a voluntary recycling stage right now.#Statement-non-opinion
So, uh, so my wife and I, you know, we save our bottles,#Statement-non-opinion
and we save our newspapers,#Statement-non-opinion
and we save all our plastic, and all of our tin cans.#Statement-non-opinion
And just like you say, we go to, uh, a community area where they have it set up#Statement-non-opinion
and we dump them off there.#Statement-non-opinion
So, it's vol-,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
It's still voluntary,#Statement-non-opinion
you say it is all voluntary.#Statement-non-opinion
Do they,#Yes-No-Question
though I think, I think we're supposed to have something impame-, implemented by nineteen ninety-three, though#Other

Well, they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers,#Reject
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and stuff like that.#Other
But, you know, I think a lot of people, like I said, are more concerned,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with, you know, right now, you know, the aspects of saving the earth#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um.#Other
I think that's mostly,#Statement-opinion
well, you know, we,#Uninterpretable
even before,#Uninterpretable
as soon as the community said, you know, We're going to put up bins for recycling, you know, we automatically started,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
doing it.#Other
It was,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's one of those things,#Other
you know, and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
separated, you know.#Other
That's,#Uninterpretable
Well, I tell you, it's kind of funny now at, e-, even at T I, I don't,#Statement-non-opinion
do you work for T I?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
Huh-uh.#No answers
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Um, at T I they're doing recycling.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, for a long time they didn't do this,#Statement-non-opinion
but now they're, they're recycling cans and paper.#Statement-non-opinion
We have separate bins#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, separate wastebaskets in our offices#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for paper.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and they,#Uninterpretable
I mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's really,#Other
I can't believe that#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know. Because they've got it all posted all over the place how much,#Other
How much, how well they're doing.#Collaborative Completion
they're saving and how w-,#Other
yeah.#Uninterpretable
We do,#Uninterpretable
I, um, I, I work in a, uh, speech interface lab,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at a, at a, at a college.#Other
And we do basically the same thing.#Statement-non-opinion
The state of Maryland has lost, asked all the colleges and universities, and some of the large organizations, you know, if they would definitely recycle their office paper.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the same thing, you know, every, almost every college in Maryland is recycling office paper.#Other
But, you know, in the giant bins around,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's surprising how much#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you never realize, because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
can every night.#Other
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Other
You don't notice until,#Statement-opinion
you don't think about it.#Other
you start leaving,#Other
you know, they don't pick up your recycling until it's full#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you just can't believe how much paper that you, uh,#Other
I know#Appreciation
Reams of paper come,#Statement-opinion
Yep#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
out of an office every day That ,#Other
Yeah.#Other
Well, you think about,#Statement-opinion
took us to recycle.#Other
the waste, even.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you know, cost wise and#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, like you s-, saving trees and stuff like that.#Other
I mean, it's just amazing, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I think,#Statement-opinion
the difference.#Other
Hopefully, if,#Other
you know, I guess a lot of the large organizations, probably T I, did they advertise on television how successful they are?#Yes-No-Question
N-,#No answers
.#Non-verbal
I haven't seen,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
anything.#Other
Uh, but that doesn't mean that they don't.#Statement-opinion
I don't watch much T V,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, I haven't really seen anything advertise publicly.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then, like I said, they do a lot of internal,#Statement-non-opinion
Internal.#Repeat-phrase
advertising on that kind of stuff.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I haven't seen anything.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But see, I don't see a lot of T I advertisements on T V anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
I think they advertise more, um, other places where they're not located.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
That would probably,#Agree/Accept
You know. So,#Statement-non-opinion
be true.#Other
So, I don't see a lot of advertisements for T I.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, they'll jus-, come up and say,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, they'll show you tho-, to encourage to encourage recycling.#Statement-non-opinion
They'll,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
say,#Other
And here, those of us that Dumavra Power, which is our power company,#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that,#Other
we now recycle forty-five percent of our solid waste,#Quotation
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they,#Uninterpretable
and that,#Uninterpretable
we do this for the community,#Quotation
they put those on.#Statement-opinion
So I, so I think, you know, we're probably reaching a successful stage and, and just with voluntary,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think.#Other
Well, even, I mean, in the kid's schools,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean they do things to try and recycle.#Other
And, I know my kids, um, like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say, Oh, look at that. Somebody is not saving the earth, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I mean, the kids, I mean, they really try to educate all ages, you know,#Statement-opinion
and it's good to start the kids real young on,#Statement-opinion
I think so, too.#Agree/Accept
stuff like that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because, I mean, when I was a kid, they never did stuff like that.#Other
I mean, it's like nobody was concerned about it.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
We weren't,#Statement-opinion
You know, and it's like,#Statement-non-opinion
concerned.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
That's true.#Agree/Accept
You know, it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things, saying, Hey, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we're ruining the earth,#Other
you know. And now everybody is doing something about, which is good.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But how come we weren't doing this, say, twenty years ago#Wh-Question
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know?#Other
I, I think really probably what hit peoples, you know, I know that here in the, up in the, uh, uh, the, the New Englands area and also in, in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York, the, just run, all of a sudden we're out of landfill.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and they're saying, We estimate this landfill be ov-, will be full in two years unless we cut back.#Statement-opinion
And,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even then, you know, we're really running out of space.#Other
So, I think that, that became,#Statement-opinion
that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space,#Statement-opinion
Well,#Other
in some of the more crowded states.#Other
Yeah.#Other
This is,#Uninterpretable
So, what,#Uninterpretable
you know, and n-, no other state,#Uninterpretable
I'm sure Texas probably still has some landfill space.#Statement-non-opinion
They're not going to voluntarily say, Hey, ship your garbage here.#Statement-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you know,#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
That's true.#Agree/Accept
realistically, you know, we had, we really had to start, we have to start recycling in some, some, uh, geographic areas.#Other
It's really,#Statement-non-opinion
I think,#Statement-opinion
tough.#Other
that it, it really surprises me because of the cost savings.#Other
I mean, this is such a tremendous,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
amount of cost savings.#Other
I mean, why,#Uninterpretable
I can't understand why nobody saw that before.#Rhetorical-Questions
I mean, even, even not#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even the aspects of not saving the earth#Other
I,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
mean, it's,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, well,#Uninterpretable
so cost, you know,#Other
Well, in some ways, I guess, it, it doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it, you know. Because,#Statement-opinion
Bro-, .#Other
I know that, like in,#Other
yeah.#Other
Pennsylvania, they require them to, um, put their newspaper for recycling.#Other
But, the de-inking process that they have to, they use,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, is very expensive,#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and also, it w-, it produces a, a waste, a, um, a,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
liquid waste that they don't know what to do with yet.#Other
I see,#Other
So,#Other
okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even some aspects of recycling#Other
Is not#Collaborative Completion
they still have cost,#Other
real cost efficient.#Other
Oh, okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
okay. Oh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah, cost efficient, yet.#Other
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
I,#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Statement-non-opinion
understand that though.#Other
but others, you know, like tin cans and plastics,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
are, are really, uh, efficient, you know.#Other
They,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they melt on quickly and can be, you know, just because of the,#Other
and glass.#Collaborative Completion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
heating and things, getting glass.#Other
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, i-,#Uninterpretable
it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
That's true.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
And even,#Uninterpretable
I, I noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, I mean, that kind of surprises me#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you know, because once oil gets so, you know, thick and yucky, you'd wonder how they could, you know, clean that up,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
enough to use it again,#Other
but they can.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I don't know how cost efficient that would be, I guess,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I d-, I don't know either.#Hedge
That's,#Uninterpretable
I know that though, I, e-, all those petroleum products though are so terrible for your, um, the water table.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, they really pollute quickly#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, one,#Uninterpretable
, I was reading some place the brake fluid, you put, brake fluid normally comes in just small little pint containers.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That one pint of brake fluid can contaminate so many gallons of water,#Other
Wow.#Appreciation
you know, like hundreds of gallons of water.#Other
So, it's one of those things that they really,#Statement-opinion
um, and you wonder, you know, with all these oil spills.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
How, how terrible that is#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I know#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
how terrible that is.#Rhetorical-Questions
So, we'll have to, we'll have to keep our eyes on all that, I guess.#Statement-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know I really,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
I, I think that, I mean, I think that they really are doing a good thing now#Statement-opinion
and I hope it keeps,#Statement-opinion
well, I'm sure we'll keep up.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I,#Agree/Accept
You know,#Yes-No-Question
agree.#Other
I think it's really catching on.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, I, I think that,#Uninterpretable
I'm not sure if it,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
I think it's a good idea to make it mandatory#Statement-opinion
I do, too.#Agree/Accept
Um, it,#Uninterpretable
because like we were asking some people that live in, um, North Dakota, Well, are you saving your, you know, are you recycling.#Statement-non-opinion
And they said, Well, we're not forced to do it yet,#Statement-non-opinion
so no.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, so, I mean I don't know,#Hedge
I think that if people are forced, if the people are not forced to do it they may not, you,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It d-, ,#Other
know.#Other
I mean, I don't know,#Hedge
I think a lot of people still will,#Statement-opinion
but#Other
Well, you know, if they're forced to do it it becomes sort of a habit.#Other
Right.#Other
You know, I know that it's really funny.#Statement-non-opinion
My parents are forced to do it#Statement-non-opinion
and they,#Uninterpretable

Now.#Uninterpretable
I'm sorry,#Apology
Ready to go.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Uninterpretable
excuse me. And, uh, I do that,#Statement-non-opinion
we recycle, uh, newspapers.#Statement-non-opinion
We take, you know, the DALLAS MORNING NEWS daily,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the Plano paper daily#Other
and, you know, after a month of that you got a ton,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of newspapers.#Other
I know it builds up really fast.#Statement-non-opinion
It really does,#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do recycle,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
newspapers and, uh, glass.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We don't really have enough plastic to mess with,#Statement-non-opinion
we don't, you know, like we don't drink milk#Statement-non-opinion
and we don't have children#Statement-non-opinion
so we don't have, you know, six thousand plastic milk jugs,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we do,#Statement-non-opinion
a month, you know.#Other
With two, a two year old and a,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
three year old#Other
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it really builds up with us.#Other
But there is, you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different, uh, container.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, Plano has plans#Statement-non-opinion
I believe it's tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year,#Statement-non-opinion
the city is going to leave, uh, receptacles at people's home.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they ca-,#Uninterpretable
That would be much more convenient.#Statement-opinion
It,#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
certainly would#Other
and they can separate it#Statement-non-opinion
and then the, you know, trash guys will pick it up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which would really be handy, you know, for people like shut ins, or,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
people who can't or don't drive, you know,#Other
Or it just builds up so often,#Summarize/reformulate
they can't get to the these centers.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
And I'm sure rather than try to, uh, ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them, you know?#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I think that's probably a good idea.#Statement-opinion
They used to have several places, um, that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So finally, um, they, the people put so much pressure on the city,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they did a survey of everybody,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic, um,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and put it in front of the Wal-Mart store in town,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and th-, they, it just really,#Statement-non-opinion
e-, e-, every time you went by there it was just over flowing,#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
and so Wal-Mart complained#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so they moved it behind the store#Statement-non-opinion
and nobody knew where it was,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so people kept piling stuff in the same place,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where it used to be.#Other
Great#Appreciation
Oh, it was just like a dump there,#Statement-non-opinion
I bet it was.#Appreciation
and so finally, you know, I called#Statement-non-opinion
and the-, they said, you know, it was behind there#Statement-non-opinion
and I started taking my things behind there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So we do that with, because we have milk cartons, you know, constantly,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with two little kids,#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the paper,#Other
but it just builds up,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it would be so nice if they had it, you know at your home,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where you could just turn it in so they, they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in one neighborhood,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they have pickup there,#Statement-non-opinion
it's, uh, I think once or twice a week.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out#Statement-non-opinion
so they had not much participation,#Statement-non-opinion
and they were going to cancel it,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but then finally people started getting the message.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's just a matter of education, I think.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and I think that, you know, if they can get enough going,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they'll continue it, you know, throughout the rest of the city#Other
but it's not,#Uninterpretable
I think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's not going to be,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't think#Statement-opinion
yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think basically it's a good idea, you know,#Statement-opinion
I hope it works.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I do to because it's amazing, how much, you know, trash,#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
we can generate,#Other
absolutely.#Agree/Accept
I know this year we took our Christmas tree#Statement-non-opinion
they had a place,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the park where you could go have your tree shredded#Other
and they gave you a little, um, seedling to plant,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you could take the, the mulch home with you, you know, and take buckets of that home,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that was really good idea,#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I thought.#Statement-non-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
And there's just, you know, the two of us my wife and I#Statement-non-opinion
and it's amazing how much stuff j-, just the two of us generate,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
you know, I can imagine a family of, you know, four or five.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah#Agree/Accept
it's really,#Uninterpretable
it adds up so fast.#Statement-opinion
It really does.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
As far as new stuff to recycle, you know, I don't really, I don't really know,#Statement-non-opinion
I really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, they're working on diapers,#Statement-non-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
I was,#Uninterpretable
which would be great,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've read so many different things about diapers#Statement-non-opinion
and now their saying that e-, originally they thought the disposables were just awful,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but now their saying that they're, ther-, really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them,#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
and, you know, all different kinds of things too,#Other
so th-, the diaper service, trucks#Statement-non-opinion
apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and drop those off#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I don't know what's the, you know, right thing to do#Statement-non-opinion
but I really would hope that they would come up.#Statement-non-opinion
I know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but the landfill have to do something special, you know, for those,#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Oh, I'm sure it must.#Agree/Accept
Yes,#Uninterpretable
you know I'm not personally involved because I don't, you know, I don't have any s-, children that wear diapers,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I'm sure it creates a large amount of, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
It does,#Agree/Accept
uh, refuse.#Other
and you just feel guilty if you don't do,#Statement-opinion
That's right .#Agree/Accept
something with them, you know,#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
because you hate to contribute to the problem,#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
absolutely,#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
absolutely.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know what else they could recycle more of.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess we don't really use that many tin cans.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess there's some places where you can recycle aluminum#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in,#Other
I don't know if those are recyclable#Statement-non-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable
I think they're made out of aluminum,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
Yes.#Agree/Accept
There are, there is a receptacle, you know, at the centers also for aluminum,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but again we don't, we don't generate that much#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we don't,#Statement-non-opinion
we don't either,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we usually use frozen vegetables and things#Statement-non-opinion
so we don't really have,#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
much of that.#Other
that,#Repeat-phrase
ninety-nine percent of ours is newspaper and, uh, you know, uh, glass.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, now when we lived out in California they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or for aerosol cans and things,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like that because they say it's not safe to put those things,#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
in the regular trash#Other
Car batteries.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't, you know I don't change my own oil,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
so I don't, I don't, uh, don't have that problem.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well other than that I'm not really sure,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we, we try to recycle old clothes#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well we do to as a matter of fact. *#Statement-non-opinion
Our church has a place,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where you can take them#Other
and they, you know, pass them on to,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
other families,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
Yes#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we have one of those in town.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, our church each year has a,#Statement-non-opinion
one of their major fund raisers is, you know, a garage sale.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And there's a ton of clothes always, you know left over#Statement-non-opinion
and I take those down to the,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, it's called the Clothes Closet,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's what it's called here in Plano.#Statement-non-opinion
Kind of like a Goodwill, *#Summarize/reformulate
Right.#Agree/Accept
kind of place. *#Summarize/reformulate
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they distribute them to the people,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that need them.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's, that's real helpful,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
too.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I'm not sure I can't really think of anything else that we could recycle.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
I can't either#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I really can't,#Statement-non-opinion
um, no,#Uninterpretable
I, I really can't either.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, it was nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
You to.#Conventional-closing

All right.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

I,#Uninterpretable
you know, actually in this modern day and age, it seems like, uh, uh, we have more and more leisure time because, uh, we have so many convenience, appliances and whatnot.#Statement-opinion
We don't even have to cook dinner anymore.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
really.#Agree/Accept
Uh, but I, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I've heard, I don't know this for a fact, but I've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together.#Other
That ki-, the kids maybe on the average get, uh, something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents.#Statement-opinion
That's what I've heard too. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
It seems bizarre to me.#Statement-opinion
I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the, the worst thing that's happening in the world, at least the modern world today, is television.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Not so much because, uh, it's bad per se, although there is some pretty crappy programming#Statement-opinion
and I thin-, there's also some, uh, I think, uh, poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's so darned easy to turn the thing on.#Statement-opinion
I know it.#Agree/Accept
I've, I tell myself sometimes, just sit down after work,#Statement-non-opinion
So I refuse to have one in the house.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
Well good for you.#Appreciation
Good for you.#Appreciation
A lot of people, I talk to a lot of people about that#Statement-non-opinion
and I've thought about it myself#Statement-non-opinion
and I though about it a lot#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I still haven't done it yet.#Statement-non-opinion
Well that's good.#Appreciation
Well I'll tell you.#Hold before answer/agreement
Television sure makes child rearing easy on you.#Statement-opinion
I mean the kids can be a real pest, uh,#Statement-opinion
and turning the T V on is almost like magic, you know,#Statement-opinion
it's like sticking, uh, an electrode into their pleasure center#Statement-opinion
and you don't have to worry about them.#Statement-opinion
That's true#Agree/Accept
I've noticed that.#Statement-non-opinion
But I don't think it's too good.#Statement-opinion
I don't think so either.#Agree/Accept
Uh, so, you know, I don't know,#Hedge
I take advantage,#Uninterpretable
I don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids,#Statement-non-opinion
but I take advantage of, um, dinner time.#Statement-non-opinion
We always eat together#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, whenever you're with your kids, you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them.#Statement-opinion
Do you keep your kids, uh, active in sports or anything#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Uh, I guess our big outlet is music. Uh#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
our thirteen year old son plays violin#Statement-non-opinion
and our,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
nine year old daughter plays cello#Other
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
and, uh, when our son started playing violin, I took up violin#Statement-non-opinion
and when our daughter started playing cello, I took up cello.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So there's plenty of, plenty of interactive time in, uh, practicing. Although neither kid likes to practice.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I guess that's not a big surprise.#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
Not for kids#Statement-opinion
But I mea-, I imagine with infants you are, most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well#Statement-non-opinion
Although,#Other
I, I try and read to them#Other
and I take them to the park and stuff#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Oh, you know, reading is so good.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Other
I, uh, I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little#Statement-non-opinion
and I still try to read to them, although our son is not liking that anymore.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, they get to that stage.#Statement-opinion
Uh, but I read, you know#Uninterpretable
there's this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book.#Statement-non-opinion
Have you ever seen that yet?#Yes-No-Question
Sleep book,#Hold before answer/agreement
no.#No answers
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's called a sleep book#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, you ought to get it.#Action-directive
I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We've got quite a few of DOCTOR SEUSS' books.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I think, I think his sleep book is my favorite.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Well, yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like to, I like to do it#Statement-non-opinion
and they enjoy reading.#Statement-non-opinion
I've, actually I never read a lot growing up#Statement-non-opinion
and I never read until a few years ago#Statement-non-opinion
I just started picking up books#Statement-non-opinion
and so I've found that, you know, it's really important to me to get to read.#Statement-non-opinion
To, I like to get away in a book, you know?#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so I've put a lot more emphasis on that, on my kids#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So how#Wh-Question
to try and,#Other
much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day?#Other
Oh, I probably spend an hour or two.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh that's great.#Appreciation
My wife works at night,#Statement-non-opinion
so she does, uh, Tupperware,#Statement-non-opinion
so she's gone a lot at nights#Statement-non-opinion
and so#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I spend a lot of time with them#Other
Ho-, how old are your kids again?#Wh-Question
They're two and one.#Statement-non-opinion
Two and one.#Repeat-phrase
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so you have your hands full with them,#Statement-opinion
that's for sure#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept

Your turn.#Other
Oh, I, I start.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Agree/Accept
Well, uh, we keep a budget to an extent.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and really, i-, i-, we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm, I'm paid once a month which sort of, sort of forces some, uh, uh, restrictions#Statement-non-opinion
and you need to make sure all your bills are paid.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, about yourself?#Open-Question
Well, I have to say I really don't have a budget.#Statement-non-opinion
Both my wife and I, uh, grew up in, uh, families of rather modest means#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, our family income, at this point, is comfortable. Upper middle class I guess you might say.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, we're both so, uh, frugal that, uh, we really don't need a budget, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I guess that really is sort of, uh, keeping a budget,#Statement-opinion
you know. You stay within your, uh#Summarize/reformulate
Well we stay within our means#Repeat-phrase
but we#Statement-non-opinion
within your means.#Other
don't do it, uh, by conscious effort.#Other
It just sort of happens automatically.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Although we just moved to California#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, the cost of living here in California is, uh, I would say rather pathological#Statement-non-opinion
Yes#Agree/Accept
Uh, housing prices are, you know, like from four to ten times more expensive than, uh, uh, they were where I came from in, uh, Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you moved from Dallas to San Francisco.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
So, uh#Statement-non-opinion
That is a hugh difference.#Statement-opinion
uh, that presents a, a real shock#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Ac-, ac-, actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
But you have good sour dough#Statement-opinion
and it's a beautiful place to live#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
It's God's country.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and one way you know that is that only God can afford it#Statement-opinion
* Labelled as an indep slash unit since A's next turn is so voluminous before B.24#Non-verbal
Uh, so budget is not a problem for us.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, at least it hasn't been.#Statement-non-opinion
It may, may be at this point.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, up until this point it really hasn't been#Statement-non-opinion
When I, uh, was in, uh, undergraduate school a long, long time ago, I, uh, noted that the monthly salary, starting average monthly salary salary for engineers that, you know, in my discipline, was like oh, six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh. * See B.22 note#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I noted at that point that I was, you know, if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever.#Statement-non-opinion
So I stopped worrying about money.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it,#Uninterpretable
never have worried about money since then.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that, that's a system too.#Statement-opinion
Sometimes, uh, it's a bit of a, a problem, you know, because I guess I don't really manage my money the way I should.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of, of, uh, investments#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Well then again, you know, you said you, you are able to take trips.#Statement-non-opinion
And you do, obviously, have enough to live on#Statement-non-opinion
so I guess you're indirectly budgeting.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, just bye-bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal, uh, in spending the money.#Other
So, I mean that's, that's a form of budgeting I would think#Statement-opinion
It's, it's kind of a strange topic to, to try to, for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money.#Statement-opinion
Well, I guess we're both lucky in that regard then.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How big is your family?#Wh-Question
Uh, well we're, we have one on the way.#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Response Acknowledgement
Uh, my wife,#Statement-non-opinion
and then, we're, we're having one on the way in, uh, in, uh, September.#Statement-non-opinion
So how,#Uninterpretable
you, whe-, once you get ten children though, you may have,#Statement-opinion
No#Reject
I think it's just going to be one.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, all right#Response Acknowledgement
How about yourself?#Open-Question
I have two kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, one#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Uninterpretable
nine and one thirteen#Other
and they are beginning to be a budget problem but, uh, have not been really up until this, up to this point.#Statement-non-opinion
Do they budget at all?#Yes-No-Question
I mean do you have them on an allowance?#Yes-No-Question
I give them a, I give them an allowance#Statement-non-opinion
and they, uh,#Uninterpretable
I basically give my son ten dollars a week#Statement-non-opinion
and I put half of it in the bank#Statement-non-opinion
and I give, give him the other half in cold cash.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, he has a teller card so he can, uh, do what he wi-, do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank.#Statement-non-opinion
But, at least, it isn't, you know, burning a hole in his pocket.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If he wants to use it, he has to go get it#Statement-non-opinion
and that usually#Uninterpretable

Ok.#Other
Ok,#Repeat-phrase
I was watching the soap opera awards.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, it is really making me want to exercise#Statement-non-opinion
because every single woman in the audience is, uh, about ten pounds.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So. Uh, I started anchoring last, uh, anchoring, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
exercising last, about last Spring, when I, uh, joined the President's Health Club.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, I was really motivated and going,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I went, uh, for a little while, uh.#Statement-non-opinion
I went pretty regular,#Statement-non-opinion
but it is hard to go regularly for a long time.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And where I live in Waco, uh, they do not have anywhere here that is affiliated with President's#Statement-non-opinion
so now I do not have a club#Statement-non-opinion
and I am, uh, I do not have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly or something like that,#Statement-non-opinion
so I am not exercising at the time, at the moment.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I wish I could.#Statement-non-opinion
I wish I did have the motivation to get out and do that,#Statement-non-opinion
but I just do not like just running with no where to go#Statement-non-opinion
I just cannot do that.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Well, I understand that.#Appreciation
I have been trying to get myself motivated.#Statement-non-opinion
I had gone, gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
she had injured her back and needed a walking partner#Statement-non-opinion
and I thought that would be the time to get going.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so, we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, then she had to get back to work and which was traveling to New York#Statement-non-opinion
and so she is not around.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't seem to find time in the day time.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And of course, it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity.#Statement-non-opinion
I think a lot of the times, if you have someone to, uh, work out with, or walk with, or something, it does give you that motivation.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you can also, I mean you can, you know, pretty much do it privately if you had your own private, uh, sort of contest. You know#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
And that would keep you going.#Statement-opinion
Well, more than weight,#Uninterpretable
of course, I could lose, uh, lose certainly#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
from ten to twenty pounds#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I think more than that,#Statement-non-opinion
I also notice I just feel better when I exercise.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that is something that I am motivated about now because I do need to get myself feeling better#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just in better shape.#Other
But, uh, all the same it is connected to my attitude,#Statement-non-opinion
because I am not feeling as perky and good.#Statement-non-opinion
I am also,#Uninterpretable
it is hard to get my attitude to, uh, to get myself up there.#Statement-non-opinion
That is very true.#Agree/Accept
It seems like you walk quicker.#Statement-opinion
You just,#Uninterpretable
perky is a good word for it#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when you exercise.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I understand that walking is suppose to be the, like, the best exercise.#Statement-opinion
Better than running.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Things like that#Statement-opinion
cause it, it works everything#Statement-opinion
And you have#Statement-opinion
and it gets your breathing up#Statement-opinion
less chance#Other
and it doesn't#Uninterpretable
of hurting yourself.#Other
yeah,#Agree/Accept
it doesn't hurt you.#Agree/Accept
Like, I understand running hurt your shins or knees or something like that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
Last time I tried running with my daughter cause she is supposed to be jogging in P E#Statement-non-opinion
and it felt good,#Statement-non-opinion
but then I had pulled a muscle in my knee.#Statement-non-opinion
Actually, I hyper extended it or something,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh#Uninterpretable
Wow.#Appreciation
boy,#Other
I was suffering for about three weeks later.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
So, and I have never had that problem before#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I guess that age just starts to catch up to me#Statement-opinion
Uh, oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It is showing up in the weirdest places.#Statement-opinion
I guess my, my, favorite exercise, in the, uh, in the gym, is the bikes.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, is it?#Backchannel in question form
To go,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Yes answers
there are these stationery bikes that you just ride#Statement-non-opinion
and if you watch television, they usually have television in there or something, or if you listen to a walkman, it is pretty, it is pretty okay.#Statement-non-opinion
Again, that is sort of weird, because you, you, are not going anywhere#Statement-opinion
and, uh, I use to play racquetball#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I really liked that, because, you know, to me it had a point.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
You know, uh, there were points you could, you would make#Statement-non-opinion
and there was a point to it,#Statement-opinion
but running and jogging and just not going anywhere is just,#Statement-opinion
I don't like that,#Statement-non-opinion
I just can't understand that.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I don't do,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I have got a dog now#Statement-non-opinion
and, of course, she needs walking#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that is a little less trau-, uh, burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I can put on the earphones to have something to listen to#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know a lot of people just to be safe,#Statement-opinion
like you were talking about, walking at night and in the morning#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or early in the morning. Uh,#Other
you see a lot of, uh, mostly older people though but, that, uh, walk in the malls.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, like early in the mornings and things like that.#Statement-opinion
I have never tried that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know.#Hedge
You know, I have never even thought about it really.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That is kind of an idea.#Appreciation
We, we have, uh, over here in Plano, a little recreation center that has got, uh, a walking track,#Statement-non-opinion
that it is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it any time of the year.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I find it very tedious because I am watching the clock constantly,#Statement-non-opinion
and it#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there is just nothing else to look at#Other
and I actually get more tired doing that, than#Statement-non-opinion
I could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good.#Statement-non-opinion
There I could barely make a couple of miles#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that is a little less,#Statement-opinion

There we go.#Other
Uh, so, uh, what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary?#Open-Question
Boy, I, I don't know.#Other answers
That's a, that's a, a tough one.#Statement-opinion
Uh, uh, and it's, uh, I suppose it's, it's changes as, uh, as percep-, my perception changes of, of what, uh, I'm getting gypped on#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
That week,#Collaborative Completion
right.#Uninterpretable
this week or this month, uh, uh, uh, we're just, uh, going through, uh, uh, well, there's a couple of changes to the, to the, uh, our health plan#Affirmative non-yes answers
and, uh, and I guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If I step back I'm not sure I'd, I'd, uh, say that.#Other
What, what about you?#Open-Question
Well, uh, I, right now I'm in sort of a weird situation.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm a graduate student that, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
I don't have that many benefits per se#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, sort of get,#Uninterpretable
But, but, on the other hand, one of these days you'll be out looking for a,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
My wife has a real job#Statement-non-opinion
and I can see from her angle.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, uh, I think health insurance is real, real important.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've, I've, I've, I've discovered.#Other
I mean, even in my case it's sort of, they're really, uh, a pain in the neck about it up here#Statement-non-opinion
because the university makes me buy a small,#Statement-non-opinion
they, they have a mandatory, they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they offer insurance to everyone,#Statement-non-opinion
but then the basics that are major medical, they, they force you to buy here.#Statement-non-opinion
Now I'm covered by my wife's anyway,#Statement-non-opinion
but I still pay them a hundred dollars a semester#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for, uh, mandatory.#Other
So that's sort of annoying that I'm paying for something I'm not getting in that case.#Statement-non-opinion
I'd rather that, that went to something else.#Statement-non-opinion
And, and, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars a semester, uh, you, you never use because you just use your wife's.#Summarize/reformulate
Right.#Agree/Accept
I mean, uh,#Uninterpretable
and, and, and it turns out that actually, uh, the benefits they, you know, that, that hundred dollars sort of would, would entitle me to go to the university health services here, you know, and, and use them#Statement-non-opinion
and it turns out that I do think they're v-, they're excellent physicians there.#Statement-non-opinion
So, through my wife's H M O, we've registered for them as our primary care physicians#Statement-non-opinion
so we go there anyway,#Statement-non-opinion
so they're, they're, so if they were to bill, which, which I believe they don't,#Statement-non-opinion
but if they were to bill the H M O for my business, they could, in, in theory, be getting paid twice for the same thing.#Statement-non-opinion
But they're not, thank God.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, but anyway, uh, otherwise, I would imagine, uh, good vacation is, is important, although I don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job.#Statement-opinion
I don't, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, it, uh, the, the, that, that's a, a negative about, uh, where, where I am in that, uh, well, I came out of, uh, I worked five years civil service#Statement-non-opinion
and there it's, uh, if I remember right, you well, they, they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and, or hours per pay period or something,#Statement-non-opinion
but, anyway it works out as I remember basically to, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
you start at, at, uh, two and a half weeks or something like that,#Statement-non-opinion
and it, at three years, uh, it goes to four weeks I believe,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I'm coming up on, I've been at T I now, uh, uh, coming up on fifteen years#Statement-non-opinion
and it, and it just, uh, this year is going to go to four weeks here#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
Uh, uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that's really,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's a, that, that is a, a, a negative, but, uh, but, not, probably not at, probably not a deciding factor,#Statement-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I mean, I don't, you know, I don't, I know my wife, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I think she gets, you know, about two weeks a year, I guess#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off.#Statement-non-opinion
They, you know, usually let her,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that, that,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
that's, that's the thing is how, how flexible they are for comp time kinds of#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
kinds of things#Other
and, uh, uh, that's the, the, the, uh,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Uninterpretable
That's a, why it hasn't made all that much difference is because the, with the civil service, that you could take, you could take your vacation in increments of one hour#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, and, but, uh, there wasn't, uh, anything as far as comp time,#Statement-non-opinion
so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year, uh, you know, an hour here#Statement-non-opinion
Just,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Uninterpretable
a couple hours there kind of a thing.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, whereas, uh, here I, uh, things are free enough to, that, uh, the, the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that, isn't that much different,#Statement-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
That's, well, that's a#Statement-opinion
But, uh,#Other
that's reasonable, I think.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I think the, I think the health insurance,#Uninterpretable
I think that's, that's going through changes everywhere to, uh,#Statement-opinion
the, they've, uh, uh, gone through a couple years ago here where they, uh, will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals#Statement-non-opinion
and now they're in the process of developing a list of, of, uh, designated doctors, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
so that just routine visits, uh, they will compensate much better for, if you go to their designated doctors.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which, which, uh,#Uninterpretable
my assumption is that, that will not include my doctor since, uh, he keeps real busy without having to, to, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Weigh all sorts of other things.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
I think, I was watching something the other day about that actually on, uh, a news special or something like that#Statement-non-opinion
and they were saying how in some sense that, that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes, you know, lowers the cost of everything and all insurance#Statement-non-opinion
and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people, you know, don't get to, they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Well, and, and I think in the, in the, in the much bigger picture than, uh, to some extent hospitals and doctors have some, uh, fixed amount#Statement-opinion
and, if, if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to, to, uh, uh, give you, you know, give you these rates and make this agreement#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then, uh, you're not covered by that,#Other
and, and the added costs get passed on to you,#Statement-opinion
so#Hedge
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I'm not, I'm not sure,#Other
it, my, uh, one of the phrases I use is that, that it's moving towards, uh, private socialized medicine. That, uh, in terms of the negatives of, of always heard in terms of socialized medicine, you have no choice on who you, who you go to for a doctor and things like that, uh, where it's the government that decides,#Statement-opinion
here it's, it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
Least off, who decides.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
uh, and, but it, but it's the, the same, the effect is the same as the,#Statement-opinion
you, you, uh, get left out of the loop more.#Statement-opinion
I, I, I know that their, uh, idea is that, uh, if, if you have to pay a bigger share, you'll, you'll be more careful about spending the, spending the money and, and helping hold down the costs#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, I, I, I don't know,#Hedge
in terms of, in terms of, uh, the health care, I, uh, find that, that, uh, although I've, I've been lucky enough to never have any big problems, but that, that, uh, the cost is not a, a big factor.#Statement-non-opinion
I want to, I want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
get better.#Other
You want to know that, that, that when you pick a doctor, you know, you, you#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
could pick one who you could have some sort of a#Other
Yeah#Agree/Accept
and,#Uninterpretable
feeling about.#Other
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
that, that's the,#Uninterpretable

Well, uh, does the company you work for test for drugs?#Yes-No-Question
Actually, uh, they just recently started a policy of testing drugs, which was kind of interesting,#Affirmative non-yes answers
because w-, when I went to work for them, uh, they didn't do that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, since then they've, they've started a drug testing policy, not because of their own, uh, convictions, but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
How about you?#Open-Question
Uh, no,#No answers
we're not being tested for drugs at all, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
our policies and procedures manual, uh, the furthest it goes about drugs is in the, kind of the miscellaneous section, or#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's reasons for immediate dismissal,#Other
it says, use of narcotics on company premises.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
So that's pretty general,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I work for an environmental management firm#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I'm an engineer there,#Statement-non-opinion
but I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't operate any machinery.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now, people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
are under a, a medical monitoring program,#Other
because they're at a higher risk of exposure#Statement-non-opinion
and blood screening is part of that#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I think that drugs,#Statement-non-opinion
they do test for drugs in that capacity,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's not their exclusive,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just part, it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field.#Statement-opinion
What is the nature of your company's business?#Wh-Question
Well, it's actually, uh,#Hold before answer/agreement
we do oil well services.#Statement-non-opinion
So, a lot of our clients are oil companies, big oil companies,#Statement-non-opinion
and they go out to,#Statement-non-opinion
we have engineers who, uh, go out to the oil well, to the, to the client's oil well, and, and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
so the clients are very concerned that, you know, the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy, because they're on their, their, you know, territory and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
the thing that's interesting is that I w-, I'm an engineer and, a software engineer#Other
and I work in the software, uh, house,#Statement-non-opinion
and everybody there, you know, are all software engineers.#Statement-non-opinion
They've never, you know, they never go out to the, the oil rigs or anything,#Statement-non-opinion
and yet, we're getting, we're subjected to this policy, you know, the same one that, uh, th-, all the engineers have to, to,#Statement-non-opinion
well, a little different, actually,#Hedge
but, uh, you know, we have to go through the same thing,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, but it's, uh, it's a little different, I guess than than a lot of drug policies.#Statement-opinion
In our case, it's like, when you hire on, they'll test you,#Statement-non-opinion
and then if you get injured on the job, if you like trip and fall or something, uh, they give you a drug test right away.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first.#Statement-non-opinion
Particularly, like uh, we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol,#Statement-non-opinion
and tha-, they didn't find any problem with that, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Agree/Accept
Uh,#Uninterpretable
We, that's been an, a, an issue, uh, in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, they'll have these little parties,#Statement-non-opinion
and people will just get,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I've,#Uninterpretable
my brother lives where I work,#Statement-non-opinion
and I have many a time called him to come get me, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, uh, but, y-, you know, they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Other
but, uh, I think drug testing,#Statement-opinion
and I, I don't know,#Hedge
I guess I k-, I think it's got some relevance,#Statement-opinion
but I think its relevance is pretty limited.#Statement-opinion
I mean, I think, you know,#Statement-opinion
in your case, I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's really, it's really bizarre.#Statement-opinion
Uh, particularly, like where we are, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I,#Uninterpretable
there was a story of a woman last year who, who actually did slip on the ice and, and like sprained her ankle#Statement-non-opinion
and she, she was a personnel secretary#Statement-non-opinion
and she had to get tested#Statement-non-opinion
and, I don't know#Hedge
I'm ambivalent about the whole thing.#Statement-non-opinion
I, you know, I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand, it's like if, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
they're, they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense#Statement-opinion
and, you know, it's like you're, I mean, employments are contractual by nature anyway#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that, where I had to, uh, uh, do a drug test#Statement-non-opinion
and, and it's, it was kind of a long story,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was, it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through,#Statement-opinion
and it amounted to, uh, going in, uh, before any of these interviews,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not even working for this company,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm going in for, like, interviews#Statement-non-opinion
and they flew me out to Chicago#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, uh, before I went into any of the interviews, uh, they took me to the doctor to give me a physical.#Statement-non-opinion
They said it was going to be a physical, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, actually bec-, beforehand they told me they were going to, uh, do drug screening,#Statement-non-opinion
but I had forgotten about that,#Statement-non-opinion
and so, basically, I'd already peed off in that morning#Statement-non-opinion
and, and when I got in there, I didn't, I wasn't, like, able to give a full sample,#Statement-non-opinion
and so#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes, drink a whole ton of water#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again,#Other
and the, and the, the procedure is utterly humiliating.#Statement-opinion
You go in there with the doctor,#Statement-non-opinion
he makes you take off all your clothes#Statement-non-opinion
and then he examines you.#Statement-non-opinion

I, is, I'm not sure which one we went into,#Statement-non-opinion
it was about a year or so ago, when we went.#Statement-non-opinion
The one we went in had, uh,#Statement-non-opinion

That really seem, they really seemed to go wild in there.#Statement-non-opinion

and the kids can pet animals and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Where's that.#Wh-Question
That's on Plano Road,#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's a lot of fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Oh, that does sound like fun.#Appreciation
It's a little bit of a ways,#Statement-opinion
We take, you know, whenever we take them to Showbiz#Statement-non-opinion

they don't go for the food#Statement-non-opinion
they go for the, to play around#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they thought that was lot of fun.#Other
You can have birthday parties there#Statement-non-opinion

you don't have to have tokens for everything.#Declarative Yes-No-Question

Hi, Kay.#Conventional-opening
Hi.#Conventional-opening
I, uh, was thinking about salaries and benefits and#Wh-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, was wondering what's the most important thing to you besides a salary in a job.#Other
Well, um, I, we just recently graduated from Rice University,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we were going through a lot of job interviews and things,#Statement-non-opinion
and some of the things that were important to me, uh, when my husband was looking for his job, was, um, hours, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
we,#Uninterpretable
he'd been in graduate school so I was used to his not being home at all#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
So I was, you know, didn't want him to have a job that would make him kind of be on call all the time, and have to go in at any time, and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, even on the weekends and, um, and things.#Other
So that was important to me, and also insurance for the fa-, our family#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't ever want to have to worry about that.#Statement-non-opinion
That's real important to me.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, you know we have that, that Aetna#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's what we, the insurance that we have right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Us, too.#Statement-non-opinion
When we were in Colorado, they had, um, a different type of H M O there that I really liked a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was, um, not that kind of H M O -s where you have to go to their, their sort of like clinics, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but this was just an H M O where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular hospitals and all that,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was with a certain list of, of doctors that, you know, participated#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the H M O,#Other
and, um#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's nice.#Appreciation
you know, then you only had to pay the,#Other
for us it was a five dollar co-payment every time you went to the doctor, and, uh, three dollars for the prescriptions.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's good.#Appreciation
And, uh, I especially liked the prescription, especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That, those prescriptions can be very expensive.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I know.#Appreciation
We just went through that ourselves.#Statement-non-opinion
We just, you know, are like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I know,#Appreciation
especially if you get, what is it, Seclor I think that#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that just about breaks the bank right there.#Other
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it's pretty bad.#Statement-opinion
Well, yeah,#Uninterpretable
and we, um, we were interested in having dental insurance, too,#Statement-non-opinion
because, um, having been in school, we kind of put things off#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff#Other
and#Uninterpretable
Do,#Yes-No-Question
we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Do you have the basic plan or do you have the, the other one?#Other
We have, um, you know#Statement-non-opinion
we're at Aetna with an, uh, ex-,#Statement-non-opinion
we have like the medi-, the dental insurance is separate.#Statement-non-opinion
Is that what you mean?#Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I don't think it's the basic,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it's the other one.#Statement-non-opinion
The one that's like you get additional,#Statement-opinion
they'll pay a little bit more#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think for the different procedures.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We just have the basic right now,#Statement-non-opinion
and for most things it tends to cover it#Statement-non-opinion
We don't too many major, um, expenses at this point,#Statement-non-opinion
but we have been able to find do-, dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays.#Statement-non-opinion
A couple of times we've had to pay, oh I don't know, three to five dollars but#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's not that bad.#Other
No,#Agree/Accept
that's great.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
besides insurance, other things that we looked at, um,#Statement-non-opinion
well, my husband does not like to commute#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
very far,#Other
and, and we don't like him to be, you know, having to drive an hour to work or something#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
we don't like that either#Statement-non-opinion
So we kind of looked for where, where the, uh, his office would be located#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Is his office in Plano?#Yes-No-Question
well, he's at, you know, he's at the one that's at, um, seventy-five at, uh, six thirty-five#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so we, by living in Plano we're just about fifteen minutes away.#Other
Oh, that's not bad.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, especially when they finish all the construction out here#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we didn't want him to let, you know, to,#Statement-non-opinion
like we had some job offers in the New York area,#Statement-non-opinion
and we thought, well, you know, he would be really commuting#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes,#Appreciation
you're not kidding.#Appreciation
and not only is it, you know, trouble to have to drive, but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
And, um, so, that was something that was important to us,#Statement-non-opinion
and, because, like I say, we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that we were anxious to do everything we could to have, you know, made us be more together,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and what other,#Uninterpretable
can you think of another thing that you guys looked at#Yes-No-Question
and,#Uninterpretable
Well, those are some of the things that are very important to us too.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, we, we'd like, you know, other benefits that are provided, um,#Statement-non-opinion
the athletic facilities that you some-, sometimes take advantage of#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's, that's pretty nice,#Other
but I have to say that since we've come here we haven't done it too much though,#Statement-non-opinion
we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or, or any of that.#Statement-non-opinion
But that's, that's a nice benefit to have.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
That's really important.#Statement-opinion
Um, also, what, um, opportunities there would be for advancement, I think, we looked at besides just, you know, what salary you would be having now.#Statement-non-opinion
But when, when could, uh, your salary increase#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, is there, was there somewhere to go.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's, that's one of, I think, the hard things right now,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean they're going through some tough times#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to say the least.#Other
I know many of us are thankful that he still has a#Statement-non-opinion
job.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
that we can make our mortgage payments#Collaborative Completion
and, yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's really true.#Appreciation
Uh, one of the drawbacks, I think, of working for a big company, is often times, you do have to follow pretty rigid, um, guidelines,#Other
um, if, if an employee is especially exemplary, I think it's often,#Statement-opinion
in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say, Hey, you know, this person did a wonderful job, give him a big bonus kind of thing.#Statement-opinion
A lot of times#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
smaller companies have bonus plans, where I think in a large company it's hard to do that because there're just so many people to deal with#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you have to have guidelines, you know, for salary increases, and things like that,#Statement-opinion
that's one of the things that, that happens when someone, when you're dealing with a large company.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But.#Uninterpretable
But, we also were interested in, um, you know, being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that there would be some opportunity for friendships that way, so that you would feel happy going to work every day and#Other
Right *#Other
Rather than thinking Oh, I really, I can't stand these people.#Other
But, so that's something that was important to him, in thinking he could work under.#Statement-non-opinion
How long has he been in his present position?#Other
Oh, just since last summer.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's only been, not even a year yet,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Well, I was going to say it sounds like you, you picked out a lot of good things, you know, for him, to, to, uh, to choose in a position and have a lot of thought put into it.#Statement-opinion
In a big company, though, you also get moved around a lot#Statement-opinion
Yes, well.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some time.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or we may be having to drive to Plano,#Statement-non-opinion
you never know.#Statement-opinion
You never know,#Repeat-phrase
we're hoping that that won't be the case#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
We, I think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose, um, this area is that, um, my husband was raised in Irving#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so he, we have a lot of family here, his side of the family.#Statement-non-opinion
And being,#Uninterpretable
when we were down in Houston, we were isolated,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it's not that far, but, people would ha-,#Statement-non-opinion
we didn't have anyone in town that was our family.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And although we had really good friends and we had church and school support and things, um, we were anxious to move close to family members, just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We're very,#Statement-non-opinion
So, that really made a big difference, I think, in why we chose T I, and chose to move this way.#Statement-non-opinion
We're very far from our families,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's really hard.#Statement-non-opinion
I have little children,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, they were the only grandchildren,#Statement-non-opinion
and so, our, our families are, are really far away.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, this is a little off the topic, but yesterday, my mother happened to be on a train going from Phoenix to, back to Chicago#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it stopped in Dallas for half an hour, so I loaded the kids in the car,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and we went downtown, and met her train for half an hour, and brought her a little snack and an Easter basket#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Oh, that's nice.#Appreciation
I think it, it made her trip a little bit nicer.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it is, I think it is important to, you know, want to be close to your family#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and it's, it's hard,#Collaborative Completion
I mean, just for us to snatch a half hour like that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is a special occasion for us.#Other
So, um,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
that's the same,#Statement-non-opinion
it's nice.#Statement-opinion
way we felt.#Other
It's nice that you can have your family close like that.#Other
We're really enjoying it.#Statement-non-opinion
I wonder what it would be like,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I wanted to be close to family, but I also thought it would be harder to be close to family.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
sometimes it can be.#Statement-non-opinion
But it's turned out really good,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think that, you know, we're really satisfied with that choice,#Statement-non-opinion
and we, you know, kind of felt like, um, it was worth it#Statement-non-opinion
That's good.#Appreciation
to us.#Other
But anyway.#Other
Well, I, my children just ran out the door, so I need to go check on them#Statement-non-opinion
Okay#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I've really enjoyed the conversation.#Conventional-closing
Well, I have too.#Conventional-closing
And, uh, nice to have met you,#Conventional-closing
and you have a good day.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
you too.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Uh, go ahead,#Action-directive
tell me what you think.#Action-directive
Do we get our money's worth?#Yes-No-Question
Hey, listen, if I had my way, I wouldn't pay my taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
Not with the, not with some of the things that I hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
did you see SIXTY MINUTES last night?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I did not.#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
Well, they did a thing on the thirty-five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, it's staggering.#Statement-opinion
Well, how does this grab you? How did this grab you?#Open-Question
Uh, this,#Uninterpretable
I, I mean, I'm, I'm a lady,#Hedge
but this, I heard this on a Christian program#Statement-non-opinion
and it was, uh, about the N E A#Statement-non-opinion
and, that's the National Endowment for Arts,#Statement-non-opinion
and they fund, they funded this thing, this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, there are a lot of things that people, I think general,#Statement-opinion
And then it just frosts me terribly.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I think it's interesting to look at, uh, where the money goes,#Statement-opinion
and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
and I don't think generally, I think what's interesting is that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government#Other
and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with.#Statement-opinion
I believe that's true,#Statement-opinion
yes.#Agree/Accept
And that, what I think is going to be really interesting is what we do about it.#Statement-opinion
I mean, we are going to have to change the people who represent us.#Statement-opinion
That's correct.#Agree/Accept
I mean, and I think it's going to be real interesting to see and, and then force upon them, uh,#Statement-opinion
Heavy involvement from the public.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right that's#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
y-, I think that's the only thing that's going to change it.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
heavy involvement from the public.#Statement-non-opinion
Our anger is going to have to, to give#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
rise to, to more activity on our part.#Other
Uh, I've, I've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active#Statement-non-opinion
and in our society, uh, there's very little full employment.#Statement-opinion
Most people in this country are getting worse off, not better off.#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
Eighty percent of the public, according to Bill Moyers', uh,#Statement-non-opinion
recent, uh,#Other
piece for, uh,#Other
Public Broadcasting, which, by the way is a very good use of government money. I think P B S is wonderful.#Statement-opinion
But this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are, are seeing their real incomes,#Statement-non-opinion
and thus, standards of living, decline.#Statement-non-opinion
And twenty percent are seeing theirs improve.#Statement-non-opinion
That's not a formula for a better society.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
it is not.#Statement-opinion
It's lopsided, very much#Statement-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
And the government really plays a role in this.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's right,#Appreciation
they pull the strings.#Statement-opinion
I mean, w-, well, they are the people whose strings are pulled and by I guess powerful intere-,#Reject
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the,#Uninterpretable
yeah#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
You know, and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of, of the voter revolting.#Statement-opinion
But people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't#Statement-opinion
and they think it's unfair,#Statement-opinion
and when they recognize that it's their tax money, they're going to do more about it.#Statement-opinion
I th-, I'll tell you one quick, uh, one thing very interesting.#Statement-opinion
C B S, after the State of the Union address is going to open up a telephone line, an eight hundred number#Statement-non-opinion
and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They expect, opening it for one hour,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that they'll get three,#Other
.#Non-verbal
hundred thousand telephone calls.#Other
I'm sure they will.#Statement-opinion
And I've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to p-, create an eight hundred number for voters to call and, and vent their frustration with government.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like one, eight hundred capitol or something like that.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, y-, just a number you could call from anywhere, anytime.#Other
I think that's coming#Statement-opinion
and I think once, once people really start to communicate how they feel, things are going to change.#Statement-opinion
Until then, I think, you know, it's going to be really painful.#Statement-opinion
So the question is, how soon are we going to start to get our money's worth#Rhetorical-Questions
and, as you said, it's how soon we get involved,#Statement-opinion
and I think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved, like allowing us to call a toll free number and say, hey, look, do it this way, not that way, or I like this, or I don't like that, or this is how I feel about your spending my money on art that I don't think is art.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I understand that,#Statement-non-opinion
but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's the good thing about what is happening because I think more and more the news media, which takes a heck of a beating and, and deserves some of it, is telling us, you know, about the problems.#Statement-opinion
So the more we communicate, hey, look, we want a change here, because, you know, as it turns out, we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country.#Statement-opinion
Oh, absolutely.#Agree/Accept
Over a very long period of time.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
absolutely.#Agree/Accept
Uh, and, uh,#Uninterpretable
We only see the tip of the iceberg only.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, there's so much#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of it going on that it would really, you know, uh, set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture.#Other
Well, you may be right.#Statement-opinion
What I think is really going to be interesting is to see how, uh, we as a society deal with it#Statement-opinion
and I, and I think it is, what you say, it's, it's a,#Statement-opinion

Okay,#Other
what kind of car are you thinking about buying next?#Wh-Question
Well, what a wh-, what do we currently have,#Self-talk
I have a Subaru, uh, G O X T.#Statement-non-opinion
What year?#Wh-Question
Eighty-eight.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Well, I have a ninety Honda Civic,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm ready to get rid of it#Statement-non-opinion
Actually,#Uninterpretable
Oh, it's not pretty old.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
uh, well, I ha-, I had an eighty-eight that I really liked#Statement-non-opinion
and it got wrecked,#Statement-non-opinion
and so I bought a ninety, um, because I, I really liked my eighty-eight#Statement-non-opinion
and I've had a lot of problems with this one,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
So, you think their quality control's going down over there, kind of ?#Yes-No-Question
Well, you,#Uninterpretable
it's, it's kind of funny, um,#Hold before answer/agreement
I know a lot,#Statement-opinion
Well, I, I, I think we're going to see that I think, uh, that the quality that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit,#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
while American carmakers are trying to get their,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
put together,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
It's, it's true,#Agree/Accept
it's definitely true because,#Agree/Accept
But, but that's one reason#Uninterpretable
I, uh, I've had no problems with my Subaru,#Statement-non-opinion
that's one reason I went with it because I, Subaru had a good reputation, uh, for, you know, low maintenance,#Statement-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well, Honda does too that's why I was really,#Statement-opinion
Well, really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's, there's no question#Statement-opinion
but you have a nineteen,#Uninterpretable
I mean, I've got to see if ,#Uninterpretable
I mean, I've seen and I've had friends that have, uh, like, uh, eighty-one or eighty, uh, Celicas,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and those things just keep ticking.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, they just, they can rack up a, a hundred fifty K on them,#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
and they're still beating on them,#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
and it's just amazing#Statement-opinion
and then they got,#Uninterpretable
and you know they're not making them like that now, d-, d-, you know,#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
so,#Uninterpretable
not at all.#Agree/Accept
but they're still, they're still a lot, I think, definitely better than the American carmaker system .#Statement-opinion
Oh, I, I definitely agree with you there, because I had, uh, uh, uh, Ford T Bird before I got my Honda,#Agree/Accept
and it was the worst car I've ever owned#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, that's why, I mean, I was so tickled with my Honda#Statement-non-opinion
it was just a wonderful car#Statement-non-opinion
and then it got wrecked#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, I wouldn't even look at another car#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just went and bought a Honda, I mean, I didn't even, I didn't look around or anything I just said that this is what I want,#Statement-non-opinion
and I really have had a lot of problems with it,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't know.#Hedge
Well, maybe you need to unload it on somebody el-,#Statement-opinion
Well, I'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty#Statement-non-opinion
but in the first twelve months that I owned it, it was in the shop an average of about once a month,#Statement-non-opinion
it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's a lot.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it was,#Agree/Accept
I was really disappointed because I was, you know, so, hyped up on Honda,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Oh, well.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Anyway,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, what's your next purchase supposed to be?#Wh-Question
Well, I know this,#Uninterpretable
Oh, really ,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you had a choice of your car, what would you get?#Wh-Question
Well, it's, this is going to sound really strange,#Dispreferred answers
but I really like to have a Mazda M P V van,#Dispreferred answers
I really like those#Statement-non-opinion
and I have kids,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
I'm not sure I'm real familiar with the body style on that.#Declarative Wh-Question
They're a lot,#Uninterpretable
I don't like the new style, like of the Toyota van,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the, the new Chevy Lumina van,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't like those styles, um, the M P V is more of, uh, uh, just, uh, I don't know what you, normal,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know how to explain, more of an old fashioned type.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I'm not sure how to explain it,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean it looks, I guess, kind of like, uh, the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
no,#Reject
what#Uninterpretable
Astro, Astro, I guess,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay,#Response Acknowledgement
yeah .#Uninterpretable
is what it, something like that,#Other
but I used to really like the looks of the M P V because it looks more like a mini van rather than I think,#Statement-non-opinion
Do you have, uh, do you have a family?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I have a couple kids#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
well, that's probably influenced maybe a little bit .#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
definitely.#Agree/Accept
But, I know that it's got to have a radio, it's got to have air conditioning,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sure you can, uh, relate to air conditioning#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Oh, yeah.#Yes answers
Um, living in Arizona,#Other
but, and cruise control and tinted windows, that's about it,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it's got to have those things, otherwise, I don't care.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, when I bought my car, it was right out of college#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, you know, I always been looking for something sporty#Statement-non-opinion
and I ended up getting, you know, basically something that I could, you know, afford.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The only gripe I have is performance.#Statement-non-opinion
I probably, uh,#Uninterpretable
a few girls that I've gone out with, I've had, uh, like Mazda R X sevens and stuff#Statement-non-opinion
and they're, they're pretty fun to drive,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, I think that's what, uh, I, I'm going to have to get next time around,#Other
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
I keep, I keep hold-, holding off#Other
and then I could, I could upgrade now if I wanted to#Statement-non-opinion
but I just, I,#Uninterpretable
it's just such a huge expense#Statement-opinion
and, and, uh, I, I'm just going to keep holding off#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm definitely going to look for something, uh, in the, you know, nice, perpor-,#Statement-non-opinion
Sports car#Collaborative Completion
you know,#Other
I'd like to have a sports car too,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's not practical for me,#Statement-non-opinion

it sounds funny though, doesn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
anyway,#Uninterpretable
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, but I'll probably, um,#Other
it just depends,#Statement-non-opinion
I know that's what I want,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't know if I'll get myself to spend that kind of money,#Statement-non-opinion
you're looking at, you know, for a new R X seven or, a Supra or something,#Statement-opinion
you're looking at twenty-five K or something,#Statement-opinion
Oh, at least,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
that like#Other
and so,#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Statement-opinion
anyway but,#Other
well, new cars aren't cheap anyway,#Other
but,#Uninterpretable
Anyway my ultimate car though, the, the one that I really want is, uh, five sixty or so, Mercedes,#Other
so,#Uninterpretable
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
maybe someday#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
we have, we all have those kind of dreams too, don't we?#Yes-No-Question

What I'd really like to have#Uninterpretable
That's the only one that I, you know,#Statement-non-opinion

It may be my phone, um,#Statement-opinion
anyway it's the only car that says, you know, sporty and class, uh,#Statement-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you're right#Agree/Accept

uh, kind of what I'm,#Uninterpretable

they're, they're cute cars#Statement-opinion

well, he did, he had a, a red Miata,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, he actually,#Uninterpretable
they came out with a European racing, green, uh, Miata that's a limited edition,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're only going to make like three or four thousand.#Statement-non-opinion
So, he went out#Statement-non-opinion
and he traded the other one in and got this one,#Statement-non-opinion
Wow, I haven't seen those.#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm like, um , but, uh, I haven't seen one yet either#Statement-non-opinion
but supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel,#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
so, it's, it's very authentic#Statement-non-opinion
and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be, may be a good investment.#Statement-opinion
If it,#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
definitely.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If it's a limited edition usually, no matter what it is, if it's a limited edition, it's usually worth something later on.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
But, uh, I think#Uninterpretable
hello,#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
okay,#Response Acknowledgement
yeah,#Uninterpretable
I got off my pace or my cordless phone,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
anyway, uh, hope it's not going bad,#Other
it's going to bump me out.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, but he, I think he, he only spent, you know, the low twentys#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Hedge
Really?#Backchannel in question form
I don't know.#Other
Now, see, I would have never figured that, I would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that's limited edition.#Statement-opinion
Well, I don't know,#Hedge
I think the demand's gone all, down a little bit.#Statement-non-opinion
I think you can,#Statement-non-opinion
the prices aren't as high, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and the, the mu-, Miata was first introduced, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
And, well , they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they?#Yes-No-Question
Wh-,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Yes answers
the demand is so, high that, uh, you know, they were going to retail them around like thir-, you know, thirteen standard, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and you get your options,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
your looking at fifteen or si-,#Other
That's true.#Agree/Accept
fifteen#Other
but there were, you know, people were buying them for nineteen and twenty,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
they, they may have gone down a little bit#Other
but I,#Uninterpretable
they're still pretty much in demand.#Statement-non-opinion
I think there's another car coming in,#Statement-non-opinion
it's supposed to come out and compete with that Miata,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I can't remember what I read about that#Statement-non-opinion
but so, that's ,#Uninterpretable
I mean, I would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular,#Statement-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it really is.#Agree/Accept
But,#Uninterpretable
Have you seen the new, uh, Dodge Stealth?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, yeah.#Yes answers
The, the,#Other
yeah,#Yes answers
and the Mitsubishi,#Statement-opinion
real nice one#Other
three thousand G T ,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is the same, same.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
the Mitsubishi is real nice looking too,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well, that's, that's,#Statement-non-opinion
now those are nice#Statement-opinion
that's the same manufacturer#Other
and st-,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so , they just market them.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
those are and those are supposed to be very performance power, I mean, they're,#Statement-non-opinion
The expensive ones,#Statement-non-opinion
there is, yeah, big time.#Other
they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand,#Other
but those are pretty stripped,#Statement-non-opinion
and there's nothing,#Statement-non-opinion
there's really,#Uninterpretable
that one's just more for looks, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it doesn't have any, really the performance that the expensive one does.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, but I've seen one of those,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's not that great, I mean, because they really,#Statement-non-opinion
I think the-, they're only around, uh, twenty-nine K.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the-,#Uninterpretable
like, I mean they have, um, better ,#Statement-non-opinion
it's not quite as nice for a little bit less.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
they're not really that bad#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't know,#Hedge
like I said it's, it's still not practical for me#Statement-non-opinion
I have a hard time looking at cars like that because I think, now, there's no way I can do that#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm being single#Statement-non-opinion
and no other responsibilities for yourself, I guess, you know, it's, I can,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can, I've been pretty happy,#Other
I've, I've, haven't tried to upgrade myself right now,#Statement-non-opinion
that's, uh, you know, I could, I could have, you know, get something nice and upgrade#Statement-non-opinion
but I just, uh, I'm consulting right now,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
I just made my first job hop about eight months ago,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
uh ...#Uninterpretable

Okay,#Other
we're rolling.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh,#Uninterpretable
what, what would you, what would, has your experience lead you to advise, uh, if my child were thinking of going to the Air Force Academy,#Wh-Question
what would you say?#Wh-Question
Well, I'd encourage it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's a good general e-, ed-, education for a, a bachelor's degree.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And obviously, and obviously it's where they don't have a, any post graduate program there,#Statement-non-opinion
but you get a, an excellent, wide, uh, basis of topics.#Statement-opinion
You know, you get a good broad education out of it.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You don't, they don't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors, but#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there.#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh,#Uninterpretable
How do you feel about,#Open-Question
it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college.#Statement-opinion
How does that, uh,#Wh-Question
how do you feel that is for someone at, at that phase in their life?#Wh-Question
Well, the for some people, it's good because they maybe they need a little discipline, need a little reining in at that, that stage in their life.#Statement-opinion
Uh, other people,#Uninterpretable
it, uh, it's, uh, suffocating,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, you kind of choke on it#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, it, it depends on the person,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on the individual,#Other
but, uh, the one factor I think more than anything else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just the, the cost of, how much you're going to pay#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
no matter where you go to school.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And if you've been in for twelve years, I'm sure you've,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you've got a, your share of student loans that, uh, you're probably going to be paying off or have been#Other
or,#Uninterpretable
Well, I sort of,#Statement-non-opinion
one of the reasons it's taken so long is I've been working all, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sort of half student, half working and source of income and stuff,#Other
so I'm actually managing to do this with zero debt.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's good.#Appreciation
Uh, I couldn't, you couldn't do it otherwise.#Statement-opinion
Oh, y-, I mean I know people that graduated, or that I went to high school with that went to civilian colleges#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they've got twenty, thirty thousand dollar debts,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean you could have, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think if there's any major piece of advice I'd give, is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's not,#Uninterpretable
I mean, I remember seeing an article one time about, you know, if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a, a, in an investment fund, they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the job they'd get after college.#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
So, it's, it's really kind of crazy.#Statement-opinion
It's, it's staggering when you think that, just here in central New York, is, uh,#Statement-opinion
Hamilton College is just a few miles south of, you know, maybe about twenty miles to the south from where I am#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, they're looking for twenty-two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
A year.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
At just a small,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean they, they, they are s-, it is a select,#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes,#Agree/Accept
I know.#Statement-non-opinion
college.#Other
I was actually, I th-, I was thinking of trying to get a job there#Statement-non-opinion
I heard of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, you're talking incredible tuitions now.#Statement-opinion
Uh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot.#Statement-non-opinion
Very few I would imagine.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I get,#Uninterpretable
I just couldn't ima-,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it's more money that I make in a year,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
You know, it, you know,#Uninterpretable
me being one person with a above the median income,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for New York state, you know,#Other
I'm a s-, I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now,#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I,#Other
even as a somebody making twice what I was making, how could you put half of that into,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to your child's education#Other
and then just when they make, made, make it to the college years it's,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My God, I can't imagine.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, my, my real feeling about, about the purpose of undergraduate education is it's really the time,#Statement-opinion
yes,#Other
you do get an education, you do learn some things,#Statement-opinion
but you eventually forget most of it.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
But what you don't forget is the growing up.#Statement-opinion
It's really the period when people become adults.#Statement-opinion
I mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways.#Statement-opinion
But, really,#Uninterpretable
it's the entry into adulthood, I think.#Statement-opinion
And I think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to be fostered in as you become, you know, as you gain new social skills, as you become, you know, more of a functioning member of society.#Statement-opinion
And maybe the Air Force Academy is a perfect,#Statement-opinion
as you said for someone who, you know, a more, you know, who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them.#Statement-opinion
Or, it's also a good environment,#Statement-opinion
it may be good for someone who already has self discipline, who has a certain amount of leadership quality in their own,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that,#Other
and want to develop that.#Collaborative Completion
And, that,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Agree/Accept
the s-,#Uninterpretable
it's the same.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It can benefit different people different ways.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, you know, I, I agree with that, because I see people that I know f-, again, from high school,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that I still keep in touch with,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that didn't go to college#Other
and they do the same old things they did in high school and,*#Statement-non-opinion
The same patterns of behavior, you mean?#Tag-Question
Same patterns of behavior,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
same, uh, same socializing, same exact crowd that they hang with#Other
and it's like, it's like frozen time, you know.#Statement-opinion
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
it's ki-, I find it kind of sad,#Statement-opinion
I really do.#Statement-non-opinion
It is.#Agree/Accept
It really is that they haven't found anything, anything better that, uh,#Statement-opinion
or their, their experiences haven't been broadened at all,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to, to you know, you know,#Other
it's, it's a, it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a, in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions#Statement-opinion
and you hear all these different sides of the story#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you never thought of#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, that's another big thing I think people get out of college is the appreciation for different point, differing points of view,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, or different opinions.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
exactly,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
the, the one thing I think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions.#Statement-opinion
These institutions of th-, thirty thousand students and such.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh I,#Uninterpretable
And I see some freshmen wandering around in there#Statement-non-opinion
and they're they're just like, you know, someone from the country lost in the big city,#Statement-opinion
I mean,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they, they,#Other
I don't see them getting,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean when I was undergraduate, I went to a, relatively small school for my first two years#Statement-non-opinion
and then I transferred to a very large school.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that worked out pretty well.#Statement-non-opinion
I went from a, you know, a second rate institution to a higher rate institution.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was.#Statement-non-opinion
I needed to make friends.#Statement-non-opinion
I needed to sort of learn the ropes.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, there were things like that, that mattered a lot more#Statement-non-opinion
and I needed basic, really simple education that you can get, pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, your education's a lot what you make of it, too,#Statement-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
And if you're alienated,#Uninterpretable
I mean I see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having psychological problems,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, you think this isn't sinking in.#Other
Well, I, I've seen more graduates from M I T#Statement-non-opinion
and that,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
being,#Uninterpretable
I work in a, in a labora-, an Air Force laboratory#Statement-non-opinion
and so we've got a lot of, uh, M I T graduates that are in there#Statement-non-opinion
and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that I think I've ever run into.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Even, even more so, uh, like, military academy grads are a strange lot, too,#Statement-opinion
I, I mean I have to ad-, confess to that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's sort of a, a rare select environment.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they have their own quirks and tolerances and,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know, certain things that don't bother us at all,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that would drive other people nuts#Other
and then certain things that#Statement-non-opinion
ways, things we do,#Statement-non-opinion
the way we do it that drive other people nuts that,#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right,#Agree/Accept
sure.#Agree/Accept
But, these M I T grads are off in their absolute own world.#Statement-opinion
It, it's a,#Uninterpretable
I, I have more re-, I have a lot of respect for M I T master's and doctorate, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's a top rated institution#Statement-non-opinion
and now I,#Uninterpretable
degrees,#Other
but they're undergrads are like,#Statement-opinion
I, I'm amazed, at, at that's a lot of them even graduated.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I don't know.#Hedge
Well, I, I had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Not realizing that the reputation for M I T is because of the, of the doctorate research,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the professors who go there,#Other
and you're not going to see the professors#Statement-non-opinion
Nope.#Agree/Accept
you know, you're going to see some T A, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, so they p-, they, they want, you know, they want the best#Statement-opinion
and they don't think, they think what the best is, is,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
reputation for, for research#Other
and that's a one standard,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's not relevant,#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
to what they need.#Other
It's interesting that you mention,#Statement-opinion
and I didn't think about that before when you were talking,#Statement-non-opinion
but the service academies have all, all the faculty, uh, for the most part is, is military with a few exchange,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
instruct-, professors from other,#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
schools.#Other
But, uh, having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there, uh, is investing in the Air Force,#Statement-opinion
and it,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or the, the military itself, it's the future officer corps#Statement-non-opinion
and so, I hear hor-, horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors,#Statement-non-opinion
they could never get extra help.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
For me any time I needed extra help any time of the day#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I had all my instructors home phone numbers#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and could call them,#Statement-non-opinion
you go to their office anytime.#Statement-non-opinion
I had some instructors that, uh, would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
when I was having trouble with something#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you won't get that at M I T or virtually or anything like that.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
no,#Agree/Accept
and that,#Uninterpretable
And you c-, you know, and you can't blame the professors either,#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
because you look at their job description,#Other
you'd s-, you know,#Uninterpretable
teaching is third down on the list of importance things#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
Publish first,#Action-directive
and the#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research, because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I'd say go to a, go to a college that has teachers.#Statement-opinion
People who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, oh, well#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, there's a lot of factors that people don't ever, ever consider#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in, in their selection of a college#Other
and, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
maybe, I wonder if, if they enter these conversations that people have been having, uh ...#Statement-non-opinion

about the weather#Other
Oh, yes,#Agree/Accept
very appropriate, I guess.#Statement-opinion
Uh, you ready for this?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Okay, John,#Response Acknowledgement
just a moment.#Action-directive
Well, guess what,#Action-directive
we get to talk about the weather#Statement-non-opinion
The weather is, uh, this time of year has actually been kind of unusual.#Statement-opinion
I haven't expected it to be colder until, you know#Statement-non-opinion
like we've gotten the last couple of days.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know.#Hedge
I fly for a living,#Statement-non-opinion
and I've, uh,#Uninterpretable
the weather's been terribly unusual every where I've been.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you do#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
so you, you, you probably go everywhere#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
and have all sorts of weather.#Other
I imagine it's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, it was around here last night,#Affirmative non-yes answers
I'll tell you that#Statement-non-opinion
Well, actually I'm, I'm, I've heard on the news that we, uh, will be setting a record here in the State of Texas for the, uh, large amounts of rain and moisture we've had this year, that it's going to break all kind of records that were set, set, set back since nineteen thirty-two.#Statement-non-opinion
No kidding.#Backchannel in question form
So, yeah#Yes answers
Um.#Uninterpretable
If it keeps on raining like this,#Statement-non-opinion
and I understand it's supposed to rain until Saturday night.#Statement-opinion
Saturday or Sunday they were saying,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Oh, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know the systems have been real strong out.#Statement-non-opinion
I went through, uh, Phoenix on, twice on, uh, Wednesday morning#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, approaches to low minimum both, both times#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather#Statement-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
And so are you an airline pilot?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
I am#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, great.#Appreciation
for Southwest,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
For Southwest,#Repeat-phrase
fantastic.#Appreciation
I have a brother, I have a brother that's a pilot, also, with American.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, is that right?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
So I imagine you, uh, oh, with all this kind of weather it, uh, makes it kind of dangerous for you.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, now, I wouldn't call it danger.#Negative non-no answers
This is, uh, this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in.#Statement-non-opinion
This is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the Springtime.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I guess so,#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
the, the air systems are reasonably calm.#Statement-non-opinion
We don't have, uh, the turbulence#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
have a, uh, little bit of chop,#Other
but it's not like it is in the spring time.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
Well, we moved actually down here from another location,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's spectacular the, the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time, the torrents of rain.#Statement-opinion
Spectacular is the right word for them.#Agree/Accept
Pardon me?#Signal-non-understanding
Spectacular is a good word for them#Agree/Accept
I've never seen a thunder show like I've seen down here before in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
It's amazing.#Statement-opinion
Lights up the whole sky and even on a, on a,#Statement-non-opinion
actually I've, I've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky,#Statement-non-opinion
it's a cloudless night,#Statement-non-opinion
and the rain isn't falling,#Statement-non-opinion
but you can see the thunder, and, excuse me, see the lightening going horizontally across the sky#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
and back and forth, and what a light show.#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, it's fabulous.#Statement-opinion
cloud to cloud it can be real, really sensational here.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Statement-opinion
Where are you from originally?#Wh-Question
I'm from, uh, northern Utah,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's a very arid climate, from, uh, Salt Lake City area#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and there's always a lot of snow.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, where I grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to, uh, twelve different major ski resorts,#Statement-non-opinion
and so#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there was an awful lot of snow,#Other
and because it was an arid climate, the snow was always a crisp, powder, light snow#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which made it fantastic for skiing and, and sleigh riding and everything else.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, we had a great time.#Statement-non-opinion
Were you near, near the Park Cities area.#Yes-No-Question
Um, yeah,#Yes answers
in, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Beautiful area.#Statement-opinion
in Snowbird and Solitude and#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and Brighton and yes,#Other
.#Non-verbal
all those areas.#Other
So I imagine, have you skied before?#Yes-No-Question
Well, we've skied,#Affirmative non-yes answers
I have not skied that area.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Response Acknowledgement
I've driven through it several times.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I skied, we skied California a bunch when we lived out there,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, um, and, of course, grew, we grew up in Minnesota,#Other
and we do some skiing there#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
lot of cross country skiing there.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
great.#Appreciation
Well, do you think this, the, the weather is typical for this time of the year?#Yes-No-Question
Well, not really,#Negative non-no answers
.#Non-verbal
I, you know,#Uninterpretable
Minnesota's gotten just hammered with snow, um,#Statement-non-opinion
the, um, uh,#Uninterpretable
we've gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
I think#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the temperatures that we've got today, you know, that moved in last night.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's been, it's been cold.#Statement-opinion
There was a time, though, in the, uh, middle part of November that got really cool, really, really#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
unseasonably cool#Other
Yes,#Agree/Accept

and I thought, great#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's, that's a fun th-,#Statement-opinion

my wife was just listening here#Statement-non-opinion
and she said, yeah,#Statement-non-opinion
it froze in fact.#Quotation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was, it was real cold.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
but that was very unseasonable for us down here.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, but, uh, I've really enjoyed the weather down here, too,#Statement-non-opinion
because, uh, two years ago we were the day after Christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weat-, weather,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's not as severe, I should say#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as the weather that I've experienced up in northern Utah.#Other
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's, that's real true.#Statement-opinion
Same with us from Minnesota.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, it's, uh,#Uninterpretable

Oh, it is,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Agree/Accept
and the wind and the blowing snow and everything.#Other
Well, and they've had, uh, you know,#Uninterpretable
usually in Minnesota they get their snow in January#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and February,#Other
and they're up over sixty-five or sixty-,#Statement-non-opinion

Uh, well, let's see.#Other
How many,#Wh-Question
you said yours are all,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, that sounds like an army.#Statement-opinion
Five.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, lord.#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
That is an army,#Statement-opinion
I came from a family of six,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and I have only got two,#Statement-non-opinion
and they are, one ...#Statement-non-opinion
Well any number is nice, let me tell you.#Statement-opinion
Well, I kind of decided that single, single children that, that, that's not parenting,#Statement-opinion
that's a hobby.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But,#Uninterpretable
It's not as fair to the children either, I do not think.#Statement-opinion
Well, do not tell that to all my friends.#Action-directive
.#Non-verbal
They are into quality time.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I am into getting through the day.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too.#Statement-opinion
Well I, I, I can spot a kid who really, you know, whose parents spend every,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
quality time with them, you know, outside of the work day.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And when I take care of some people's kids,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
when they, when they have teachers' holidays,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that kind of stuff, I will take my friends' kids,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that are usually in day care,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you can spot them,#Statement-opinion
You can tell.#Agree/Accept
because they have no idea how to hang out and mess around.#Other
How to just entertain themselves.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's a problem for any child#Statement-opinion
and you take one that's used to being, uh, busy being, having something to do all the time, it makes a big difference.#Statement-opinion
It's not a problem for my two,#Statement-non-opinion
they are only eighteen months apart#Statement-non-opinion
uh, keeps you busy.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
They can find things to do and mess around,#Dispreferred answers
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and plot and scheme and everything else.#Other
Well, that's great.#Appreciation
You, did all five of yours complete college?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
our last daughter, she did not want to go to school.#Statement-non-opinion
She's, uh, but she's married now,#Statement-non-opinion
they built a home just a couple miles from us.#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Uninterpretable
Well, how did you go about selecting a college, then?#Wh-Question
Well, we did not do it right all the time#Dispreferred answers
With our first boy, we persuaded him to start here,#Statement-non-opinion
and I do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home.#Statement-opinion
I think the main thing is to, uh, right now, I think the main thing is to look at what they are interested in. Uh, and take what they are interested in,#Statement-opinion
and then, then start looking for schools.#Statement-opinion
Do you think that what they say that they are interested in is, at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
not necessarily.#Statement-non-opinion
ultimately graduating at.#Other
But, Mike, our oldest boy, I think he would have.#Statement-non-opinion
He wanted to go to Embrey Rey-, Riddle#Statement-non-opinion
and we talked him into going local here first.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh.#Statement-non-opinion
He went to aeronautical, uh, oh, just learning to work on engines and that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, it has to do with airplanes and everything, which is what his whole life is#Statement-non-opinion
And I really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And he would probably be flying, is what he would be doing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, but, but right now, of course, he's, he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut#Statement-non-opinion
and they build and rebuild non jet engines.#Statement-non-opinion
How about the other four, other three who went?#Open-Question
Uh, the other ones, uh, the second one, she chose, we let her go where she wanted to, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
we did not want her to go,#Statement-non-opinion
but she went to Erie, to Gannan University. Uh, or Gannan College,#Statement-non-opinion
I am not sure which it is,#Statement-non-opinion
college, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, she went there two years#Statement-non-opinion
and it was more expensive#Statement-non-opinion
and she soon realized, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
even though she did not like Clarion, she came back and finished at Clarion. Because, it, uh, saved her quite a bit of money#Statement-non-opinion
and she got really the same basic education that she wanted.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And our other two boys, they went to Clarion also. And, uh, did very well there.#Statement-non-opinion
And they have all really got, uh, they have all really got really good jobs.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
When they were, like in junior high and high school,#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, had they, did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and,#Other
Uh, yeah,#Yes answers
they kind of had that,#Statement-non-opinion
they just expected to go.#Statement-non-opinion
Daphne never went,#Statement-non-opinion
she always said she would never go to college.#Statement-non-opinion
She said, I, I always thought she would change her mind,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
but she did not.#Statement-non-opinion
And there's nothing wrong with that, you know, if,#Statement-opinion
college is not for everybody.#Statement-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, it, it does make a difference in your pa-, wage income.#Statement-opinion
I think it's what they want out of life,#Statement-opinion
because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are, they can make a, you know, a much better income.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like my kids, they are all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
You know, that boggles,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was,#Statement-non-opinion
my mind.#Other
I was making more than, I was making three times what my father was making,#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as an executive in the insurance industry, when he retired.#Other
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
did you go to college?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
You did.#Response Acknowledgement
See it makes a difference.#Statement-opinion
I went, uh, four years to undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because Lincoln is where, where my parents live.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And there really, there really was not a choice,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean the finances, uh, dictated that you had to go there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh. Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I kind of,#Uninterpretable
I am not going to say I resent it,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I was, well you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, one of the Rhodes Scholars kids,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the whole bit, uh,#Other
my parents did not even discuss with me going to college out of state,#Statement-non-opinion
Some place else.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or anyplace else,#Other
and I just knew that the finances, you know, would not support it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If I had known how, not, I am not going to say easy, but how much less difficult than I thought it would be to get a, uh, scholarship,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to go anyplace else, I think that I would definitely, you know, have gone#Other
Now when I finished there, then I got a scholarship to go the Harvard University in Boston.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that was, uh, I think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean I was,#Statement-non-opinion
That's great.#Appreciation
taken out of my element, you know, the homogeny midwest,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which is a lovely place to grow up,#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and put into someplace else where,#Other
.#Non-verbal
people thought differently,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
looked differently, sounded differently, you know,#Other
Different life styles,#Collaborative Completion
yes,#Uninterpretable
yes.#Uninterpretable
different life style.#Other
And I think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now my kids, I keep saying that, uh, you know, I would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I do not know, you know, what the realities, you know, is going to look like, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
we are putting money away already.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but I really think it's important to put these children someplace where, in addition to, you know, them getting an education, they really need a, you know, a socialization away from what they are raised in.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Especially if you lived a pretty insular community#Other
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
An upper class suburb of Dallas, let me tell you,#Other
It's quite a bit different.#Collaborative Completion
It's very different.#Other
See that's the way we are,#Statement-non-opinion
we are more of a rural type of an area#Statement-non-opinion
and it does make a difference.#Statement-non-opinion
I, they say, you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking.#Statement-non-opinion
You should not.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
not really.#Agree/Accept
Because, they say that a lot of times you get more help,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with a more expensive college.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so, in the long run, if it's really what they want, you know, they are better off.#Statement-opinion
Now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, we, we did all we could,#Statement-non-opinion
but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go.#Statement-non-opinion

Well, I, uh, before I was married, I used to play a lot of sports.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, but when I got married and had children and everything, it seems like I keep all my activity just chasing around fulfilling my obligations#Statement-non-opinion
so I haven't done a lot of, uh, exercise on purpose.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What about you?#Open-Question
Well, it's funny,#Hold before answer/agreement
this week,#Uninterpretable
yesterday I started exercising seriously.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
This weekend I cleaned out my closets#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, a couple years ago I, too, got married.#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't have any children yet,#Statement-non-opinion
but this weekend I cleaned out some closets#Statement-non-opinion
and I found a bathing suit that I had bought.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Tried it on and decided I really did not like how it looked on me.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh no,#No answers
that can be awful.#Statement-opinion
So yesterday I went to, uh, a spa.#Statement-non-opinion
I belong to a private spa and went in and, and got with a trainer#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, he checked body fat content#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we set up a program for me to work on,#Statement-non-opinion
and I went back tonight also.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's good.#Appreciation
So I've been two nights in a row#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I'm going to take it pretty seriously.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm going to start going every night just, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
even if I, I,#Uninterpretable
like tonight I only went for thirty minutes,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
but I at least did something.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you work out on,#Yes-No-Question
like, is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it?#Or-Clause
Last night I did about thirty minutes of riding a bike and a few, like, three different types of, uh, uh, weight lifting for my legs and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my hips#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then I did a hour of aerobics.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that was really tough#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I bet.#Appreciation
And I was sore this morning when I got up,#Statement-non-opinion
but then tonight I got into a, a,#Statement-non-opinion
it's sort of like an aerobics class#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it's only thirty minutes#Statement-non-opinion
and it's for your abdominals#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
your thighs, and your butt.#Other
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, and that was,#Uninterpretable
thirty minutes was definitely plenty.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So,#Uninterpretable
Doesn't sound like low impact.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
it was a lot of sweat#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Other
Well.#Uninterpretable
I've been trying to eat correctly also.#Other
Well that's good.#Appreciation
So,#Uninterpretable
So are you moti-,#Yes-No-Question
Have you started exercising at home#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Well, I, like, I am undisciplined in the sense that I can't just go and do exercise,#Statement-non-opinion
but I like to, uh, play tennis and play racquetball#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I like to get exercise when I'm playing a game of some sort,#Statement-non-opinion
and so that's always been the way that I have kept myself in, uh, the shape that I was satisfied with at least.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, then I have given that up,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I would really like to start that again, because I am now, you know, not in a position that I like myself.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't feel good#Statement-non-opinion
and I get, you know,#Uninterpretable
when you get out of shape and you don't,#Statement-opinion
if,#Uninterpretable
you're easily tired#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so that has made me,#Statement-non-opinion
but I, I'm not the kind of person that could go to a spa#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and work out,#Other
I just,#Uninterpretable
if something like, uh,#Uninterpretable
I mean I have so many chores and so many#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
obligations every day for, to add another obligation#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
would make me feel stressed.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I wouldn't enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
But if I have something, some team sport or some activity, then it's kind of like having fun,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
playing#Other
and then you, then you get some of the, uh, good exercise and some of the desired results,#Statement-opinion
but you, you're doing it for fun.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
But I really admire people who can go and work out#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Other
Well, I don't, you know,#Uninterpretable
a lot of people,#Uninterpretable
I have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
and she walks around, talks to people#Statement-non-opinion
and and, I don't really get into that.#Statement-non-opinion
Naturally I'm married#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so my husband goes a lot#Statement-non-opinion
and we'll go and, and just do what we want to do and then leave.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's nice.#Appreciation
But, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and swimming is a, is a part that I, I'd like to get into as far as my you know,#Statement-non-opinion
just aerobic activity#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they say that swimming is real good,#Other
so I'd like to try that as well.#Statement-non-opinion
And that's probably something that, that you could do, you know#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
family,#Other
It is kind,#Uninterpretable
included.#Other
It is family,#Collaborative Completion
and it's fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
It's a fun thing#Statement-non-opinion
and kids enjoy that and and all.#Statement-non-opinion
And also, the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation, you know, like saunas, or#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, uh, hot Jacuzzis or whatever,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they have that kind of is, kind of makes it fun and stuff, you know,#Other
you can relax that way,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
afterwards and things.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I agree#Agree/Accept
Well, I guess it's getting late.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I should take off,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I appreciate that,#Statement-non-opinion
that helped me, helped motivate me#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Think someone can do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Maybe I should start thinking about it again.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, try it#Action-directive
or, or maybe just exercise at home.#Action-directive
I bought a tape,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm going to try doing that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I bought one,#Statement-non-opinion
I went to the,#Uninterpretable
I bought the low impact first.#Statement-non-opinion
I thought,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I shouldn't out of the blue just jump in.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's me.#Statement-non-opinion
So, but I haven't done it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I'm going to try it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well you have a good night.#Conventional-closing

How much of a golfer are you?#Wh-Question
Are you a hacker?#Yes-No-Question
You bet.#Affirmative non-yes answers
.#Non-verbal
I'm fifty years old,#Statement-non-opinion
I've been a hacker,#Statement-non-opinion
I think, I think I played better golf when I was fifteen, John, than#Statement-non-opinion
I know I,#Statement-non-opinion
I play right now.#Other
Oh, I know I did,#Other
I know I did.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
Course, I know I watch my thirteen year old play now, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I know,#Agree/Accept
it's just unreal.#Statement-opinion
I, you know, I'm a guy that plays,#Statement-non-opinion
if I play a lot of golf, I play six to eight times a year#Statement-non-opinion
and that's about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I figure that's my retirement game.#Statement-non-opinion
I really,#Uninterpretable
I come from a family of golfers.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, I was raised by a man, my stepfather who, with a two handicap, I mean, he, he, he, he could get down on his knees and hit the ball, I mean, further than most people could hit it.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And my mother who is now, he's, my stepfather is dead, but my mother who is now seventy-one I can remember her being, I believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but, but, uh, all they did every day in their life was to play golf every,#Statement-non-opinion
they'd leave work and go to a golf course, or a little country club they belonged to back in Richmond, Virginia and just, uh, play nine holes of golf.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That was their deal,#Statement-non-opinion
they,#Uninterpretable
That's what it takes,#Appreciation
you, you need to play that often#Statement-opinion
But, uh#Statement-non-opinion
to get a really good handicap .#Other
I just, I just never could do it.#Other
I have a brother-in-law who is, uh, an ex-college coach and like a pro#Statement-non-opinion
and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf#Statement-non-opinion
sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I went to,#Statement-non-opinion
I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I went after it#Statement-non-opinion
and did, and I really didn't find much improvement.#Statement-non-opinion
Fact, ever time I'd start trying to correct something, it seemed like the score would *#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
go, go back up,#Other
yeah,#Yes answers
I, I#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
think I need to, uh,#Other
I probably need to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, and practice more often.#Other
Spend more time on the,#Statement-opinion
I think I'm probably the same way.#Statement-opinion
Lessons do help.#Statement-opinion
I know ever year we buy,#Statement-non-opinion
I go to this Ducks Unlimited dinner,#Statement-non-opinion
it's a hunter's type affair#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I buy in, in Austin, Texas,#Statement-non-opinion
I go down to Austin,#Statement-non-opinion
I live in the Dallas area, but I go down to Austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we always buy this weekend at a, at a country club in the hill country.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, at, uh, Horseshoe Bay.#Other
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
I'm familiar with it.#Statement-non-opinion
And we just have a ball,#Statement-non-opinion
and we play three days in a row, three different courses#Statement-non-opinion
and, course, believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the, uh, third course, my score has gone from, you know, a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
if you play regular, I think it makes a big difference.#Statement-non-opinion
You bet,#Agree/Accept
so it, that makes a lot of difference to me.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, well, I've also found, too, I, I try to work out regularly#Statement-non-opinion
and when I am doing that, uh, and feeling loose and, that I swing better,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I, I get through the ball better.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and I also, if I,#Uninterpretable
I found as I've gotten a little older here, I worry less about my distance.#Statement-non-opinion
You bet.#Agree/Accept
And I,#Uninterpretable
my control is a little bit better there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Uh, so,#Uninterpretable
That's super.#Appreciation
I haven't learned to hit the ball easy#Statement-non-opinion
and I just sort of,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I'm always wanting to hit it hard#Statement-non-opinion
and, that's something my stepfather never could teach me, you know, just to relax and hit the ball,#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, so, subsequently when I do tire out from playing like twelve, fourteen holes, my, you know, a lot of my energy's gone,#Statement-non-opinion
when I do swing it's an easier swing#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I do, actually, hit the ball better.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Have you ever, have you ever tried a one iron?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I have a two through, you know, two through wedge.#Statement-non-opinion
I hit a two iron awful lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Off, now, off the tee.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't hit a driver off the tee.#Statement-non-opinion
That, that's why I need my driving lessons.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you know, I put mine back in my bag this year, too,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I used a three wood rather than a driver.#Statement-non-opinion
That helps.#Appreciation
Uh, I had a lot more control on it, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I sacrificed distance,#Statement-non-opinion
but I wasn't in trouble every time I got down the fairway.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's, that's a good idea.#Statement-opinion
I think this next year, I'm going to, I'm going to attempt to play more#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm going to do the same thing.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I laid off my woods about three years ago#Statement-non-opinion
and I just use a two wood off the fairway#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm a fairly strong person#Statement-non-opinion
so I get a pretty good little drive#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I, and I guess control my irons, better, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
if you'll take lessons, the first thing they put in your hand is an iron.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
absolutely.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, I still remember that watching myself and my son#Statement-non-opinion
so, but I think the key is you just need to, you need to play more often than I play.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I, I read recently here, they say, if you're playing, if you're scoring well, you should play more.#Statement-opinion
If you're scoring poorly, you should spend more time on the practice g-,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, range.#Other
Uh, I think there is less flus-, frustration factor there, too, uh,#Statement-opinion
Makes good, makes good sense.#Appreciation
So, but I, I,#Uninterpretable
the one iron is something I've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that I, I should pick one up and try to start.#Statement-non-opinion
Apparently they're very difficult to play with,#Statement-opinion
but with practice, I would imagine you could groove that swing, too.#Statement-non-opinion
And I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron,#Statement-non-opinion
it's incredible.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, but, and his accuracy is what's so startling with it.#Statement-non-opinion
And I,#Uninterpretable
and it, but it's an iron that he's really practiced with.#Statement-non-opinion
He has used a lot,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it would be fun to get that good at a#Statement-opinion
You bet.#Appreciation
with an iron. Uh, distance iron.#Other
My cha-, my challenge of the game is just, if I can get off the first tee when everyone's standing around watching you, I'd be#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
great after that#Other
That, boy,#Uninterpretable
I just,#Uninterpretable
if I get off the tee box and I, and I've, you know, you know, anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight, I just want to get down and kiss the ground, you know#Statement-non-opinion
And get away without embarrassing yourself,#Summarize/reformulate
right#Agree/Accept
Because,#Uninterpretable

Uh, let's see.#Hold before answer/agreement
How about, uh, let's see, about ten years ago,#Uninterpretable
uh, what do you think was different ten years ago from now?#Open-Question
Well, I would say as, far as social changes go, uh, I think families were more together.#Statement-opinion
They, they did more things together.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, they ate dinner at the table together.#Statement-opinion
Uh, the parents usually took out time, uh, you know, more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, although I'm not a mother, I, I still think that, uh, a lot has changed since ten years ago.#Statement-opinion
Uh, what do you#Open-Question
We,#Uninterpretable
think about that?#Other
Well, uh, actually ten years from today seems rather short.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but I do agree that, uh, generally it's, society has sort of, uh, let's see, rushed everything ahead.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
it leaves, leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that.#Statement-opinion
In other words, they just prioritize their lives differently.#Statement-opinion
But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
What about like as far as, uh, social changes in the individual?#Open-Question
Do#Yes-No-Question
Uh,#Uninterpretable
you think that the individual has as much time as they did, let's say, ten, twenty years ago?#Other
Um. It depends.#Hedge
Uh, it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I just#Uninterpretable
Well, how, how old are you?#Wh-Question
I'm twenty-eight.#Statement-non-opinion
Twenty-eight.#Repeat-phrase
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
I'm twenty-three.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So there's maybe a five year gap between us.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh.#Uninterpretable
I just, I think that things were a bit, were, have been busy all along.#Statement-opinion
It's just#Statement-opinion
Huh#Uninterpretable
a matter where priorities are, at placed.#Other
Yes.#Agree/Accept
And that, uh, usually as far as families are concerned, there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And now, uh, it's pretty much an economic necessity of, for most, in most places for both parents to work.#Statement-opinion
Do you think it's an economic c-, necessity#Yes-No-Question
or do you think that we're, we're, uh, all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living?#Or-Clause
I think that's part of it too.#Statement-opinion
But I do think,#Statement-opinion
I mean do you think,#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
people really need two cars and#Other
No,#No answers
no.#No answers
I don't.#Statement-non-opinion
a house in the suburbs or,#Other
No,#No answers
I don't think that.#Statement-non-opinion
But then there are a lot of people that, that don't have that.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, that really do need to work.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think maybe those people that really do need to work, both parents, just to survive.#Statement-opinion
And#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then there, th-, is, is that other group that is#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
working to maintain a standard of living#Other
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
that, uh, they think is, is surviving which is really more luxuries.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but I I tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive.#Statement-opinion
Yo-, so you think it's,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
which group are you saying is the one trying?#Wh-Question
I'm saying that the, uh, the group that is just trying to survive from day to day, where both parents are working#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is more of the majority than the, than the people that have the higher standard of living.#Other
Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing, uh, middle class in this country#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that that's, in my opinion, the case.#Other
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
So.#Uninterpretable
I mean I have met people that, uh, both that, that just want to maintain a, the standard of living and those that, that really need the job.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then, sometimes I, I often, uh, find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. Yo-, a microwave, a V C R, a answering machine#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of those items, um, for the, for the, uh,#Other
well I guess we're sticking more to social changes#Statement-opinion
but, uh#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
people want all of that#Other
and not all of those are necessities.#Statement-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So they're trying to,#Statement-opinion
it has become a necessity#Statement-opinion

Well this is a subject that you never think you'll be assigned to#Statement-opinion
No#Agree/Accept
One that kind of comes up when you've lost it, the others, other subjects.#Other
Um, as I was sitting there, I thought, the weather's been perfect.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know much to say about it.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, uh, it's, you know,#Uninterpretable
for the balloon festival here in Plano it was just gorgeous.#Statement-opinion
I'm from Plano also.#Statement-non-opinion
Are you?#Backchannel in question form
It couldn't have been better.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
I mean, it didn't foul one launch,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's kind of unusual,#Statement-opinion
and it's kind of cold in the mornings#Statement-opinion
so you dress up warm,#Statement-opinion
but by,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's the only thing wrong I can find with it.#Statement-non-opinion
I just got back from Dayton.#Statement-non-opinion
I spent the weekend in Ohio with my family#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how fun.#Appreciation
and the trees are changing color there.#Statement-non-opinion
I miss that,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
So, that,#Uninterpretable
as soon as we got out of the cloud cover.#Statement-non-opinion
Of course it wasn't sunny like it is here.#Statement-non-opinion
It was real gray#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but as soon as the plane got through the clouds#Statement-non-opinion
and I saw all those trees,#Statement-non-opinion
it just really made me realize how much I miss the fall.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't complain weather wise though, because it was also thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and the high was only fifty,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon#Statement-non-opinion
Ooh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess you have to take some things and leave some things.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm from Utah area,#Statement-non-opinion
and they, you know, they have tons of canyons where the leaves change#Statement-non-opinion
and they're gorgeous#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area.#Statement-non-opinion
We did that when we lived up in Michigan.#Statement-non-opinion
We went up to the upper peninsula,#Statement-non-opinion
and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And then on leaf weekends it was, which is this time of the year, it's bumper to bumper traffic,#Statement-non-opinion
people as#Uninterpretable
whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves, because they had to keep watching the road.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's kind of hazardous for driving#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
that's for sure.#Appreciation
But I can't complain.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if I've been spoiled.#Statement-non-opinion
I've been thinking it's getting cold sooner than normal.#Statement-opinion
We've only lived here a couple of years.#Statement-non-opinion
I think it is,#Agree/Accept
and my family said that in Ohio there was just an article on, at the T V news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as far as the coldness of the temperatures and, uh, the first frost,#Other
everything just happened three weeks early this year.#Statement-non-opinion
We'll have to see how it goes,#Statement-opinion
a couple of weeks ago we were cooler than normal,#Statement-opinion
but then we're back to being warmer than normal this week, or last week,#Statement-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Just so we don't have one of those famous ice storms#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
in the spring.#Other
I don't have to live through many, any of those really,#Statement-non-opinion
a bad,#Uninterpretable
I mean, nothing comparable, I guess, to what you've had before.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, I've only been here just a short time, too,#Dispreferred answers
so I haven't been through#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
any of those either,#Other
so. I have in Michigan,#Statement-non-opinion
but in Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow#Statement-non-opinion
and life goes on.#Statement-non-opinion
You're right.#Agree/Accept
So, as I understand it here, if there's anything, they'll call off schools and, and close businesses.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they get ice,#Statement-non-opinion
and no one can drive on ice.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, we used to think they were pansies,#Statement-non-opinion
but then when you decided what ice was#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
the real definition of ice#Agree/Accept
So, well, I think we've discussed it good enough today.#Conventional-closing
I think so.#Conventional-closing
It was,#Conventional-closing
It was nice talking with you.#Conventional-closing
It was good talking to you.#Other
Maybe we'll get the next time.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing

And, you know, just so that they get to know their grandparents, but also for help#Statement-non-opinion

We don't, we don't have that luxury.#Statement-non-opinion
But, we have lots of friends,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and everybody tends to be in the same boat.#Statement-non-opinion
So we, we trade off a whole lot with friends and, you know, run here and run there.#Statement-non-opinion
We're right smack dab in the middle of baseball season right now.#Statement-non-opinion
And we have three playing baseball.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's marvelous.#Appreciation
So#Uninterpretable
Well they keep you hopping, I'm sure.#Statement-opinion
They definitely do.#Agree/Accept
Well, I know, uh, that, uh, one of the ladies I know, they are very involved with their little girl#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for, uh, her musical, uh, talents#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
her sports abilities#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

but that hasn't been, uh, possible.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, she's tried many, uh, avenues#Statement-non-opinion

so we, we tend to do a lot of running.#Statement-non-opinion
Things are very different nowadays than when I grew up#Statement-opinion
Oh, they are.#Agree/Accept
and I'm sure when your children grew up you didn't, you know,#Statement-opinion
I don't remember doing all these things.#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
I certainly don't remember my parents running me here and there and supporting me in all these things,#Statement-non-opinion
but we had more, I guess family time alone#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you're,#Uninterpretable
where we did nothing.#Other
Now I think#Statement-opinion
Which was good.#Other
every-, everything is doing, doing, doing, out of the house.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept

Which can be very hectic.#Other
It can be#Agree/Accept
and, and sometimes I, you know, I kind of long for the good old days when#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it wasn't so he-,#Summarize/reformulate
we didn't do all these running.#Other
But on the other hand, we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other parents#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we've had a lot of fun with that, too.#Other
You have to look on that, on the, uh, positive side of that.#Statement-opinion
It's just different.#Statement-opinion

it is.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's just a different lifestyle.#Summarize/reformulate

I think, uh, uh, those type of children, uh, that are involved in things like that, their, uh, goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things.#Statement-opinion
Well, I think so,#Agree/Accept
and, and I think they've learned a whole lot about being part of a team, whether the team is your singing group, your band, your#Statement-opinion

involved in all those things.#Other
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
That's wonderful.#Other
That's really is#Statement-opinion

nice to have in your background, that, you know, then you can, you're, you can be very flexible.#Other

And, uh, there's less, uh, friction involved in relationships when you add that skill#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of teamwork.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I mean a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes.#Agree/Accept
And I think it's a step, a, a giant step of progress, I really do.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
So, uh, I,#Uninterpretable
Give me some wonderful advice Catherine.#Action-directive
What is the best advice of mothering that you know?#Wh-Question

Well, uh, Cathy, I think if you look to the Word of God#Other

and, uh, think on the things that are pure and lovely#Other
and, uh, keep your mind off of negative things.#Action-directive

And keep your mind on positive things#Action-directive

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, even if they're, even if they're discouraged, tell them that that's just a passing moment#Action-directive
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and to dwell on those things that are, uh, not negative and that are positive things in their life#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, I think you'll see a lot of growth in, uh, in their ability to, uh, control their thought pattern#Statement-opinion
and, and when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God.#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
Well, I would agree with that.#Agree/Accept
We're also real active in our church#Statement-non-opinion

I can go ahead and start,#Affirmative non-yes answers
Sure, go ahead.#Action-directive
uh, in Dallas there's definitely a crime problem,#Statement-opinion
I know it's, you know, worse in the larger cities.#Statement-opinion
Um, it's kind of a concern for me,#Statement-non-opinion
in fact, at the moment I'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it's,#Uninterpretable
I am single and female,#Statement-non-opinion
you definitely are going to worry about the location, and, uh, you know, accessibility of people to be able to break in.#Statement-opinion
I live on a third floor now,#Statement-non-opinion
but, I, you know, I'm real concerned that I, I don't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
and, the, um,#Uninterpretable
Do they have many buildings that have security there?#Yes-No-Question
Some buildings do,#Affirmative non-yes answers
it depends on the location.#Statement-non-opinion
The area I live in right now, is, is real good as far as crime rate is concerned#Statement-non-opinion
and we don't have anything at all, no burglar alarms, no guards.#Statement-non-opinion
Some, some places do have guard gates that you have to get through, or electronic access gates and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well I, I went to Dallas, uh, when I worked for T I in Abilene#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
I'm a little familiar with the city area, Forest Lane and, you know, through that, off, off the freeway.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, it didn't seem like it was that congested in that, that part.#Statement-non-opinion
You know because to me where we live out here in the north east, it, it's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the cities are very populated with tenement housing,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where there are more than one family in a house.#Other
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And with the, uh, people that are coming into the country from other countries, not knowing the language#Other
and, uh, they-, they're going to the big cities.#Statement-opinion
It makes it very difficult.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It really does,#Statement-opinion
and, and I've seen the same thing that you're talking about, uh, much more crime than ever before.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Drugs of course, uh, a big part of it I think.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
a lot of younger people, you know, into more violent crimes.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Tha-, that, that's really sad, you know,#Appreciation
you got young boys or girls, that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and, no remorse, what so ever.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
There's a lot of that going on in Dallas, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
it's really sad.#Statement-opinion
It is#Agree/Accept
and, and I don't know if it's, uh, the family, you know, thing where they're not bonding anymore, where mothers are working all the time and,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the kids aren't getting the attention that they need, or the television.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I, I really think that we're, we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I agree.#Agree/Accept
I think that people are getting off too easy.#Statement-opinion
They're getting, they're getting paroled too easily.#Statement-opinion
Uh, uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They're just getting, uh, put on probation or something, because the prisons don't have enough room#Statement-opinion
so they get, they get lighter sentences,#Statement-opinion
Yeah, exactly.#Agree/Accept
and some of those people, they don't deserve to be let loose.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, you know, they had, uh,#Uninterpretable
in fact on the news last night we were watching this, uh, man who lost his ten year old daughter.#Statement-non-opinion
He ran out to the store for a few minutes#Statement-non-opinion
and he had left her home alone.#Statement-non-opinion
Sh-, now ten years old,#Statement-non-opinion
she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And while he was gone, he had looked, went looking for a job and stopped at the store,#Statement-non-opinion
that's what it was.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets, these two men, went in, raped the girl, murdered her,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh my gosh.#Appreciation
and the whole bit.#Other
And one of the men got, uh, I think it was seventeen years#Statement-non-opinion
and the other one was in for, uh, life imprisonment.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The one that was in for the seventeen years, actually served seven,#Statement-non-opinion
and he's out.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, that's terrible.#Appreciation
And the man said, that, you know, if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail, that he would eliminate this person himself.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then go to McDonalds and have a hamburger and not thing a thing, think a thing about it.#Other
.#Non-verbal
And I mean, I think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that innocent people,#Other
I, I shouldn't say innocent, because I mean, ac-, actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it, you know, it's like two different things.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sometimes when you lose someone that you really love, you do some crazy things#Statement-opinion
yo-,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
Right,#Agree/Accept
it's a little more understandable under the circumstances, I guess.#Statement-opinion
I, I like the idea that, uh, if someone is from a foreign country,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they come to this country and uh, commit, a crime, I think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything, they should be immediately deported.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Especially if they're found guilty of the crime.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, once they, they have been arrested#Statement-opinion
and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt, these people are guilty.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's it,#Statement-opinion
we don't take care of them,#Statement-opinion
we don't support them,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
nothing,#Other
I mean they go right back where they came from.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
we have enough, enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is.#Statement-opinion
So let, let their country take care of it.#Statement-opinion
Exactly#Agree/Accept
and,#Uninterpretable
We don't have, I guess too much trouble in Dallas with,#Statement-non-opinion
well, I guess, I guess we do have a lot of people come in from Mexico, that cause problems,#Statement-opinion
but, uh.#Uninterpretable
But that's, uh, the-, they're, so close,#Statement-opinion
I, I don't consider Mexican people in the same category with, uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
especially like, uh, people who come from cultures that don't have the same, uh, kind of moral upbringing that we have.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like you take Asian countries, or, uh, the Eastern countries where women are like in the foreground,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, in the background and the men are in the foreground,#Other
and it's like, you know,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, they live back in whe-, where we came from two hundred years ago.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, whe-, we've advanced beyond that,#Statement-opinion
and I think that their, uh, mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing,#Statement-opinion
you know what I mean.#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
It was amazing#Statement-non-opinion
I went to the Far East, uh, back in October to do some training for T I#Statement-non-opinion
and I,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, some of those countries were so safe, it was unreal.#Statement-non-opinion
Singapore is very, supposed to be very safe#Statement-non-opinion
and, in fact, Tokyo,#Statement-non-opinion
and I thought Tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they,#Uninterpretable
at, at the T I there, I said is there any area I should avoid.#Statement-non-opinion
And the guy said let me ask another girl here#Statement-non-opinion
and he turned and asked this girl, and said, can you think of any place where Dana shouldn't go by herself, or anything.#Statement-non-opinion
And she, she thought for a few minutes#Statement-non-opinion
and she said, no.#Statement-non-opinion
And he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself.#Statement-non-opinion
She said, no.#Statement-non-opinion
And they said,#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway#Other
and somebody will turn it in#Quotation
and, and nothing will be missing.#Quotation
They said they can just about guarantee that there, that, that would happen if you did that.#Statement-non-opinion
I thought, boy, in America,#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
if you left a purse on a subway, you would never see it again.#Other
You better believe it,#Appreciation
if,#Uninterpretable
you wouldn't even have to leave it,#Statement-opinion
I mean,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true,#Agree/Accept
it would get snatched right off your arm#Statement-opinion
that's true.#Agree/Accept
But I was thinking boy, in Dallas, if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night, I'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh sure.#Agree/Accept
I mean, I couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place.#Statement-non-opinion
They said, the, apparently the crime, is, just, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
That's amazing,#Appreciation
well, wh-, what's the difference there,#Wh-Question
do you know?#Yes-No-Question
I'm not sure what it is there.#Other answers
Now, I know what it is in Singapore, is they have the death penalty#Statement-non-opinion
and they really enforce it,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I, I believe in the death penalty,#Statement-non-opinion
I really do.#Statement-non-opinion
like for drugs, for drugs they, they enforce the death penalty for that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, they're just, very, very tough,#Statement-non-opinion
and I guess maybe that's the way Tokyo is too, or Japan is too.#Statement-non-opinion
They're just very tough on criminals.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that we're too easy.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and we take the, the, uh, civil liberties, uh, stuff too far.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know like people that are in prison, I mean we didn't put them there.#Statement-opinion
They put themselves in that situation.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
oh yeah.#Agree/Accept
And as far as like them, uh, entertaining the rights that they should have.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, we educate them,#Statement-opinion
we feed them,#Statement-opinion
we take care of them#Statement-opinion
and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm not saying they're all bad,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that they should be put away.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
and if they're overcrowded, well, you know#Statement-opinion
Get rid of them.#Collaborative Completion
they shouldn't have gotten theirself there in the first place.#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
I, I really, I, I think that that's the whole key here.#Statement-opinion
This plea bargaining baloney,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where, uh, you know, they plead to a lesser crime, or, uh, they plead guilty in, or, you know, tell about someone else and they, they get less time,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or, if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior, for every year they're in they get so many less, you know, that they don't serve the full penalty.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, I really think we're going to far overboard with all of this.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree, because it's not fair to those of us that, that deserve a safe, you know, life to have to,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
same with drunk drivers.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it's too easy for them.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That if the, the laws, and, and were, were harsher and were enforced,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean you have to set an example.#Statement-opinion
You have to start somewhere.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist, they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
An, it, an I feel bad for the policeman,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because he's out there every day facing these people.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
This, this craziness, you know, people with, uh, automatic weapons and, uh, all this other stuff and trying to do a job#Other
and let's face it,#Action-directive
what do they get paid.#Rhetorical-Questions
Right,#Agree/Accept
not much.#Statement-opinion
Twenty thousand dollars a year, if they're lucky.#Statement-opinion
I wouldn't do it for that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
huh-uh,#Agree/Accept
and especially not in some of these big cities,#Statement-opinion
like in Dallas I mean they've had,#Statement-non-opinion
they're up in the top, top five I think of cities that are getting policeman killed on, on, in the line of duty#Statement-non-opinion
and that's really sad.#Appreciation
It is, it really is.#Agree/Accept
And I mean, they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and I'm not saying that they're all good either, because there's good and bad in everything,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they, they're already, uh, have str-, three strikes against them when they're out there.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because they'll arrest someone and, you know, go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this, and having all kinds of evidence#Statement-opinion
and you have to even be careful how you arrest them, how you talk to them, uh, you know, what they say,#Statement-opinion

Okay,#Other
well what do you think?#Open-Question
Well, I'm kind of leaning towards, I don't know, I'm thinking about what, from one to ten what my no would be.#Statement-non-opinion
It would probably be somewhere closer to, uh, less control because I don't see,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not a member of the N R A although my,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
father is.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I guess I believe, I think the N R A has gone overboard the wrong way. You know,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're sitting there on number ten,#Statement-opinion
they're saying absolutely no gun control,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
we don't even want to think about it#Other
and, and I think that's a dumb,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
situation.#Other
Because there has got to be some kind of background check to see,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose, you know, if, if you're going to hunt with it,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or if you're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
That's true.#Agree/Accept
It's not a big deal for them to go.#Statement-opinion
If they're can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket, you know, I mean, they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of psychiatric record,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
armed, you know, felony record.#Other
That's true.#Agree/Accept
any of that kind of stuff.#Statement-opinion
And, it seems to me right now that there's not, there's not that much of a check.#Statement-opinion
I, I'm not really sure what Texas law, I think there's a check for felonies, on your record.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
But,#Uninterpretable
If the gun shop owner does it,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but he has to go out and do it.#Statement-opinion
That's true, I think,#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if, and if it's a private sale, of course, then there's nothing.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
And, see that's my only problem with, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
making you, um,#Uninterpretable
you know, get the check and everything is, is, I guess bad guys, if you want to call them bad guys,#Statement-opinion
they are going to get a gun no matter what.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They're not,#Uninterpretable
I don't think they're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check,#Statement-opinion
I think they're going to go out and find it someway, individual sale or something like that.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
But, but maybe we'll prevent a few John Hinckleys.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I hope.#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
You know, I, I,#Uninterpretable
that, that's the kind of people,#Statement-opinion
like I say, I don't think the guy who's going to rob a Seven Eleven, is going to rob a Seven Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife, baseball bat,#Statement-opinion
Knife,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
exactly.#Agree/Accept
or, you know, whatever,#Other
He's going to do what he wants to do.#Statement-opinion
but, you know,#Uninterpretable
That's true.#Agree/Accept
I, I just think it makes honest people more honest#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Other
And, and the people who want it, it's not that big a deal, like I say, to wait.#Statement-opinion
Right .#Agree/Accept
Right.#Agree/Accept
And, if you have to have it in a hurry, something's wrong#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it makes you wonder,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
what they need it for all of a sudden here. Um,#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I'm married to a policeman,#Statement-non-opinion
so we, we talk about this a lot#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I imagine his, his opinion is a little bit towards the one there,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on the#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
scale of one to ten he needs some more.#Other
Yeah.#Yes answers
I was watching a,#Statement-non-opinion
Gosh,#Appreciation
if I was a cop I would be,#Statement-non-opinion
worried about that.#Collaborative Completion
Too many people have too many, too much access.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they do.#Agree/Accept
They do.#Agree/Accept
and, I guess I think, the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is, there should be some law against the types of gu-,#Statement-opinion
I mean,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
some of these Saturday night specials that these companies put out,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that are , pie-, I mean, they're are#Other
basically it says here buy me and go rob a seven eleven#Statement-opinion
right#Agree/Accept
or even even the um the little um toy guns look real.#Statement-opinion
I mean#Uninterpretable
yes#Agree/Accept
they that's really gotten bad#Statement-opinion
I've heard so much about that on TV#Statement-non-opinion
and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one.#Statement-opinion
Or your child#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
accidently.#Other
If your child is old enough,#Statement-opinion
I mean, there are a lot of kids who when they're ten look like they're twelve,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or fourteen or, and, and, especially some of the minority children. Whether,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know a racist or not,#Other
that's the truth.#Statement-opinion
And, And if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands#Statement-opinion
and a cop comes up,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
I mean, you can't blame them.#Statement-opinion
It looks#Statement-opinion
You can't ,#Statement-opinion
like they've got a weapon.#Other
Jeez and you can't take the chances.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
Because there's been kids that age who have killed people.#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
And, you know, you know, there was a law in, I think it's in Oregon, where they've now made all toy guns,#Statement-non-opinion
they're making them neon colors.#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I think, that's a good idea.#Statement-opinion
You know like, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the kids don't care.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
My kid didn't care.#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
He picks up a stick and goes bang.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It doesn't make any difference to him.#Statement-non-opinion
A gun is a gun to them.#Statement-opinion
Yeah .#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They can play with anything and make it a gun.#Statement-opinion
That's exactly right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
so you like to do,#Uninterpretable
I think they ought to do that with toy guns,#Statement-opinion
they ought to make them very reasonably#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
do something outrageous to them.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
You know, so that they're not very distinguishable from a real gun.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
That's a good idea.#Appreciation
I was, uh, watching T V yesterday#Statement-non-opinion
and there is a town in Georgia,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's the law that you have a gun,#Statement-non-opinion
every adult, you know, uh, is able to carry a gun,#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
That's kind of ,#Statement-opinion
and they encourage it.#Other
They encourage it?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
And, the police love it.#Statement-non-opinion
Which really surprised me#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and, I think, and that's what they were going after, uh, they went to interview this town,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it's a little dinky town,#Statement-non-opinion
they went to interview them about the gun control laws#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, the police said, all the people said, that's fine we could care less.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, we're all honest, and everything like,#Quotation
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that,#Other
we, we all carry them,#Quotation
but we, we don't mind being checked.#Quotation
And, uh, and I think it kind of took that uh, neatness away from it, you know,#Statement-opinion
like, well heck, everybody's got one, you know#Statement-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
I,#Uninterpretable
So, it was, it was quite unusual to see the people in that town.#Other
That's kind of an odd thing.#Appreciation
I don't know,#Hedge
I have a gun#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, my folks have always had.#Statement-non-opinion
I learned to shoot when I was real little.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's a lot of it too, is that people need to teach their kids,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what not to, what to do and what not to do.#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Because I started shooting, my Dad started letting me shoot like a little air B B gun,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when I was probably five or six years old.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, you know, it was,#Uninterpretable
this is how you hold#Quotation
it, this is the only place that you do it, which, was,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know out far and away#Other
and you don't ever touch it unless I'm here,#Quotation
and you don't#Quotation
That's what we're doing.#Statement-non-opinion
you don't point it at people,#Other
and then they had,#Uninterpretable
then they went to the Texas Parks and Recreation, I guess,#Statement-non-opinion
but anyway the s-, hunter safety program,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you have to do now.#Other
I think it started in about nineteen seventy.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If you want, if you want to go deer hunting#Statement-non-opinion
and your birthday's after nineteen something,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
fifty-five or something, then you have to attend one of these hunter safety courses#Other
Well, that's neat.#Appreciation
or you can't get a deer license.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's real neat.#Appreciation
And it, and it, it's basic stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
it's like, it's don't, you know, when you're climbing over a barbed wire fence, don't point, lean your gun against it, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then you crawl over it,#Quotation
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and shoot yourself.#Other
And, uh,#Statement-opinion
Well, that's real good.#Appreciation
those things happen.#Other
It, it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Right.#Agree/Accept
And they usually are real basic,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
put the safety on the gun.#Statement-non-opinion
common sense things.#Other
Don't assume, always assume it's loaded.#Statement-non-opinion
That's, that's got to be the most common thing that people,#Statement-opinion
I know#Agree/Accept

Yeah.#Agree/Accept
It's, oh, it's empty,#Quotation
it's empty.#Quotation
Boom!#Quotation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well see I,#Uninterpretable
I took the clip out, or whatever#Statement-non-opinion

In the chamber That's exactly right.#Repeat-phrase
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well we, we're trying to teach our daughter.#Statement-non-opinion
She knows real well about, uh, about her Daddy's guns,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what not to do and what to do around them.#Other
Does he got them locked up all the time too?#Rhetorical-Questions
When he's ,#Uninterpretable
Yeah, um,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and she, and she's real,#Statement-non-opinion
um, she'll know,#Uninterpretable
she'll even tell her friends, don't ever,#Statement-non-opinion
Don't even think about it,#Collaborative Completion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
touch my Daddy's guns or something like that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, she's real, she's real good about it.#Statement-non-opinion
And, she's never been curious,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, cause he's always, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
if he has them out, cleaning them, you know, she can be there#Statement-non-opinion
and he'll tell how he's doing it or, you know, show her the insides or stuff like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you make it where it's not something,#Statement-opinion
to be feared#Collaborative Completion
Curious,#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared about.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
If it, if it's just one more piece of something,#Statement-opinion
but they, but they've got to understand, like you said, never touch it.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
they'd have that respect for what it does,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and what it can do.#Other
Ours is a,#Uninterpretable
we have a shotgun,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's up in the closet,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then the shells are in another part#Statement-non-opinion
and it's something to think about,#Statement-opinion
and I got it because my husband used to travel, and be out,#Statement-non-opinion
he was out of the country at one time for three months.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, I was like, I live in a nice neighborhood,#Statement-non-opinion
but still,#Uninterpretable
still#Repeat-phrase
and then I've got it so far,#Statement-non-opinion
sometimes I think, I wonder if I, I'm not about to load it because I, you know, I assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's in a case,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, you know, it's put up#Statement-non-opinion
and it's away and all that,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, I don't want to take the chance#Statement-non-opinion
and, I think, if somebody ever does break in,#Statement-non-opinion
He's got to go to a lot of trouble.#Collaborative Completion
it's going to take me a year to find the shells,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then get it,#Other
hold on,#Quotation

Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He's in here somewhere,#Quotation
I know he is.#Quotation
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I know how to use one.#Statement-non-opinion
We, we go hunting every once in a while#Statement-non-opinion
and he showed me how to use his guns#Statement-non-opinion
and I really enjoy it#Statement-non-opinion
but, boy if someone did break in, I don't, I don't know that I could or would even grab it#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Agree/Accept
I, I used to think about that,#Statement-non-opinion
it was a lot easier when I was, when I was single,#Statement-non-opinion
it was one thing#Statement-non-opinion
and when I was just married with no kids,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
That's true.#Agree/Accept
when it was just me, it was an easy decision.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was like, you, you come after me, you're going to get it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
and now there's so many other things, where are the kids, what are they doing,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, where is this person coming in from,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, you've got,#Uninterpretable
and, and, if, if you manage to get it out#Uninterpretable
and then, you know, what, how can you even afford to, to think about what, what you're going to do because you don't know where your kids are,#Statement-opinion
True.#Appreciation
at the same time.#Other
True,#Appreciation
well we, we have dogs#Statement-non-opinion
Ugh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that are pretty, you know, very protective, you know#Other
We feel if they make enough noise that,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
if they're stupid enough to come through then#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
It, it,#Uninterpretable
we have two big dogs in the backyard,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and always kind of thought that too, kind of an extra buffer.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
They've got to be pretty stupid,#Statement-opinion
and, and most people that, uh, break in or whatever, go to houses without the dogs,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
luckily.#Other
Anything, that the,#Uninterpretable
well any, any advantage that they can take.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, that's one of them#Statement-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Unfortunately,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well,#Uninterpretable
Guess it makes it worth the dog food over the years#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Really does.#Agree/Accept
Well, do you think we've,#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
I, I think that's about all I can,#Conventional-closing
Me too, on gun control.#Conventional-closing
We, we're in pretty good agreement actually on it.#Conventional-closing
Yeah.#Conventional-closing
I think we are.#Conventional-closing
It would be an interesting, it would be even more interesting you, you to be some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum.#Conventional-closing
Right.#Conventional-closing
Right.#Conventional-closing
I'm glad you're not#Conventional-closing
Me too.#Conventional-closing
I'm glad to find there's another reasonable person in Garland.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Well good!#Conventional-closing
Well, it's been nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
You too,#Conventional-closing
thanks.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay,#Other
you want to tell me first how you feel about#Action-directive
Well#Statement-opinion
the proposal,#Other
um, I, I just think the way that things are going that, um, it would be good for young people to go ahead and have, um, dedicate themselves to at least something.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know, like the Mormon religion, you know, they require two years of service, uh, missionary service#Statement-opinion
The boys#Statement-non-opinion
right,#Agree/Accept
the boys#Statement-non-opinion
not the girls, the boys.#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, so, but I think it would be good for all young people#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, to be able to, to do something like that#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, so that, um, you know, I don't know, I just feel it would be good for them to do that.#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
I, I thought it would be good, too,#Statement-opinion
but I did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because not all young people would have, uh, what it takes to go like that#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I think it takes a certain person to, to be able to do something like that,#Other
but there's a lot of other public service things#Statement-opinion
Oh, sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that could be done.#Other
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and even, even in our home towns there's a lot of#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, public service things that they could do#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, you know, drug rehabilitation and#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and alcohol and, and just, uh, helping old people, and, um, uh, you know, helping cripple, just helping somebody else#Other
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I think that art of giving is something that, um, we don't have very much any more.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it would be that.#Statement-opinion
When they say this proposal, is this something that they're just suggesting,#Yes-No-Question
or are they actually,#Or-Clause
why, why, why did they call it a proposal,#Wh-Question
that,#Uninterpretable
Oh, I think they just gave it a title#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but is this not something that's, um, in legislation or#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in work some#Other
That's what I wondered.#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
no, no,#No answers
it's not,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just a, just a topic,#Statement-non-opinion
It'd be good character builder.#Statement-opinion
I think so, too.#Agree/Accept
I think so, too.#Agree/Accept
Um, because there's so many, um, kids who have, uh, you know, so much money and so much free time and, uh, nothing to do, um, and nothing to give their time to.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, they don't even have a direction to give their, their time to,#Statement-opinion
so I think#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it would be really good for people to, um, to be able to give their time in, in, uh, some kind of public service, uh, even in our government, you know, as, uh, aids to, uh, you know, Congress, uh, people#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, um, yeah,#Uninterpretable
it would be, it'd be really good#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think.#Other
Well, people that are, um, have received sentences in jail, they have, uh, some of them are going out and doing, uh, they have to go out and do public service#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
activities#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which to me is, is good.#Other
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
oh yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree with you.#Statement-opinion
This is something that, um, like you say, is it's character building#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, you know, learning how to, to give to others, and being less selfish#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Well, I think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like, you know, what#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what some of the other parts of the world are like or#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even other parts of the neighborhood#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
some of the people, how they live#Other
or,#Uninterpretable
Oh, I agree with you,#Agree/Accept
I agree with you,#Agree/Accept
and I think, uh, young people are so, um, uh, focused just on themselves and their activities, and whose going out with whom, et cetera#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, uh, you know, to get a taste of what the real world is actually about#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
doing that public service would be great.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because that's one thing that's hard, with young people, you, you can't tell them how things are#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they have to see for themselves#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years,#Statement-opinion
I don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I would think so, like right after, um, high school#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, even if it was the, the, their, um, that summer right after high school#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, three months,#Other
Of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, they, their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and something,#Other
course now Peace Corps, that couldn't be done of course, until they were done with school#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, - *#Other
You know, something that out, that was outside of, uh, outside of school#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Other
but, yeah,#Other
you know, right, right after you graduate from, um, high school, because a lot of people are just, um, uh, Well gee whiz, what do I do now#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if they're not focused on going to college,#Other
and, uh, you know, having that, that, uh, gung ho plan#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, that's, you know, setting their life goals.#Other
Kind of an in-between#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
time.#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so to me, see that would be the, the, uh, the greatest time for, um, you know, teenagers to, to do that, would be right after they graduated from high school.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But as for its being required#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, we're just not, we're not based on, on that, uh#Other
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
type of a system. Um.#Other
No,#Agree/Accept
and like I said, not, now all young people should be able to do something,#Statement-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
not all certainly would be geared to, even the, the Mormon boys that go out, not all of them go,#Other
I mean#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's disaster if they don't go,#Other
but#Statement-opinion
Oh, right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but some of them are not,#Other
they're just not made to do that type of thing#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they just aren't able to do it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, um, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it'd be good#Statement-opinion
but like I said, requiring it would be, uh,#Statement-opinion

Well, I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the U S budget.#Statement-opinion
Well, now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's only getting worse exponentially#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it seems.#Other
Exactly.#Appreciation
Um,#Uninterpretable
There's, uh, maybe some short-term things that they can do#Statement-opinion
and it hurts everybody's pocket, of course,#Statement-opinion
but, um, I know that state has, uh, cutback, uh, raises for a year to help, uh, the, uh, state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in a better condition.#Other
That,#Uninterpretable
Oh, which state is that?#Wh-Question
Uh, State of Minnesota.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So there's the potential that perhaps, you know, the U S budget might want to take a look at it's, uh, federal employees or, and take a look at saying, well, let's freeze wages.#Statement-opinion
I mean everybody's doing it so it isn't#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like, uh, private business has had to do it#Other
so#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a shir-, that's got to be very short term.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the only other avenue that I can think of is, uh, looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying, well, we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money.#Statement-opinion
As#Statement-non-opinion
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for, for instance, I think you probably remember the military getting caught, um, with toilet seats that cost them four hundred, five hundred dollars.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was just,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
I mean you can go to K-Mart and buy them for, uh, eight dollars or I think#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
six dollars or whatever for toilet seats,#Other
so.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Definitely#Appreciation
So it gives you a-,#Other
I think that there's#Statement-opinion
idea that,#Other
probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place.#Other
Sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
I mean there was, um, people at Stanford who were soaking the government, you know, using millions of dollars of research money#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to, uh, for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think that, that maybe more widespread#Statement-opinion
Than we think.#Collaborative Completion
than#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, than we'd like to have think.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, but then it's something that's hard to enforce too I'm sure.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It sure is.#Agree/Accept
The, you know, as far as,#Uninterpretable
I think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days#Statement-opinion
and actually, uh, the conferences were nothing#Statement-opinion
but, uh, you know, they're getting paid for this,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was something more than just the conferences.#Statement-non-opinion
They were using it as eating out, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
when you think about people, uh, taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's a real big crunch, uh#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of course, when they get caught then they're, you know, they're guilty of course,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, during that time I'm sure there's hundreds of, uh, thousands of people that are, uh, spending money that does not belong to them.#Statement-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's right.#Appreciation
Uh, I think that, oh, politicians talk a lot about waste#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean when you look at something like the Gulf War#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it cost us God knows how much. You know, at a million dollars,#Other
.#Non-verbal
a pop for patriot missiles.#Other
Exactly.#Appreciation
And I don't think, uh, it's ended up being,#Statement-opinion
I mean it gave people jobs#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I think it also cost, um, quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war, a lot of things were no longer put to use.#Statement-opinion
I mean it was kind of like, okay, we'll do this during this point and time#Statement-opinion
but after that that's, you know, uh#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they didn't want to do it anymore.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things.#Statement-non-opinion
So#Hedge
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay,#Conventional-closing
well, it was good talking to you#Conventional-closing
and#Conventional-closing
Okay#Conventional-closing
have a good evening.#Other
All right.#Conventional-closing
You too.#Conventional-closing
Uh-huh,#Conventional-closing
thanks.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye now.#Conventional-closing

The AIDS issue is, is a bit of a problem.#Statement-opinion
I guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem, is, is the financial end.#Statement-non-opinion
And how can a country stand to, uh, spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem, uh,#Rhetorical-Questions
but, then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the, the knowledge, or at least the, the rumor, I'm not really sure if it's true or not, that, uh, we're not spending as much per, let's say, afflicted person on cancer.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, there's some, uh,#Uninterpretable
take breast cancer, for instance.#Statement-non-opinion
It seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more pe-, many more people than AIDS.#Statement-non-opinion
And yet, uh, more people die of it,#Statement-non-opinion
and yet the funding has already, uh, exceeded,#Statement-non-opinion
AIDS has more money than, uh, breast cancer#Statement-non-opinion
Than,#Uninterpretable
well, that's interesting, isn't it,#Yes-No-Question
yeah.#Uninterpretable
So, uh,#Uninterpretable
I mean, if it's true.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I've, I've always heard these things.#Statement-non-opinion
I've never bothered to dig it out and make sure,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I've heard it on more than one documentary that, uh, they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just one big P R campaign that,#Statement-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
we think that's the world's worst thing#Quotation
so let's give money to AIDS.#Quotation
And yet we've had breast cancer problems for years.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, it's just#Uninterpretable
one of those, uh, course, one of the shows I saw was taking it from the angle that, since it doesn't effect men, it's not going to get funded.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, having thought about that for a while,#Statement-non-opinion
What did you think about that idea?#Wh-Question
Well, I, I kind of, I thought, well, that, that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
But then I got, I got to thinking, the, the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate#Statement-non-opinion
and there's only one test that just recently got developed, uh, a blood in-, antigen, uh, antibody test for the antigen in the blood#Statement-non-opinion
and that's fairly recent.#Statement-non-opinion
And yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years.#Statement-non-opinion
They've not really given it attention either,#Summarize/reformulate
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's not really cured,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
it's not, uh, not that heavily funded either#Statement-non-opinion
and then that seems to be one of the, the major, uh, problems that men have in the realm of cancer,#Statement-non-opinion
so, I don't know.#Hedge
I, I guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to. Uh, be it through different organizations, March of Dimes type, uh, telethons or, or bicycle rides or whatever, how they fund whatever, uh, illness they wish.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's kind of hard to, to get an even keel on that.#Statement-opinion
I mean, it's really hard to say,#Statement-opinion
well, there's, you know, a hundred thousand per year affected by this one#Quotation
so let's give it this amount,#Quotation
and then this other one's only a tenth of that,#Quotation
so give it a tenth of that and, and just keep doling it out that way#Quotation
or,#Uninterpretable
Well, I'm, I'm glad I'm not the one that's, that's in charge of, of making those decisions.#Statement-non-opinion
They, uh, you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're all so serious, you know.#Statement-opinion
I mean it's not so serious, I guess, until it affects your family#Statement-opinion
and then all of a sudden it's the most important thing.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I, I would hate to have that responsibility just personally#Statement-non-opinion
but, but then, again, we really, we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address#Statement-opinion
I, uh, I guess I, it, it frightens me to think of so many people with, with AIDS and with cancer#Statement-non-opinion
and many of those things, uh, if they're not able to, to be insured then the country's going to pay for it one way or the other.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Whether it's through prevention or, or treatment or, you know, just, uh, just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves.#Other
It seems like one way or the other we're going to end up paying for it.#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
But#Uninterpretable
You know the, the other thought that I had, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I've had several minutes to think about this after I, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
while I was finding people, I, uh, I could think about the topic longer that the person that receives it,#Statement-non-opinion
so it's kind of a, a unfair advantage,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
as it were,#Other
but, the other thing that I thought of on this is, I wonder if there isn't enough money, uh, in our economy or in our system.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good.#Statement-opinion
I mean, yeah,#Uninterpretable
they're kind of nice.#Statement-opinion
But, we have such an affluent a-, society , society that I wonder if, if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a, a cure for just about everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Just change our p-,#Summarize/reformulate
Of course, then we wouldn't have any room to put people,#Statement-opinion
but that's#Uninterpretable
Right,#Agree/Accept
just change our priorities#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a little bit.#Other
You know, you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza#Statement-non-opinion
or you hear these, these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this, that or the other#Statement-non-opinion
and then you have all the arts that, that are nice and aesthetic,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Rhetorical-Questions
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
are they that enhancing for the, for the masses, you know.#Other
They certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else,#Statement-opinion

Well, we, uh,#Uninterpretable
taxes,#Uninterpretable
everyone thinks taxes are too high I'm sure.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, I think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases.#Statement-opinion
What do you think?#Open-Question
Uh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I think so.#Agree/Accept
I, I'm, uh, I think I'm, I think I'm, uh, a little out of the ordinary in that, that I, I, uh, I think I'm more worried about the deficit, the national deficit than, than, uh, a lot of other people are and think that we need to, we need to either raise our taxes or, or cutback on something#Statement-opinion
and I don't know what to cutback on to,#Statement-non-opinion
At this stage it's hard, to tell.#Statement-opinion
to get, to get that, to get that settled.#Other
And, and, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and, uh, I know I'm a real, a real, uh, out of it in terms of taxes#Other
so I'm no-, I'm, uh, think that the, we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that, uh, for Texas#Statement-opinion
and, and,#Uninterpretable
Well, at this stage I think we've taxed property almost to the limit because,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I think so.#Agree/Accept
like the, the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home because of the cost of the taxes on them.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know#Statement-opinion
I live in Richardson#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But now we're getting public services, the schools, the hospitals#Statement-non-opinion
and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there, uh, look what the schools could cost you.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
now I'm, uh, uh, oh, I,#Uninterpretable
we'd, when we moved to R-, Richardson, one of the reasons we chose it was for the, uh, for the schools. And, and realizing that that, that, that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to, uh, to go for that,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because we supported the,#Other
Then again the, the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent,#Statement-opinion
and the public,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
colleges also, the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country.#Other
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
one of the,#Uninterpretable
uh, I believe, I don't know which one it is, uh, down there whether it's Hobby or, uh, the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition.#Statement-non-opinion
Well if you double the tuition, it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think that's right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That would provide, uh, possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things, see.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The so-called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount,#Statement-opinion
but I p-, eventually I think you may tax people out of smoking even.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
I, I don't, I don't know about that,#Reject
I, I,#Uninterpretable
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I quit ten years ago#Statement-non-opinion
so I,#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No, uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I couldn't afford to start again#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, that, that, that would be true.#Agree/Accept
That would be true.#Agree/Accept
But,#Uninterpretable
I know, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes I think.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But all the various taxing authorities that come through, I think the one tax I resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and, and even if it is, isn't going to, uh, uh, provide you with any, any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your, your home to a business, for instance, you know.#Statement-opinion
Well, this, this is a thing#Statement-opinion
I think it's like, uh, back east.#Statement-opinion
You had to start your public transportation when you started your cities.#Statement-opinion
You can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it.#Statement-opinion
If we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and when land was cheap and, uh, construction costs were cheap, you could afford it.#Other
But now,#Statement-opinion
And,#Uninterpretable
digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and the other thing is that when it, when it's, the public transportation is established that early on then, then the business, uh, business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that.#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
Whereas in, in, uh, in Dallas here we've, we've got, uh, those patterns were well established before, before we really tried to, tried to do the DART.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, for instance all the, all the, the, uh, office buildings and stuff that are out here in, in, uh, north Dallas as opposed to downtown,#Statement-opinion
uh, to try to, to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the, the metroplex to, to, uh, both those centers of, of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, like New York does,#Other
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
New York#Uninterpretable
and some,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car.#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
Someone made the analogy, uh, with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse.#Statement-non-opinion
An old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I'm just as guilty as anyone else.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I drive to work every day by myself, uh, without even, even any thought of car pooling.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, most people are that way.#Statement-opinion
Yep.#Agree/Accept
Because they're used to not having public transportation.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, but I,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
here again I think I resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So and doing all these studies and the things#Other
we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I felt that was a little, uh, wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying, you know.#Statement-opinion
A little bit much.#Agree/Accept
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yep.#Agree/Accept
Yep.#Agree/Accept
Oh, the c-,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's about all I can say at this time.#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
I th-, I think so,#Conventional-closing
I think that will probably do it,#Conventional-closing
so.#Uninterpretable
Okay,#Conventional-closing
it's been real nice talking with you.#Conventional-closing
Good enough.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing

Well, what would you have at a dinner party?#Wh-Question
Well, uh, lately, since I have children I've cut down on having dinner parties#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but when I do I try to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare ahead of time#Statement-non-opinion
uh, I have one recipe for, uh, a really good, um, type of a meatball.#Statement-non-opinion
It's called burgundy meatball#Statement-non-opinion
and it's made with red wine and,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gosh,#Appreciation
um#Uninterpretable
that sounds great.#Other
It's, it's really good#Statement-non-opinion
and you can make it ahead of time and then, um, make the sauce when you're ready to, um, to serve it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's one of my favorite things to, to serve.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, um, I think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party.#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Agree/Accept
But if it was informal, my first choice would be crawfish.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I guess being from that part of the country.#Statement-non-opinion
Because, I mean, crawfish, everybody over here likes crawfish#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, I, I wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my guest.#Other
But if it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
shrimp, shrimp fettucini is real easy#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to, um, make and everything#Other
and it's usually well liked by people, I guess,#Statement-opinion
I'm just a seafood fan#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, how do,#Wh-Question
I think on the lines of,#Other
make, how do you, you cook crawfish?#Other
I, in fact, I just came back from the grocery store#Statement-non-opinion
and being in Texas we don't have too many, you know, people that, that eat crawfish#Statement-non-opinion
but they had live crawfish,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Appreciation
on sale.#Other
um, you're not supposed to, I mean, you're not supposed to eat them dead.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean,#Reject
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, you eat them dead#Other
but,#Uninterpretable
Don't buy them that way#Collaborative Completion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Because if, if they are dead for too long,#Statement-non-opinion
you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you're not supposed to eat those because they're bad for you.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I'll remember that.#Offers, Options Commits
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so if you ever go in a restaurant, order crawfish,#Action-directive
I mean, every once in a while you'll see on-,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident#Statement-non-opinion
but if the tail is straight on it then, yeah,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
don't eat it.#Other
But, um, you just put some Cajun, well, lots of pepper#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you just boil them#Statement-non-opinion
and they're absolutely wonderful#Statement-opinion
but there's, uh, they're a pain to peel for some people.#Statement-non-opinion
Once you get used to it they're real easy#Statement-opinion
but, um, you know, if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot.#Statement-opinion
Huh. When you were, um, whe-, when you serve it do you shell them and then serve em too?#Yes-No-Question
I think for a dinner party#Statement-non-opinion
I, I don't know#Hedge
it depends.#Statement-non-opinion
Um-hum.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like if, like my age, if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party, no, I, they would shell their own,#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, we'd just have crawfish and beer or something#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, if it was more formal like if I was, you know, working environment then I would probably, um, sh-, shell 'em or at least disconnect them from the head#Statement-non-opinion
But there's a,#Statement-non-opinion
Still have see that. *#Other
There's a, big thing over here that everybody sucks the head.#Other
So, um#Statement-non-opinion
Ooh *#Other
it, it would just#Other
.#Non-verbal
depend.#Other
That's the best part of the crawfish.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Sucking the head#Statement-opinion
But um I don't know#Hedge
it jus- i- it just depends on what type it was I guess#Statement-non-opinion
But you can buy uh the crawfish shells already peeled 'n everything#Statement-non-opinion
And usually you use those like for frying#Statement-non-opinion
Um-hum#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or to put in salads or to um You know make a sauce with or something like that#Other
But you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled#Statement-non-opinion
and they're more expensive of course#Statement-non-opinion
but#Uninterpretable
Does it taste a lot like shrimp#Yes-No-Question
Um Yeah#Yes answers
it really does * Looks like a slash unit to me#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like shrimp better * These seems to be independent of A.55 utt 2 above, not a continuation#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just um The crawfish I mean it just has a taste of its own#Statement-non-opinion
It also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use#Statement-non-opinion
Sure#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
stuff like that#Other
but um I think that#Uninterpretable
And also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
all the time#Other
And#Uninterpretable
That's what I need#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept
that's what I wish I had#Statement-non-opinion
but in our family I am the one who who cooks#Statement-non-opinion
And I I really enjoy it#Statement-non-opinion
it's gotten a little more difficult with kids#Statement-non-opinion
But I really do enjoy cooking#Statement-non-opinion
And we um we have them over for dinner#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
back and forth quite a lot#Other
And before I had my second child we sort of had a contest going where#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
.#Other
Oh!#Appreciation
you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I'd try to outdo him#Other
.#Non-verbal
and then he'd try to outdo#Other
.#Non-verbal
me#Other
and we we#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
was really a lot of fun#Statement-non-opinion
I bet#Appreciation
and#Uninterpretable
that that got pretty competitive#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know as#Other
it did#Agree/Accept
far as#Other
we we#Statement-non-opinion
who#Other
tried#Other
could come#Other
to#Other
up#Other
be#Other
with the best recipe#Other
fancier or more courses than the other#Other
That#Statement-opinion
or#Uninterpretable
would be fun#Other
Uh it was a lot of fun you know#Statement-non-opinion
it something unique you know#Statement-non-opinion
and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food#Statement-non-opinion
Uh huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or um sometimes it would be um oh Oh I don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know#Other
It was a lot of fun#Statement-non-opinion
Sometimes it might be the candlelight#Summarize/reformulate
and sometimes it might be the picnic out back#Summarize/reformulate
That's#Agree/Accept
or something#Other
right#Other
Well#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
that's you know that's fun#Other
it was fun#Statement-non-opinion
and and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time#Statement-non-opinion
Uh huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh Just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking#Other
.#Non-verbal
and they were doing all the enjoying#Other
That sounds right I#Statement-opinion
I'm#Uninterpretable
would I'd take him up on that#Other
It does#Agree/Accept
except that knowing them they would probably do something#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
ridiculous and terrible just#Other
.#Non-verbal
just to uh make sure that they didn't have to do it again#Other
Uh huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
I'd#Uninterpretable
make hot#Statement-non-opinion
be#Other
dogs or#Other
.#Non-verbal
some potato chips#Other
I that's about how much I can cook#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
You know#Other
I'm I'm doing a lot more cooking now than I used to#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but that's only because my mom just started working#Statement-non-opinion
so she's tired when she comes home in the afternoon#Statement-non-opinion
so I try to have things cooked for her#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Oh that's nice#Appreciation
uh um I usually try to stay out of kitchen#Other
I don't know#Hedge
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
not one of my favorite hobbies#Statement-non-opinion
It can it can be fun I if you have the time#Statement-opinion
But you know a lot of times it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it#Statement-opinion
Well um#Statement-non-opinion
able#Other
my grandma speaking#Other
to#Other
of those meatballs again she owned every Christmas and and Easter#Other
whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce#Statement-non-opinion
and it has#Uninterpretable
I don't know#Hedge
they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they are absolutely delicious#Other
I don't know what she calls them in#Statement-non-opinion
I don't I'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol#Statement-non-opinion
But#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
um#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
I don't know#Hedge
I would I would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept
it's um it's in the other room#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if we#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
have enough time for it#Other
it's real easy#Statement-non-opinion
one of the unique things in this it's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um whatever seasonings#Statement-non-opinion
you can just light#Action-directive
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so salt and pepper Um and chopped up water chestnuts#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which is something different um#Other
that would be wonderful#Appreciation
makes them a little bit crunchy#Statement-non-opinion
you need to chop em up real fine#Action-directive
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But um it makes them crunchy#Statement-non-opinion
and that adds something new to it#Statement-non-opinion
And then the sauce is just made with um bouillion cubes#Statement-non-opinion
Um-hum#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour#Other
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's not a it's not a thick rich type of a sauce#Statement-non-opinion
it's more of a#Statement-non-opinion
when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um Chinese food#Statement-non-opinion
Um-hum#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that They use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies * Shouldn't this be 2 slash units? I'm confused by the capital letter on "They".#Other
And it gives it a bit of a different consistency#Statement-non-opinion
Well um how long do you cook the meatballs#Wh-Question
The meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until#Action-directive
Uh huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're uh browned on all all sides#Other
and then drain off all the grease#Action-directive
Uh then what I usually do is I freeze them#Statement-non-opinion
And then when#Action-directive
.#Non-verbal
you're ready#Other
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to serve#Other
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
them then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce And heat it#Other
probably you have to heat it up for a good oh#Action-directive
if they're frozen you know it may take a half for them to thaw out#Statement-non-opinion
But then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself#Action-directive
Let them simmer in the sauce itself#Action-directive
Hum#Uninterpretable
and it's real good#Statement-non-opinion
That sounds great#Appreciation
Especially I mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean like if if#Summarize/reformulate
And then freeze them#Collaborative Completion
you are having a dinner party on Wednesday night you could do it on a weekend#Other
Sure#Agree/Accept
That would be great#Statement-opinion
I think I'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because I#Statement-non-opinion

So,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Carnegie Mellon that works out to be, um, a reasonable, a reasonable benefit.#Other
Uh, they do that I think if you're, uh, research here#Statement-non-opinion

and I think that, um, they might, you know, pay for that.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Pay for the classes and stuff#Other
but I know they let you, they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, they'll let you work halftime if you want to, if you want to finish,#Statement-non-opinion
If you want to,#Summarize/reformulate
you want to,#Repeat-phrase
do it quickly.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
They'll let you work, decrease your number of hours by any percentage just, just about so if you want to get your masters#Statement-non-opinion
and then, I think of course you get like a, with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that will probably help out.#Other
But,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I, I don't know in, in terms of other things, other benefits other than sort of monetary#Statement-non-opinion
I'd, you know, I,#Uninterpretable
Do you get any kind of health care type stuff?#Other
Yeah,#Yes answers
we, we do.#Statement-non-opinion
We have to contribute a certain amount, uh, to it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's kind of split between C M U and,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, the employee.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I mean that's pretty, that's a pretty important, uh, part of it there because that, that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems.#Other
My dad, I think my,#Uninterpretable
I'm still covered on, with my dad's, uh, health plan at his, where he works,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's also, right now it's, uh, the,#Uninterpretable
like everywhere else, uh,#Statement-opinion
here in Pittsburgh the health care, uh, rates are, are going up pretty quickly.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's a whole other topic#Statement-non-opinion
They have.#Uninterpretable
to begin with too#Other
but.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
but it's, you are right.#Statement-opinion
I, I, I really agree that, that that's pretty important.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, the only, I think the, I guess the only real, um, benefit I guess you could say working, for me working here, besides I mean#Statement-opinion
I'm learning and stuff because,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm at, you know, in school.#Other
But#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's, there's some weird law where, uh, uh, student employees working for the government#Other
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
don't have to pay Social Security tax.#Other
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Though#Statement-non-opinion
Now that's a big win.#Statement-opinion
that's about,#Other
.#Non-verbal
five percent right there#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's,#Uninterpretable
That's about the only real bonus#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have, so I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid real, you know, because if I was working somewhere else I'd have to, you know, pay an extra five percent,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or so.#Other
I figured for#Uninterpretable
and they've just raised the, um, income caps on Social Security to the point where#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
you have to be pretty, you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
paying that as well.#Other
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
well if you could call it a benefit that C M U, I mean i-,#Statement-non-opinion
the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is, is consult for, um, you know, other companies.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah?#Backchannel in question form
Um, so that's, that kind of helps out in terms of,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, in case,#Statement-non-opinion
help a lot.#Statement-opinion
you know, in case you ever need to bail out#Other

See around, around here it's like, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
we pretty much work from project to project on, well, you know, with different sponsors.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There's not, there is not a whole lot of, you know, funded research from,#Statement-non-opinion

Well, um, I'm, uh, pretty pro gun control over all.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh, I've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I must say that there are a couple of arguments against, uh, strong gun control which I find very compelling, although most the people who argue gun control with me I find, uh, use sort of canned arguments, you know, sort of the N R A slogan arguments#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, uh, see I've been very frustrated when I do debate with people about it. Um,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess on a one, a scale of one of ten I'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns#Statement-non-opinion
and I have to admit most of that is, uh, strong personal distaste.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort. Um,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, me being from Texas#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I hope you're ready for this.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Um, uh, I'll give it a try.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I've got my Texan stereotypes in place.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I'm not your stereotypical Texan.#Statement-non-opinion
I was raised around guns, hunting.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I resp-, I respect them and what their capabilities are.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military, as a Green Beret, I definitely respect the power of weaponry.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's pretty power isn't it ?#Yes-No-Question
And here in Houston, as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country,#Statement-non-opinion
and here, here, here you go,#Hold before answer/agreement
here you,#Uninterpretable
this will be border line N R A which I am not a member of.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
When you, I mean, you've heard the, the slogan, um, if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
That applies to anything as well as guns.#Statement-opinion
a gun.#Uninterpretable
Well, you, you've got,#Uninterpretable
well, any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs#Statement-opinion
and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they get out their little Mac tens,#Statement-opinion
they get out their little uzis#Statement-opinion
and they're going to fight with them.#Statement-opinion
And it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm.#Statement-opinion
If they want it they'll get it.#Statement-opinion
I don't care if, if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it#Statement-opinion
they'll get it#Statement-opinion
and they'll get across the border.#Statement-opinion
Now my position, although, I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
anyway.#Other
Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a felony, if I wanted to buy one, I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it.#Statement-opinion
If they want to run a background check on me, fine.#Statement-non-opinion
If they want to put a seven day waiting period, fine, again.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If they want, want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that I've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county, that's fine too.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What I don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it's it wouldn't,#Statement-opinion
you don't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way, I would hope. I mean, because I mean someone#Statement-opinion
the personal sheriff doesn't like doesn't get to have a gun#Statement-non-opinion
and someone the personal sheriff,#Uninterpretable
Well,#Uninterpretable
,#Non-verbal
the only, well, the criteria the sheriff would have to follow has, is this guy a convicted felon? Uh,#Statement-opinion
is he a habitual trouble maker?#Quotation
Are we picking him up every Saturday,#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for a drunk and disorderly#Other
and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems.#Quotation
You know, just proving that you're a basically a good citizen.#Statement-opinion
But if you're not a, if you're not a basically good citizen,#Statement-opinion
you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway.#Statement-opinion
If, if they want the firepower they can get it.#Statement-opinion
So why hav-,#Uninterpretable
because it doesn't matter how restrictive your border control points are#Statement-opinion
they'll get it across the border one way or the other.#Statement-opinion
So why have any restrictions at all?#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Let-,#Uninterpretable
go back to that one to ten scale where one,#Action-directive

I'd said about an eight.#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, we can could be,#Uninterpretable
I said the restrictions I would like to see on, for anybody, whether it being for handgun, a rifle, a shotgun,#Statement-non-opinion
I would like to see them go through either,#Statement-non-opinion
I'd like to see a law enforcement agency, not N R A,#Statement-non-opinion
but whether it be the, your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun.#Statement-opinion
You got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon, how to safely handle the weapon, how to properly maintain it, the three basics.#Statement-opinion
Well, that makes a lot of since to me.#Agree/Accept
I mean, I certainly feel that if, if, we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do, use it safely as someone learns how to drive, if not more so.#Agree/Accept
Well, the han-,#Uninterpretable
in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon,#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as a, as a pistol.#Other
Well, I have a bicycle#Statement-non-opinion
and that scares me too to tell you the truth because I've been run off the road and all sorts of things.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I'm still, I'm still puzzled though, what is the argument,#Wh-Question
how does the argument work if, uh, if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway.#Wh-Question
What's the point of putting a restrictio-,#Wh-Question
basically, the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway#Statement-opinion
they're not going to take those courses.#Statement-opinion
Is it, uh, is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns?#Yes-No-Question
Well there's,#Uninterpretable
If it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices#Statement-opinion
does that, uh, mean advantage?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, not necessarily a price thing.#Negative non-no answers
What is happening at least in this state#Statement-non-opinion
and I expect to see it in other states very soon,#Statement-opinion
legislation been introduced as that, if a citizen of the state, being,#Statement-non-opinion

if I walk into a bad neighborhood I'm sure I'd want to walk through with you because I'm sure you have good, you know, fa-, far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I'm, quite concerned that if you let everyone#Statement-opinion
hasn't yet used a gun in a, haven't, hasn't yet committed a felony,#Statement-opinion
if you let them all walk around carrying guns#Statement-opinion
in this sort of wild west scenario, you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature.#Statement-opinion
You're going to start getting a lot of gunfire.#Statement-opinion
It's, it's hard for me to imagine that a, a situation of, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
take it to a logical extreme,#Action-directive
if everyone walking around carrying a guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire.#Statement-opinion
I, actually it's no-,#Uninterpretable
it's more of a police action in itself,#Statement-opinion
the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying, well, I'm going to mug this guy right here#Statement-opinion
but hey, he's carrying just as much firepower as I can.#Quotation
And if they're sca-, if you got to go through a certification course to get where, to where you can carry it in public,#Statement-opinion

And the only reason I feel confid-, com-, com-, comfortable doing that is because of the training I've had.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well as, as someone who would, would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander, I feel more comfortable with people having blades because, uh, you're not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly#Statement-non-opinion

that, we went to the reunion in end of Jul-, June and first of July#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that part#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the fourth of July weekend,#Other
but we had to plan everything like clear in December, January#Statement-non-opinion
Sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to reserve that.#Other
Now was this his entire family, cousins, aunts, uncles#Or-Clause
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like that or his immediate family?#Other
No#No answers
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
this was everybody.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh wow,#Appreciation
how many people were there?#Wh-Question
Oh, I, oh, I, jeez, I think over, um, three hundred#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
were there.#Other
It was quite a large#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
it was a great big lodge,#Statement-non-opinion
and so we had plenty of room and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
and some of them live in that area,#Statement-non-opinion
so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um, that was a great big thing,#Statement-non-opinion
and we do that with his family about every five years,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh that's,#Other
a great big one.#Other
wonderful, oh.#Other
And then like immediate family we do, like we try to do one thing once a year.#Statement-non-opinion
Now how many, how many people are in his immediate family?#Wh-Question
Well, he has eight brothers and sisters#Statement-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
so that's big by itself.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow,#Appreciation
it really is,#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
and you get together once a year.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Wow,#Appreciation
So we have a little shindig with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Are they all here in the area,#Yes-No-Question
or are they#Or-Clause
Um#Statement-non-opinion
scattered?#Other
they're close, in a close proximity.#Other
Um, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
there are four of them who live here in Texas, and his mom and dad.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, um, the others live in close neighboring, um, states, like Nevada, Arizona#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think like that,#Other
yeah#Uninterpretable
Oh wow,#Appreciation
that's wonderful.#Statement-non-opinion
so, it's been fun.#Statement-non-opinion
How about you?#Open-Question
Well, we don't really get together,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I would love to,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's why I checked that I wanted to do that, because I would love to plan a family reunion sometime.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I have a sister in Colorado, and, uh, a sister in upstate New York, and a sister in Connecticut, and here I am in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
So we're kind of scattered right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, my, my cousins have a, you know, they put on a family reunion, um, once a year,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's always like the second week in September,#Statement-non-opinion
so it's,#Uninterpretable
the kids are already back in school#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so, and that's back in the#Statement-non-opinion
That's hard.#Appreciation
and that's in New York,#Statement-non-opinion
and there's no way, I mean there's#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just no possible way.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's not really a weekend,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just like a day kind of thing, because most of them are, you know, um,#Statement-non-opinion
my family moved to Connecticut,#Statement-non-opinion
the rest of the family stayed in New York#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, on Long Island,#Other
and so, they're all kind of local and close,#Statement-non-opinion
and so they just have a, you know, a day picnic,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I've always thought it would be so neat, even if it were just my immediate family, to have like a weekend type thing#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that would be so wonderful#Statement-non-opinion
It really is fun,#Statement-non-opinion
and my mom's family does it once a year, just like you said#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
once a year, um, they have a, a, a Wednesday through a, a Saturday type thing.#Statement-non-opinion
You can come and go as you please type thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
And they do that once a year.#Statement-non-opinion
I kind of missed it this year, and felt bad,#Statement-non-opinion
but you can't go every year,#Statement-opinion
you just#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
cannot do that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And do they, they have a hotel,#Yes-No-Question
or where do you stay?#Or-Clause
Um, basically, they just stay with each other, brothers or sisters.#Statement-non-opinion
There are enough in the area to, to just kind of span yourself out.#Statement-non-opinion
Take everybody,#Collaborative Completion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Whoever's mom and dad it is, you usually go and stay with them,#Statement-non-opinion
like I go stay with my mother,#Statement-non-opinion
and my cousins, they just go stay with their mom and dad, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
kind of thing.#Other
And so it's not hard in, in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that's not hard,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that sounds so wonderful,#Appreciation
isn't that nice.#Rhetorical-Questions
the real planning, that's the real key#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they send out,#Statement-non-opinion
my mom's family now,#Statement-non-opinion
this is the first reunion with my husband's family I've really been involved with,#Statement-non-opinion
but my mom's family, each brother and sister takes a turn one year,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's how they divide it up#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then,#Other
But then one brother and sister from each family.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, she has ten in that family#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and each one of them take their turn.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow,#Appreciation
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then the, the parent who's turn it is, the child whose turn it is#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
her children help her,#Other
like if it was my mother's turn#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see, uh-huh.#Appreciation
all of us children would help her#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
put it on#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
kind of thing.#Other
Oh, wow,#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, the thing is, that, um, the, the real part is there are two mailings that go out,#Statement-non-opinion
and the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making,#Statement-non-opinion

All right.#Other
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think we're terribly taxed.#Statement-opinion
I, I think the Republicans have taxed us just as much as the Democrats,#Statement-opinion
and I don't think there's a change between one party than the other.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I think we get a lot back,#Statement-opinion
but not as much as we should.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I guess what I feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it, there's got to be something.#Statement-opinion
When, when we pay so much for the, for the debt, instead of using the money for where#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it ought to go, it, it's just, it's ridiculous.#Other
What kills me is when they had a chance to, to, uh, put into ac-, action the, the g-, the Glen-, Rub-,#Uninterpretable
what is it, uh, the act where they had to cut everything across the board#Wh-Question
The Gramm, the Gramm Rudman Act.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
they kept doing, they kept putting off doing that.#Statement-opinion
Why did they do that?#Rhetorical-Questions
That's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well I think they spend too much.#Statement-opinion
They, they spend too much on themselves, too,#Statement-opinion
the, the,#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think so too.#Agree/Accept
A lot of the, the taxes gets back to the members of the Congress and everything all running for twenty years, rather than.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well. Things like mailings.#Statement-opinion
They don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things.#Statement-opinion
They just think once they get there that they can do just anything.#Statement-opinion
No,#Reject
they don't, they don't try to, uh#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
you're right.#Agree/Accept
to conserve.#Other
And of course, here at home, we end up conserving and conserving#Statement-opinion
and, I mean, when I don't have money, I don't buy something.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
no#Agree/Accept
I think, uh, it is the Congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money, uh,#Statement-opinion
They sure don't seem to.#Agree/Accept
The national debt is terrible.#Statement-opinion
Uh,#Uninterpretable
There are a couple of things I think we need to really work for,#Statement-opinion
and I don't know quite how to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
But I think we need to have the one line, uh, uh, veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything.#Statement-opinion
If it's a good idea#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it can be done again.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and if it's not, so what.#Statement-opinion
At least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months.#Statement-opinion
I saw one on TWENTY TWENTY about a month ago I guess, whereas one, I think that he was a Senator from Pennsylvania or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Maybe it was, uh, Connecticut,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not sure,#Statement-non-opinion
one of the small states up there, where he had a bill through for another, uh, a drug agency that would be located there,#Statement-non-opinion
and he was the only one that wanted it.#Statement-non-opinion
Was going to cost millions of dollars.#Statement-non-opinion
The drug agency didn't want it,#Statement-non-opinion
and he was going to build it in his home town#Statement-non-opinion
and they were going to hire a lot of people,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and it was ridiculous, you know, the whole thing#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
this is, that's right.#Agree/Accept
And, and, you know, they asked him about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you really need this?#Quotation
This is going to cost a lot of money.#Quotation
Oh yes#Quotation
we need it.#Quotation
But do you know that the drug agency doesn't want this?#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they do things that are, you know, just like the, uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept
that.#Agree/Accept
And the trouble is, you don't, you have so little input about it.#Statement-opinion
You don't know#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
enough to know what, what to do about some of this stuff.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
They're supposed to do what we say,#Statement-opinion
but they do what they, they want to do with it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
The other thing about is I think, uh, limiting their time in office would be good.#Statement-opinion
I, I just#Statement-non-opinion
Absolutely,#Agree/Accept
absolutely.#Agree/Accept
can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got.#Other
We need to get that through.#Statement-opinion
We, we have said that, I've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two yea-, two terms is enough for all of them.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, whether you're mayor, all the way up, city council, the works, I think. Certainly President, that, uh, two terms is plenty.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I think that's right.#Agree/Accept
And then we get these professionals out of there,#Statement-opinion
and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves, you know, rather than#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
wouldn't that be too bad#Statement-opinion
living off of us.#Other
Well, that's right.#Agree/Accept
I think,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
I think, uh, people in general,#Statement-opinion
the, the, the idea of what you need to, to exist is so outrageous that it's not#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
hardly.#Other
You know, it starts at the courts,#Statement-opinion
it starts everywhere#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
until we can't, we've just lost control of, of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, you know.#Other
Well, it's so much money#Statement-opinion
and you can't even add it up, you know,#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
you can't even,#Statement-opinion
that's why they think,#Statement-opinion
can't even conceive of what they're talking about.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
when you talk about the trillions of dollars#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on this and that.#Other
Our national#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
debt in the trillions of dollars, you know.#Other
I mean it jus-, and, and you just,#Uninterpretable
the other thing is, it's, it's all very well to give money to help people, other people,#Statement-opinion
and I think we need to do that.#Statement-opinion
But there are, they need to put more limits on them.#Statement-opinion
They need to restrain#Statement-opinion
Foreign aid,#Collaborative Completion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
about what they do.#Other
Foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless it's absolutely#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
necessary.#Other
They, they've given that away for fifty years.#Statement-opinion
I, I, you know, I think that's probably, un-, unless we can afford it,#Statement-opinion
if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again.#Statement-opinion
I agree,#Agree/Accept
I agree.#Agree/Accept
You know, I don't really mind helping people,#Statement-non-opinion
but you, you need to get rid of this thing that's, that's just, uh, eating us up#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, and get things on a, on an even,#Other
if it were, if it were a family, we'd be up before the, the magistrate#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for, for doing all these wicked things, you know,#Other
but the government does it,#Statement-opinion
and it's all right.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I know we're taxed to death on every, every thing.#Statement-opinion
I don't know what's the best way to do it,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, they don't even talk about that.#Statement-opinion
They just raise it.#Statement-opinion
They don't even consider it, like you saying#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
to cut something back, you know.#Other
Well, sounds like.#Uninterpretable
They are at least doing something now, with the, the military, you know,#Statement-opinion
they're cutting some of that,#Statement-non-opinion
but of course, now, you know T I,#Statement-opinion
you know that's hurting us but although,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's good to see them doing some things there anyway.#Statement-opinion
But T I has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else.#Statement-opinion
And if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic, uh#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
weapon systems.#Other
But, uh, that's the only good that I've seen Congress do, you know, and everybody#Statement-non-opinion
Well.#Uninterpretable
and all the Congressmen and the President and everybody, uh,#Other
I think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens, we're going to have to bite the bullet.#Statement-opinion
And we're all going to have to do it.#Statement-opinion
I, it just isn't fair, though, that when this happens in some places, it needs to all come off everywhere.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
That's why I thought, well, you know, this is the time.#Statement-non-opinion
They need to put that into act-, into action and show they mean business. That they've got to cut, they've got to cut costs.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
The only taxes I think that are well spent,#Statement-opinion
well not the only, but, uh,#Uninterpretable
I think the, now I, I don't understand the present school thing,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I have two daughters,#Statement-non-opinion
one's in college already,#Statement-non-opinion
and one's about to be in high school.#Statement-non-opinion
But uh, I think that paying for school, schools is the, schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime.#Statement-opinion
And so I don't mind paying for school#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think that's right.#Agree/Accept
taxes even though my kids will be out of it, you know.#Other
Well, I don't, I don't really mind paying taxes for, for positive things that are helps, like roads and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
making sure that, uh, that water is safe, and some of these things.#Other
But, um, you know, it, you just feel like it's out of control.#Statement-opinion
You feel like#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they do not have control of it.#Other
The spending is out of control.#Statement-opinion
And that, and so then it just aggravates you, you know,#Statement-opinion
you think, I could spend my money,#Statement-opinion
I could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing.#Quotation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
oh, I agree with you.#Agree/Accept
So it's,#Uninterpretable
I, I think that's a wide open subject#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what you said.#Other
People need to take a stand.#Statement-opinion
I think the people will here shortly, uh.#Statement-opinion
Well, I think that's right.#Agree/Accept
If they don't do, if they don't, if they don't pull it in and start doing something, I think they're really going to have to I think.#Statement-opinion
I think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out, too, that, what they did last election,#Statement-opinion
and, uh, ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in, you know,#Statement-opinion
so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes, you know.#Statement-opinion
They're supposed to represent us.#Statement-opinion
That's what they're called#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they don't.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
May, may, may, maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there, guys and gals whatever they are.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in some ways we're awful lucky I guess.#Statement-opinion
There a lot of, lot of places where it's worse than it is here.#Statement-non-opinion
But#Statement-opinion
I know,#Agree/Accept
but it.#Uninterpretable
still, you don't want it to get that bad, good heavens.#Other
No,#Agree/Accept
that's right,#Agree/Accept
you don't want to,#Agree/Accept
No,#Agree/Accept
you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be.#Statement-opinion
we need to get, try to get hold of it and, and have it be, things be honest#Statement-opinion
and, I guess, in the fact I don't really mind paying taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
But I would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent. That they're doing something that's positive for#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for somebody.#Other
I don't really feel like, uh, I don't really feel like I use taxes very much#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know#Hedge
maybe#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's, you're right.#Agree/Accept
I do more than I,#Other
I guess I do.#Statement-non-opinion
I use them in the, in roads and lot of things,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh.#Uninterpretable
Well I think one of the good ones in the metroplex, uh, in the last say twenty-five years or so, maybe longer, they've built all these dams.#Statement-opinion
You know, the Corps of Engineers have, uh, soon as they finish a lake, they'll go at, get another one.#Statement-non-opinion
And that we haven't had, we've had droughts here in long summers#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we've had good water supply,#Statement-opinion
and that's due to the Corps of Engineers building, looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they've done some good things.#Agree/Accept
The state actually did some good, good work on that, in that a couple of years ago.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, Sam Johnson came out and talked to us about that#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
about what they had done.#Other
And they, they really had done some good, some good work.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think anything for water supply like that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
California should do more of that too.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
there are a lot of p-, places where they're in real trouble,#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too, if they don't take, if they don't take that early stand.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
They just finished Joe Poole Lake over here,#Statement-non-opinion
and they need to start another one.#Statement-opinion
I think every time they finish one they ought to just have#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
another one in line.#Other
The water's critical.#Statement-opinion
that's probably right.#Agree/Accept
The growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait until something#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
til they need them.#Other
Well, it's good to talk to you.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
yeah.#Uninterpretable
How many calls have you made?#Conventional-closing
Oh, about nine.#Conventional-closing
Oh yeah,#Conventional-closing
I'm up to twenty.#Conventional-closing
Are you a T I -er.#Conventional-closing
No,#Conventional-closing
I just, just a housewife.#Conventional-closing
I just heard about it and found it fun#Conventional-closing
Oh, well, great,#Conventional-closing
great,#Conventional-closing
okay.#Uninterpretable
Guess I like to talk, that's all#Conventional-closing
Well, it's been some interesting subjects,#Conventional-closing
yeah.#Conventional-closing
Right.#Conventional-closing
Thanks for calling.#Conventional-closing
Uh-huh.#Conventional-closing
Bye now#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay,#Other
let's talk about schooling.#Action-directive
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Uh, what, what contacts do you have with the public school sy-,#Open-Question
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I have a boy#Statement-non-opinion
and he just went into middle school,#Statement-non-opinion
and I have a girl,#Statement-non-opinion
and she's in, uh, grade school,#Statement-non-opinion
and then I have a little boy who goes to, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
they have something just before kindergarten,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's called Early Childhood,#Statement-non-opinion
and I have a young#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
a young boy in that.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I, I have a lot of children in, in the school system down here.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, I think we have excellent teachers here.#Statement-non-opinion
I am really, uh,#Uninterpretable
like the stu-, like the way the teachers work with the students.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I've not been so, um, happy with the schools themselves, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
Like, my, last year, my son and daughter were in the same grade school#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
before he moved up to middle school,#Other
and it was just packed.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it was a, a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was just a real problem.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, so we had to do a bond issue and, and, um, vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that's what the prefer to do, or to, uh, work on the, work for another school to be built, which is a good idea,#Statement-non-opinion
but in the meantime, the school still has lots and lots of kids in it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, um, I think one thing is that would,#Uninterpretable
maybe we don't have enough schools,#Statement-opinion
and secondly, when we have enough schools, sometimes we can't get the, the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers.#Statement-opinion
Well, I think that's, I think that's, uh, true.#Agree/Accept
I, I've got a little different, uh, contact,#Statement-non-opinion
but I've, I've got a, one son that graduated from high school last year#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and another son that's a, a sophomore this year#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, my wife teaches kindergarten here in Richardson.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, great.#Appreciation
Uh, but, in general, I, I think the, the, you know, one of the reasons that we, we, uh, the, chose to live in Richardson when we, when we came here was the, was the schools,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think that Plano and Richardson in terms of the, uh, things seriously wrong with the public schools are not nearly to the extent th-, that#Statement-opinion
We see through the, out the country.#Collaborative Completion
uh, right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
And I think, I think part of that is that, is the, the, uh, a big part of that is just the demographics,#Statement-opinion
the population in those schools are, are, typically, uh, people that very much value the education and support#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the, the school systems#Other
I think that's right.#Agree/Accept
and, and, uh, although there's still some, still some problems,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I, you know, I, when I was, when I was going to school,#Statement-non-opinion
I grew up in Iowa,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, in my family, school was certainly valued,#Statement-non-opinion
but if there was ever any sort of a, uh, if ev-, if I was ever in trouble in school, I was also in trouble at home#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even more so,#Other
and I think that part of it is, is not exactly with the schools, but with the, with the, uh#Statement-opinion
The home,#Collaborative Completion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
the culture that doesn't, doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support, uh#Other
I think that's right.#Agree/Accept
what the schools are, are trying to do.#Other
It is so hard with a family system, um, either divorced or, or just one parent#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
or just li-,#Other
and then, if both of them have to work, even that is a, a hard situation#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for the children, uh, to, to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I think it's real important that the parents work with the school, um#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think what you said is, is really a pinpoint, though, that the student and the family life really adds or detracts#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what's happening in the school#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, um, what about your wife,#Open-Question
is she, she happy at school#Yes-No-Question
or .#Uninterpretable
Well, uh, she, she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher.#Statement-non-opinion
I bet she does.#Appreciation
She has, she has two half day classes.#Statement-non-opinion
So she#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
has, uh, you know, on the order of twice as many students as#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as the teachers in the higher grades#Other
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and uh, uh, but her, her background is in, is in, uh, child development, and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, so forth,#Other
and so kindergarten is as high as she, as she wants to teach,#Statement-non-opinion
and she's#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she's teaching rather than something else because that, that, that's the jobs that are available and that, the schedule matches, uh, you know, with our kids and things like that.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, and, but, uh, the ...#Uninterpretable

Go ahead#Action-directive
Uh, have you every been tested for a new job or anything?#Or-Clause
Uh, no#No answers
I haven't.#Statement-non-opinion
But, in my job, I'm a nurse, and we are allowed to be.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you know, this is the rules that they can do this anytime.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested.#Statement-non-opinion
So it's just sort of, uh,#Uninterpretable
they can if they,#Uninterpretable
They can if they choose to.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Have you, well wai-, have you had any experience with it at all?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, not really#Negative non-no answers
but I've always worked on a university level#Statement-non-opinion
but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So what do you think about that?#Open-Question
Uh, I don't, I don't think they're very accurate#Statement-opinion
because, I mean, I know their lifestyles changed p-, prior to the drug test#Statement-non-opinion
and I know they changed afterwards.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
See I know of that too.#Statement-non-opinion
And I also know that things like antihistamines, Sudafeds, things like that, can really throw it off.#Statement-non-opinion
And you cannot get a job because of it#Statement-non-opinion
and they may not tell you the reason why. *#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I had a friend,#Statement-non-opinion
it didn't cause her any problems with her job#Statement-non-opinion
but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
But what it was, was she had been u-, she had been, uh, in the jungle#Statement-non-opinion
and it was some Malaria medication#Statement-non-opinion
and she tested positive for that.#Statement-non-opinion
See, and so it really is a dangerous thing that way#Statement-opinion
because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job#Statement-non-opinion
and they weren't told why.#Statement-non-opinion
But a lot of people say the reason why, after you take a physical, will be because of the drug testing#Statement-opinion
or they would tell you.#Statement-opinion
Or this person never use any drugs.#Statement-opinion
See, I always,#Uninterpretable
I thought they got, you got called back if you tested positive, for more tests.#Statement-opinion
Uh, you should.#Statement-opinion
Because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something.#Statement-opinion
I have real mixed feelings about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know.#Statement-non-opinion
How, do you know how wrong they are?#Yes-No-Question
Are they, I mean, is there a margin of error?#Yes-No-Question
The accuracy?#Signal-non-understanding
I don't know.#Other answers
I don't know.#Other answers
But, I know there are a lot of things that can influence them#Statement-non-opinion
and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And if you could show that,#Statement-opinion
I, I interviewed for a job recently#Statement-non-opinion
and I was taking Entex.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And my doctor gave me a prescription for it.#Other
And he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive, you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
And it didn't come up that I needed to do it#Statement-non-opinion
but this could happen to anybody#Statement-opinion
and if they would just say oh, this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know. Then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I don't know.#Hedge
And I, I'm not so sure they are that needed.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I'm not#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, *#Uninterpretable
sure either.#Other
The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it, then they have the right to go ahead and prove it#Statement-opinion
because they say they can spot check.#Statement-non-opinion
Ye-, *#Other
if you're using it while at a job, I can see a problem.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But the occasional person, then it's almost like, it's almost an infringement of your privacy.#Statement-opinion
Well, it sort of is.#Maybe/Accept-part
And this is it,#Other
this,#Uninterpretable
I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, as a health professional, I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, so as a patient, I feel well, yeah, we probably should be protected.#Statement-opinion
But, on the other hand, there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too.#Statement-opinion
So#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, I guess you sort of, you have to have trust some place along the way.#Other
You can't go around testing everybody for everything.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I don't know.#Statement-non-opinion
And I, I think it could be used to hassle somebody.#Statement-opinion
If someone was out to get you, I think that a company or a boss could use this.#Statement-opinion
You know, they could keep on doing this to you or something, I guess.#Statement-opinion
I can see where it could become a problem.#Statement-opinion
And it, it's like, it seems like now they have tests#Statement-opinion
I guess they can test your hair#Statement-non-opinion
and they can find out if you use drugs#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
up to several years ago.#Other
Oh, wow! But *#Appreciation
So,#Uninterpretable
maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. *#Other
I know.#Agree/Accept
That's the other thing.#Other
I mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
There's a lot of things you do as a kid that#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you wouldn't do as an adult#Other
but#Statement-opinion
I think that's true.#Agree/Accept
you can't say it was wrong at the time.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
So that probably wouldn't be too good either.#Statement-opinion

Do you see anything wrong with public school systems?#Yes-No-Question
Well, yes,#Yes answers
I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I think I'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to, to deal with in some quality way.#Statement-non-opinion
I think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job.#Statement-opinion
I agree.#Agree/Accept
Do you?#Yes-No-Question
Do you have children in the public school system?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
and I taught for fourteen years#Statement-non-opinion
Is that right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
before we moved to Texas,#Other
and the, the one thing I see is changing is I was held accountable so much#Statement-non-opinion
I had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students,#Statement-non-opinion
and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that I was filling out all these forms#Statement-non-opinion
You were a bookkeeper#Summarize/reformulate
for all the children#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
everything had to be documented,#Statement-non-opinion
and I had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids,#Statement-non-opinion
it was filled with documentation#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
yes.#Agree/Accept
Well, um, I'm, I have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and I'm just really in a dilemma if that's what, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I love to work with children and#Statement-non-opinion
Me, too.#Statement-non-opinion
to teach them,#Other
but I'm really having questions if, if I can deal with that system and, and have a good conscience about, you know, what I do.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't think, I don't think it's the teachers,#Statement-opinion
I think it's the system#Statement-opinion
I think so too.#Agree/Accept
but, um.#Uninterpretable
They're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and teacher competency, you know,#Other
and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best,#Statement-opinion
she's always worried who's looking over her shoulder#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
What child's going to say something#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
some parent's going to overreact to#Other
I know.#Agree/Accept
that's, that's true.#Agree/Accept
Well, it's, it's hard on the children too,#Statement-opinion
I think, you know, because the, um, the teachers are overworked#Statement-opinion
and just like a mommy that's overworked#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
you're not at your best, you know, um.#Other
Do you have children in the system?#Yes-No-Question
I have two,#Affirmative non-yes answers
I have, in the system#Affirmative non-yes answers
one is in ninth grade#Statement-non-opinion
and one is in seventh grade,#Statement-non-opinion
and them,#Uninterpretable
um, I'm home schooling my kindergartner this year.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
We, um, live in a district that has open classrooms,#Statement-non-opinion
and I wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her.#Statement-non-opinion
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Are you in Plano?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Yep,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I am too.#Statement-non-opinion
You too.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I have one in ninth grade at Clark#Statement-non-opinion
and one at Hendrick this year,#Statement-non-opinion
and he, my nin-, my, uh, sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews,#Statement-non-opinion
and the very first year I taught back in seventy-three, we had open classroom#Statement-non-opinion
and it didn't work then#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and when we moved down here, I was just appalled that they were still doing#Statement-non-opinion
Still at it.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it here,#Other
Well the explanation I was, was given about, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
they, they seemed to admit that it wasn't working,#Statement-non-opinion
but they didn't have the money to restructure,#Statement-non-opinion
but looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with, I mean, some kind of partitions#Statement-opinion
Partitions#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
or just to face the children different directions or to do something#Statement-opinion
Just,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Uninterpretable
I know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, goodness.#Appreciation
so he spent all day#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in this one large open area,#Other
so, I didn't really care for that.#Statement-non-opinion
It seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here.#Statement-non-opinion
Were they?#Backchannel in question form
That was our last tour, in Michigan.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, we were from North, um, Carolina,#Statement-non-opinion
and of course North, North Carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education.#Statement-non-opinion
I think they rank about forty-ninth#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but our children got a very good education there#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they were in the magnet school program,#Statement-non-opinion
and a lot of their classes, from the time they were about third grade, they, they changed classes several times during the day, which has its pros and cons,#Statement-non-opinion
but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
and it was wonderful#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
so, you know, I'm coming to, to Plano thinking, Well, gosh, it's going to be really great,#Statement-non-opinion
it's ranked so much better#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
We heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system.#Statement-non-opinion
Isn't that interesting,#Appreciation
I, I, I don't understand how they get this, this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money,#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
Probably so, on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are#Agree/Accept
I guess so.#Agree/Accept
so.#Uninterpretable
Well, my son is at Clark this year too,#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh, we're#Uninterpretable
As a freshman?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, he's pleased with his classes.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I, I don't guess I've been in the high school long enough to, to know what to expect really#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, how to judge it.#Other
My daughter seems to be having a good time,#Statement-non-opinion
she was absent with strep throat the last three days,#Statement-non-opinion
and I ran over and picked up her report card,#Statement-non-opinion
and she did very good,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work I would expect#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for a freshman to have.#Other
She's not bogged down,#Statement-non-opinion
but yet she has some every night.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, Eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any,#Statement-non-opinion
so, that's interesting,#Appreciation
but, he, his grades, I haven't seen them yet,#Statement-non-opinion
but supposedly they're good,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you always hear how good.#Statement-opinion
Now my son's at,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful#Other
but,#Rhetorical-Questions
.#Non-verbal
who knows what he's going to bring home.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept

Okay.#Other
Okay,#Repeat-phrase
that made a nice ugly sound.#Statement-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Your name is Lynn?#Yes-No-Question
Linda.#Negative non-no answers
Linda.#Repeat-phrase
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, sounds like you like to read.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I read quite a bit, probably don't read as much as I would like to.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't read as much as I would like to either.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, I'm a single mom,#Statement-non-opinion
but I have always loved reading.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What do you like to read?#Open-Question
Um, well um, I'm a, I'm a counselor, a therapist by trade,#Hold before answer/agreement
so most of my books are, um, I guess what you'd call self improvement type of books.#Statement-non-opinion
That what I've been reading lately a lot of.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, my interests switch around dramatically.#Statement-non-opinion
I used to read just, mainly fic-, fiction,#Statement-non-opinion
and now I, lik-, like a said, I've read a lot of self, self help books.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What kind of things have you read?#Wh-Question
Oh, I read all kinds of things for, um, helping people survive a divorce.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED was probably one of my favorites.#Statement-non-opinion
Have you read that?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, I haven't gotten through it yet.#Negative non-no answers
You haven't?#Backchannel in question form
No.#No answers
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what would you recommend?#Wh-Question
Um, as far as dealing with divorce?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, I'm kind of getting that one past me, but a good self help book.#Negative non-no answers
Good self help.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, um probably the best one that I, I know of and I work with all the time is called SEARCH FOR SIGNIFICANCE#Statement-non-opinion
Um, that sounds good.#Appreciation
by Robert McGee#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's one that we use in our work.#Statement-non-opinion
It's probably one you'd find in like a Christian book store.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know what the chains are down there. Maybe in the mall family book store, something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm writing it down.#Statement-non-opinion
That does soun-, that's sound really good.#Appreciation
Um, what kind of counseling do you do,#Wh-Question
or should we stay on the topic of books?#Yes-No-Question
Um, probably should stay on the topic,#Affirmative non-yes answers
but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that I read#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I'm a therapist for Rossa.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a Christian treatment organization#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
and because of that I see, uh, work with adolescents specifically,#Statement-non-opinion
so I see a lot of kids with, with various problems.#Statement-non-opinion
Right now some of the things I'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse,#Statement-non-opinion
so a lot of the books I've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I would imagine helping them feel good about themselves#Statement-opinion
they're at a bad stage anyway,#Statement-opinion
and then to have to deal with sexual abuse#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
would be terrible, as a teen.#Other
That's, uh, that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, sometimes it's rewarding,#Dispreferred answers
and, and sometimes it's a struggle.#Dispreferred answers
Oh, I'm sure,#Appreciation
I'm sure.#Appreciation
Uh, what oth-,#Uninterpretable
is, is that just the only type of reading you've been doing,#Yes-No-Question
or do you, have you read any good novels lately?#Or-Clause
Um, I guess I've got so many books like that that I need to read#Statement-non-opinion
it's, it's hard for me to do a lot of, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
just joy reading.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
reading, yeah, reading just for enjoyment.#Other
I hear you there,#Appreciation
that's for sure. Um,#Appreciation
In fact,#Uninterpretable
I guess, the last book I've read,#Statement-non-opinion
my oldest daughter had to read LOST HORIZONS for her English class,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I just realized I had never read it growing up.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I just finished reading that for enjoyment.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, that's neat.#Appreciation
And it wa-, it was good.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, she, she's not, didn't enjoy it much,#Statement-non-opinion
so I didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her.#Statement-non-opinion
But I thought it was real interesting.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, because I enjoyed some of those stories so much,#Other
but I never seem to have the time to do#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
that kind of reading.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I trying to think of some of my other favorite books,#Hold before answer/agreement
but, I, I keep lists,#Statement-non-opinion
I must have a list of, oh, two hundred, three hundred books that I want to read.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just like, I want to read that and I write it down.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've got a stack next to my bed#Statement-non-opinion
So do I.#Statement-non-opinion
I tend to get a little bit of ways in a book#Statement-non-opinion
and then I, I get distracted, and, or have to start on another one,#Statement-non-opinion
it's pretty tough to keep up with.#Statement-opinion
I was trying to think of,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I've got a copy of THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED#Statement-non-opinion
but I was trying to think, there's another Scott book that I've got that I had read.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, He, he also wrote PEOPLE OF THE LIE.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's the one I was thinking of.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I bought that one,#Statement-non-opinion
and I didn't get into, involved in that one as well.#Statement-non-opinion
There's another one he wrote that even sounds better,#Statement-opinion
and it's kind of the whole concept of global peace, you know, like, and communities#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
building communities.#Other
Someone just recently said something really neat about that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I got involved in, uh, Beginning Experience Weekends,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it was of the people from there that said that.#Statement-non-opinion
His latest book, and I can't recall the name of it, is just excellent,#Statement-non-opinion
and his whole idea is, we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects.#Statement-non-opinion
And he did, uh, mention Beginning Experience Weekends as one of the, you know, one of the places.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I've ha-, um,#Uninterpretable
That's interesting.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it, it really was.#Agree/Accept
A real fun boo-, bunch of books that I read, uh, the beginning of last year were, um, the author of JONATHAN, JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEA-, SEAGULL#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can't think of his name.#Statement-non-opinion
Is it ?#Yes-No-Question
Pardon me#Signal-non-understanding
?#Yes-No-Question
uh, no, uh, oh,#No answers
it'll, it'll come to me,#Statement-non-opinion
but he wrote, he wrote the ILLUSION, and A BRIDGE OVER TI-, A BRIDGE TO FOREVER.#Statement-non-opinion
Those are mind expanding books#Statement-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
His concepts are so different than what I would have ever dreamed of.#Statement-non-opinion
I can't think of what his name is right, right off the bat, though.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, they, they were fun.#Statement-non-opinion
They were real just books for fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Have you been involved on the Switchboard long?#Yes-No-Question
Um, not very long.#Negative non-no answers
I really just started.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How did you get involved?#Wh-Question
My wife has been working for T I.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Response Acknowledgement
I'm a former T I-er.#Statement-non-opinion
I just recently quit.#Statement-non-opinion
And so, uh, I got myself involved in a sales job,#Statement-non-opinion
and right now, my list of books to be read have to do with, uh, the art of selling.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
It's just, I was just thinking, at, at Rossa#Statement-non-opinion
they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just to help us deal with all the things that we have to deal with.#Other
So, I keep getting stacks of books I need to read,#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Never,#Statement-opinion
never#Statement-opinion
I don't know when I'm going to get to them all.#Other
there's never going to be enough hours in the day.#Statement-opinion
I don't think so.#Agree/Accept
Even if you took speed reading. Huh.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I don't think so.#Agree/Accept
So, well, I'm trying to think of what other kind.#Hold before answer/agreement
Do you like to read mysteries.#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
a little bit.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you like Ken ?#Yes-No-Question
Um. Trying to think.#Hold before answer/agreement
He writes, uh, spy novels, THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I've, I've really, I really have found his books enjoyable#Statement-non-opinion
I like that kind of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
I think the last novel I read I read, I guess, in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year.#Statement-non-opinion
It was a, um, last name's ,#Statement-non-opinion
it's called PIERCING, no, it's called THIS PRESENT DARKNESS.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, uh, kind of unusual book.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh that sounds interesting.#Appreciation
It sounds really good.#Statement-opinion
Hey, you should make yourself a promise that you'll, you'll read one novel in the next six months, just for you.#Action-directive
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
You know, it's, it's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work, or, you know, self improvement,#Statement-opinion
and you kind of forget the fun of reading#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
very easily.#Statement-opinion
So#Uninterpretable
Well, I guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly.#Statement-opinion
I think so, too.#Agree/Accept
And I thank you for calling.#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
nice talking to you, Linda.#Conventional-closing

Well, um, since I'm in college, uh, I mean, uh, I haven't seen that much change#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I'm kind of young still,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know how much it changed in the last, uh, twenty years anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
But, I don't know.#Hedge
Do you, do you have an idea of, of how much.#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I'm not that old either#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm only twenty-nine.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
So, social changes aren't that much for me either.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I can remember are from, from my childhood were the disco days#Statement-non-opinion
and maybe that's changed a lot. Uh#Statement-opinion
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that.#Uninterpretable
the way, the way people dress#Other
and, uh.#Uninterpretable
I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.#Statement-opinion
More lax?#Signal-non-understanding
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
relaxed#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and laid back and stuff#Other
and.#Uninterpretable
Maybe a people are a little o-, more open-minded than maybe they used to be.#Statement-opinion
I think so.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think so,#Statement-non-opinion
and a lot,#Statement-non-opinion
I think people are, are used to now saying what's, what's on their minds more#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
more up front#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than they used to be.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like, you know, Pro-Life and, and Pro-, uh, Choice in, in the special interest groups maybe#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, like amnesty.#Other
Uh, yeah,#Uninterpretable
maybe people are a little, a little more, uh, free to express their opinions, socially free.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think so.#Statement-non-opinion
I think women have come out more#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
too, on, on like child abuse#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and the wife beatings,#Other
and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and like you said, pro cho-, pro-choice and#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whatnot.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's become more out-, outstanding than it used to be where women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Just wasn't socially acceptable.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
huh-uh.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, maybe, maybe too a big social change that's, that's maybe for the worst is, uh, is, is how, um, the people's, uh, views on, on relationships has changed, you know,#Statement-opinion
and now we have, now we have several, you know, we have to worry about AIDS#Statement-opinion
and we have to worry about, uh, maybe people are becoming more aware, more, more afraid of#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
relationships.#Other
Well, I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and all that stuff,#Other
and, you know, we didn't have to talk about,#Statement-non-opinion
well basically her thing was just don't do it, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Ri-,#Uninterpretable
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, I'm not, I'm not naive,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to think that my children are not going to not do it.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It wasn't that long that I was that young.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I've got a ten year old,#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, he thought, he knows about condoms,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he knows about AIDS,#Other
and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's just different things you have to talk to them about now#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
It used to be that we were, th-, that we were trying to protect morality.#Statement-opinion
Now it's we're protecting our lives.#Statement-opinion
It's a#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's a much different,#Other
we have, you know,#Uninterpretable
you can't just, just hope for abstinence.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
I don't, I think that's stupidity on parents' part.#Statement-opinion
I mean#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's, sex is rampant,#Other
and it always will be,#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I think, too, noticing the kids, that the fourth and fifth graders, which is what my son is#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and stuff, they, they're just, they're more, they're very open.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, the boys are very open#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because that's, that's all I have is boys, so that's all I'm around#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
basically, is boys,#Other
but they talk about things that I, my brother didn't talk about until he was in college#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
and, and they sit down#Statement-non-opinion
and they look at you right in the face#Statement-non-opinion
and they expect a truthful answer.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
You can't get them, give them, the, oh, you know, Cabbage Patch answers#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and stuff.#Other
They, they,#Uninterpretable
that just does not go.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they can tell me, basically some things that I don't know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it, it's interesting, listening to them.#Statement-non-opinion
I think, I think the social changes in them, I think I see it more with that generation#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than I do with like our generation.#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
I, I, I imagine you're right.#Statement-opinion
I, I teach swim lessons a lot,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and to see what, see what kids talk about when, uh, you know, they're, they're open about, well, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
kids are a lot more educated now than I think that, that, like we were, uh, at that age#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I do too.#Statement-non-opinion
um, about a lot of things.#Other
You know, besides what, besides what they learn, uh, from, from our social environment is, uh, their education is just amazing.#Statement-opinion
Kids are, kids are learning, uh, you know,#Statement-opinion
their math is just,#Statement-non-opinion
every year, uh, algebra goes down a grade, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, uh, students learn it earlier.#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Statement-non-opinion
well, my son, the, my fourth grader, he is,#Statement-non-opinion

Well, Stephanie, what's your position on gun control?#Open-Question
Well, on a scale of one to ten, uh, being ten, no, kind of legislation and zero being, uh, total ban, I probably would lean more towards six or seven.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I lived in Massachusetts for two years#Statement-non-opinion
and they have a total ban on guns#Statement-non-opinion
and I saw that, it didn't stop crime in that state.#Statement-non-opinion
Now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles?#Or-Clause
Any, any kind of firearms.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
Uh, it's,#Uninterpretable
there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught, um, with a firearm#Statement-non-opinion
and also I think there was a fine.#Statement-non-opinion
And that didn't help at all?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I don't,#Uninterpretable
the, the crime is not any better or any worse,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it's,#Uninterpretable
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I shouldn't say I don't know if it was any worse,#Statement-non-opinion
but it certainly didn't get any better.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I usually just,#Uninterpretable
I'm trying to think of,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess I would tend myself to be more towards the, the, like three,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where I don't think you should necessarily ban guns any, by any means,#Other
but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature, uh,#Statement-opinion
you know, you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one and, you know, right off the shelf.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I, I agree with that.#Statement-non-opinion
And but,#Uninterpretable
I, I think that the, the law is on who can buy a gun are, are way too lax.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
exactly.#Agree/Accept
I think that, I think that the,#Uninterpretable
And, so, I think that kind of control is, would be good,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but the, uh,#Uninterpretable
I, you know, I'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement and, just to kind of exam it a little bit#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true, uh,#Statement-opinion
only the guns were in the hands of the criminals,#Statement-opinion
but how many times,#Uninterpretable
I guess I have never heard of a, a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun.#Statement-opinion
Um, I,#Uninterpretable
And maybe they just don't report those#Statement-opinion
or I'm not sure#Hedge
or, you know, I can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed#Statement-opinion
but good thing they had their gun on them#Statement-opinion
and they, they thwarted the robbery attempt.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I'm, I'm not really sure,#Hedge
I don't, personally I don't own a gun,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, and I don't think I probably ever would, um, although I would like to know how to handle one,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it's good that everyb-, and I think everybody should learn how to handle one.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, you just never know when you might come into contact with one.#Statement-non-opinion
True.#Appreciation
Um,#Uninterpretable
Did, did you, were you brought up in a family that hunted#Declarative Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
No.#No answers
Uh, nobody in my family hunted,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, my father had, had guns when I was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in Massachusetts#Statement-non-opinion
We lived in New Hampshire at the time.#Statement-non-opinion
How about that.#Appreciation
And he lived in Massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so we ended up, uh, with these guns,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my, really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right#Statement-non-opinion
and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, jeez.#Appreciation
And so that was really the only experience that I've had with guns#Statement-non-opinion
and it,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it kind of scared me.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I think that if I learn how to use one, I would, I would feel better.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've also always thought about the idea, you know, most sports, you know, which are the N R A and people have their thing, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
if you ban guns, you're just banning the, the recreation, the sport of hunting, things of that nature.#Statement-non-opinion
Most of that's done with rifles and such. Uh, though there's, you know, probably I'm sure some sector that does it with handguns.#Statement-non-opinion
But just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns, would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous,#Statement-non-opinion
you couldn't be inconspicuous,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when you walked into a store stuff like that,#Other
you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
you-, if they had to have a rifle or was,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, made it more difficult to get a, a, uh, a handgun.#Statement-non-opinion
Now of course, you know, in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Appreciation
But I guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and, you know, temporarily a little bit, uh, offset or off keel,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if that's a large percentage of, uh, crime or not#Hedge
but I guess it would be some.#Statement-non-opinion
But I, I think definitely,#Statement-opinion
like today they just introduced the, what's called the Brady bill. The seven day mandatory waiting period,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on getting any guns.#Other
And I think that,#Statement-opinion
I would definitely support that.#Statement-opinion
Shoot that's a good idea.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I, I, I agree the thing that scares me, uh, though about where I would, I would wa-, definitely want some sort of legislation#Statement-non-opinion
and coming from the north east, I'm just not used to seeing, um, these,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I know this may sound kind of stereo typical#Statement-non-opinion
but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, sure.#Appreciation
That's kind of scary to me#Other
that kind of, to me it is more like vigilantism .#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in L A, on the freeways,#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's crazy .#Appreciation
and then you come here in, in the Dallas area, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't, I don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's kind of, kind of wild.#Statement-opinion
Um, especially not in the back window,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for everybody to see.#Other
That is kind of wild.#Appreciation
Well, that's all very interesting#Statement-opinion
Well, thanks for talking.#Conventional-closing
Sure you're welcome.#Conventional-closing
Good-bye.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay, uh,#Other
why do you think it, uh, sounds,#Open-Question
do you think we should adopt it?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I don't like metric system.#Statement-non-opinion
You don't?#Yes-No-Question
I, I, I think the country is, is, uh, too ingrained in the inches and, and just the general, uh, background,#Statement-opinion
the history of our country has been inches#Statement-opinion
and I don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It, it's going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years#Statement-opinion
and there are going to be people who die because of it because they don't understand, uh, you know, simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you know how far away something is#Other
and it's, it's not in our national consciousness to do it.#Statement-opinion
We've always measured things in the English system#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, everything, you know,#Other
our land is in acres,#Statement-non-opinion
our people aren't going to understand what#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
an amount of something is.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I agree with you.#Agree/Accept
I don't think we should either even though I know there are benefits to the metric system,#Statement-opinion
I don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the, the disadvantages that would happen to the people in America#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and also the, uh,#Uninterpretable
I don't know#Hedge
it seems almost like there's this, it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we'll look good to the other nations#Statement-opinion
because I think they, that's an area that the other nations, especially Europe, look down on us like oh, we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system, who haven't really attained it yet.#Statement-opinion
And I feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us.#Statement-opinion
And it's like, hey, we're content with this#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
it's probably not as accurate,#Statement-opinion
probably, you know, intellectually doesn't,#Statement-opinion
it's not as sound intellectually, but, like you said I mean, come on.#Statement-opinion
I had six years of college#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't know the metric system and I don't care to learn it#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I'm not some kind of an idiot,#Statement-opinion
I just,#Uninterpretable
And it's easy to trans-,#Statement-opinion
we have a computer for just about everything now#Statement-opinion
and if it's necessary to translate back and forth between them, it can be done#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I'm a mechanical engineer#Statement-non-opinion
and I've had to work when I was designing packages for people,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean I had to, to work both systems#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
back and forth#Other
and it was not hard#Statement-non-opinion
and you get, you can get a CAT CAM system that can take any design you want#Statement-non-opinion
and you can push a button#Statement-non-opinion
and it'll convert every measurement on there#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, from one system to the other#Other
There's a lot of#Statement-non-opinion
in seconds.#Other
people,#Other
like you're educated,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm educated,#Statement-non-opinion
my husband is,#Statement-non-opinion
but, I mean, a lot of people are flat not educated#Statement-non-opinion
and if I have a hard time, you know#Statement-opinion
Really.#Agree/Accept
putting that into my life, can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college#Other
or I don't know how much of the#Hedge
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
they don't have any college probably much at all#Other
and if we can't take it and use it easily, well, how can you put that on, like, elderly people and#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's just,#Uninterpretable
you know, just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as, as much sharpness and ment-, mental acuity,#Other
Or, or even have had the ability, you know, the chance to, to go to college or to, to#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to learn about,#Other
I think it's still good they do cover the system.#Statement-opinion
I think it should still be taught in schools.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they do,#Statement-non-opinion
I know now because I,#Statement-non-opinion
even when I was in elementary school years ago#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they were, you know, we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and the various, you know#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
basically the other alternate forms of measurements, things like that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and that's acceptable.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think it failed, too,#Statement-opinion
because like what you said of just, you know, hey this is ridiculous.#Statement-opinion
The thing Americans have so much stress on them right now.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean if you look at the average family it's, like, man, they barely have time to stop and get gas, much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and#Statement-opinion
Really#Agree/Accept
do all this.#Other
It's like, I mean come on let's take the pressure,#Statement-opinion
You know you need twenty gallons, but do you need how many liters#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's just like another thing#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the American family doesn't need any more pressure.#Statement-opinion
Just leave them alone,#Statement-opinion
let them measure their drinking water in cups#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
leave them alone#Other
And it, it just doesn't, it just doesn't make that much difference in the average life#Statement-opinion
and the scientific community and places where it's needed#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, that's fine#Other
and the rest of the world, I mean, we are,#Statement-opinion
it's not,#Uninterpretable
we may not be the top,#Statement-opinion
I don't know if we're the top,#Statement-non-opinion
we're one of the top superpowers of the world.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's,#Uninterpretable
It may be arrogant,#Statement-non-opinion
but I mean, let them come to us#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
That's kind of the way I feel about it.#Statement-non-opinion
We can convert,#Statement-opinion
And, and if they don't like the way we do it just get off our, don't worry about it. And I think,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, it's kind of like expecting everyone to suddenly speak German.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
it is#Uninterpretable
You know.#Other
because it is another language,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and, instead of saying the world speak German we found out that we can translate#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And that's what I think we ought to do with the metric system.#Statement-opinion
That's funny.#Appreciation
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
I think we kept it at real good.#Statement-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Is that all we need to say?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
It's been nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
You, too.#Conventional-closing
I think that was good.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
That was the best one.#Conventional-closing
Usually I get distracted off the topic.#Conventional-closing
You know what I mean.#Conventional-closing
Yeah.#Conventional-closing
And we'll end up, one man was telling me about his grandfather in Lithuania,#Conventional-closing
and we were talking about something tot-, income tax or something.#Conventional-closing
All right.#Conventional-closing
And I just,#Conventional-closing
Well, good talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Anyway, I appreciate it.#Conventional-closing
Have a good day.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

There you go.#Other
First question,#Statement-non-opinion
do you own your house?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, right,#Affirmative non-yes answers
well, we try.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it's a big mortgage in the sky#Statement-non-opinion
and someday, maybe, we might even own it,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, for all practical purposes, I guess we hold the mortgage#Statement-non-opinion
Our name is on the till,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that implies ownership.#Statement-non-opinion
No one else has offered to pay for it.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
I would not object if anybody did.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
really they could move right into the spare room#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, we have, we have had this one for five years now.#Statement-non-opinion
Before that we lived in Garland, uh, probably about, you know, four blocks away.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Liked the area, chose to stay inside of Spring Park.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a, uh,#Uninterpretable
I don't know if you have been up here,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
but it is a residential homeowners,#Statement-non-opinion

association.#Other
So, there's a lot of, you know, activities, a lot of pluses and common land.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it could not possibly have gone any lower#Statement-non-opinion
and so we were wrong#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, five years ago.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think,#Uninterpretable
what,#Uninterpretable
it bottom out about a ye-, year later.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, well,#Uninterpretable
I mean just recently, I would say, I would give it two years back, when it was, I think, bottomed out.#Statement-opinion
Oddly enough, two years, you know,#Agree/Accept
I, uh, I think that,#Uninterpretable
But, maybe not in your area,#Statement-opinion
see, it was just different areas,#Statement-non-opinion
not in, in, uh, this area.#Statement-non-opinion
Cause this is about like the,#Uninterpretable
That's a really nice area.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Besides, it's, you know, it's not, it's not Richardson. Is it?#Yes-No-Question
It's still considered Garland.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
it's, it's Richardson.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, ok,#Response Acknowledgement
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, Richardson#Statement-non-opinion
and, hold on a second.#Action-directive
Paul, I can hear you perfectly, perfectly well,#3rd-party-talk
I don't want to hear you.#3rd-party-talk
You are being rude.#3rd-party-talk
Whatever you ask or scream when I'm on the phone, the answer is no.#3rd-party-talk
Do you understand?#3rd-party-talk
How does that sound?#Wh-Question
There you go.#Appreciation
Write that one down.#Action-directive
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there I go.#Other
It sounded good to me#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I hate to say how long that will last too.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Hold before answer/agreement
this area up here is, uh, all custom homes,#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's,#Other
I don't think that many by the builder that built this house.#Statement-non-opinion
And, we were not the first people, the first owners,#Statement-non-opinion
I think we are the third owners.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was built by the architect for himself, who never moved into it. Who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
Oh, yeah,#Appreciation
caulking windows was a great mystery to them.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gee.#Appreciation
So, they just watched the water pour in on the carpet.#Statement-non-opinion
But, it's a Sharif Myneer Homes, if that means anything,#Statement-non-opinion
it did not really mean anything to me except,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I,#Statement-non-opinion
I liked it.#Other
kept thinking of Omar Sharif every time I saw that name somewhere,#Other
so,#Uninterpretable
He builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now.#Statement-non-opinion
I think he got out of the lower end market.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And decided,#Other
but, the houses here in, in this class of housing never dropped below two hundred.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well but, still I know that this one was built for two ninety nine, which is nowhere near what we paid for it.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot, heavily wooded off the golf course.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, great.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the guy around the corner is being transferred#Statement-non-opinion
so he said, uh, well, he did comparables that it's about eighty dollars,#Statement-non-opinion
let's see what,#Hold before answer/agreement
I don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot#Statement-non-opinion
Well#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
off the creek and eighty on the creek,#Other
Yeah.#Other
or, if it was eighty and a hundred.#Other
Probably eighty.#Statement-opinion
I think it was sixty, eighty.#Reject
Sixty, eighty.#Repeat-phrase
I think.#Hedge
Well because, I know our, our little house over here stuck in the middle of, you know, the subdivision is, I think fifty five,#Statement-non-opinion
so, I think the high end is definitely, you know somewhere there#Statement-opinion
Well, try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot#Action-directive
No,#Reject
it could not be,#Statement-opinion
because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet,#Statement-non-opinion
and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just never.#Statement-opinion
Well#Uninterpretable
Now, maybe, you know, that's pretty close to what it would have sold for, uh, brand new,#Statement-opinion
or that's pretty much what it was built for.#Statement-opinion
It's got an awful lot of nice things in it#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, I don't think, I think it's going to be a long time, if ever, when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really, uh, desirable.#Statement-opinion
It's seems like people go for square footage only now#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, cause. Have you been back to the Perry Homes, back here?#Yes-No-Question
Um, the ones that look like brick houses ?#Signal-non-understanding
The one that looks like Monopoly apartments.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Yes answers
I think those are awful.#Statement-opinion
I'm sorry,#Apology
I just don't see the designer's,#Statement-non-opinion
I just see him as trying to squish as much space, you know, as much house into the space as possible.#Statement-non-opinion
They are huge when you are inside them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They are very spacious.#Statement-non-opinion
They are, you know,#Uninterpretable
I was, I was in one today.#Statement-non-opinion
It was forty two hundred square feet.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well see that's,#Uninterpretable
the house that we got is small enough so my husband and I,#Statement-non-opinion
because there's just the two of us#Statement-non-opinion
and the two cats, um, can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard.#Statement-non-opinion
And we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know.#Statement-non-opinion
See, when you have kids, you like to be able to,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them.#Other
But, I have been watching these houses go up#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I don't, well,#Uninterpretable
somebody was telling me,#Statement-non-opinion
I know somebody who lives back there,#Statement-non-opinion
I have always questioned the quality of construction#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house.#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
When you watch them go up, you are just amazed that they do not fall over.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it takes them something like, thirty days to complete a house.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's amazing.#Appreciation
Right now, in fact, even as we speak, we are having a deck put on in back,#Statement-non-opinion
and these guys are phenomenal.#Statement-non-opinion
They just, they, they are doing such a terrific job back there,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you know, you pay for it too,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's, it's like, really worth it.#Statement-non-opinion
They are putting in a deck,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a redwood deck,#Other
and it's just, they are doing such a fine, fine job.#Statement-non-opinion
We have got#Statement-non-opinion
I'm really excited about it,#Statement-non-opinion
three different levels of decking, because,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this lot slopes way back down#Other
and, uh, the house is built around the trees.#Statement-non-opinion
Great.#Appreciation
And with these decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up#Statement-non-opinion
so, it's real, real shady.#Statement-non-opinion
But, that's one of the few things that really, uh, immediately pays back on return.#Statement-non-opinion
But, what I was going to tell you, these Perry Homes back there,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when the people from M C I come down#Statement-non-opinion
and they are, you know, they are used to the Virginia area, metropolitan D C.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My God, they come down here and those houses, that, that look the colonial look what the,#Statement-non-opinion
Looks like the George Town brownstone#Summarize/reformulate
Right,#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it, for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars,#Statement-opinion
Must be a dream.#Collaborative Completion
which is probably about what their equity is, that they got out of selling their house.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because those things are selling like hot cakes.#Statement-non-opinion
But, one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill, per month, last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a month.#Other
And I thought,#Uninterpretable
I can't ,#Appreciation
and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here.#Statement-non-opinion
And I was thinking, well, you know, I know why your God damn bill is so high,#Statement-non-opinion
He has no insulation, probably.#Statement-opinion
it's because there's not a there's no insulation, insulation in those things.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Gosh.#Appreciation
What a trap. Huh.#Backchannel in question form
Any yet, you know,#Uninterpretable
they, they show very well un-, they show very well unless you have, you know, lived in a lot of houses around the area,#Statement-non-opinion
And you ask the right questions and can research,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or looked at a lot of houses around here.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think that makes a big difference.#Statement-opinion
But, I like, I like this area#Statement-non-opinion
and everything that I have been saying,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I do too.#Statement-non-opinion
says that it's,#Other
I think if we had to sell now, we could come close to breaking even#Statement-opinion
But, still, um, it's worth it for the area and for the school and things like that#Statement-opinion
You're in, you're in the,#Uninterpretable

Well I wondered if I was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type#Statement-non-opinion
Have you been talking to males?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
this is, this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female#Statement-opinion
I was afraid we might get into an argument.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Well, uh, I guess uh, there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for, uh, the roles of women#Other
and uh, I guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities, you know,#Other
they may be going to school, or may have elderly parents, or you know all sorts of other things.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore, the women are spreading themselves thinner,#Statement-opinion
Oh, I think so.#Agree/Accept
than before.#Other
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
I, I, I think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sometimes, I think I am going crazy trying to do it#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Do you work outside the home?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Do you have children?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, yes.#Yes answers
They are getting older now,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so they are not quite as much of a responsibility#Statement-non-opinion
but they are still there, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh sure.#Appreciation
they still take time,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and I, you know, I still provide most of the things that go on around the house.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, yeah#Uninterpretable
and for a while I was going to school too,#Statement-non-opinion
and tha-, it was tough.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I uh, I think that while it's a good change for I think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel, you know,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
their expertise may be.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I think sometimes other things suffer and tha-,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it's hard to find a balance there.#Statement-opinion
But in some ways I think we are expected to do it all.#Statement-opinion
You're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's where the problem is really.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have little children, four and one,#Statement-non-opinion
and I decided that it was very important to me to stay home.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and when I, I, I happen to, you know be,#Uninterpretable
I'm very active with, uh, people, other people with children my age#Statement-non-opinion
and most of us do tend to stay home,#Statement-opinion
but when I run into people that, you know, just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time, I, there's almost a, uh, friction between us.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
not people that are, you know, necessarily good friends,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Even though that has happened too, uh,#Other
it's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence.#Statement-opinion
You know w-,#Uninterpretable
if you decide to go back to work then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And if you don't then, sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you're just wasting your time ,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at home.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's a tough one.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I've done some of both.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, when my kids were real little, I was at home for a couple of different periods of time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, I think the longest was less than a year,#Statement-non-opinion
but still at least I was able to, to spend, you know, those first months with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I mostly went back to work because I was tired of doing without things.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, the money was the issue.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But, uh, even now, I would, I would like to not have to work in some ways.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It, it's kind of pull and tug,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on the other hand, I can't imagine just being at home, uh, although I have a lot of interests and a lot of things I would like to pursue.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, still, uh, there's, there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having, you know, a job and all that goes with that.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
that, that's definitely true.#Agree/Accept
In fact, I, I work out of my home.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I'm an accountant,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I do taxes and bookkeeping#Statement-non-opinion
and I, uh,#Uninterpretable
it was,#Uninterpretable
it's a way for me to stay home.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I mean, I still, unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, but it, it's worked out for, for my family,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to have my cake and eat it too, kind of thing.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's a good deal.#Appreciation
Where do you think this is going in the future,#Open-Question
I mean, do you think things are going to change,#Yes-No-Question
or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this?#Yes-No-Question
Well, I, I hope that they will change uh,#Other answers
but, but I'm,#Uninterpretable
I just,#Uninterpretable
I know it's going to be a slow change.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I, I feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner.#Statement-opinion
I mean I'm just thinking of my circle of people that I know.#Statement-non-opinion
I know quite a few people who have decided to not have both, both, both, uh, couples, you know, both, uh, of the parents work.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And yet, uh, I, I we-,#Uninterpretable
I hope to see employer based, you know, helping out.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, child, uh, care centers at the place of employment and, and things like that, that will help out.#Other
What do you think,#Open-Question
do you think we are,#Yes-No-Question
I don't,#Statement-non-opinion
setting a trend?#Other
yeah,#Yes answers
I, well I see, I think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the, the family things work.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but I don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers, you know.#Statement-opinion
It's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are,#Statement-opinion
I don't know if they want to completely give that up.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
it's a very personal thing.#Statement-opinion
But, it would be nice if there could be an in-between, a middle ground somewhere.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it's hard though when you talk about, about families and, and raising children#Statement-non-opinion
because ch-, I think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground.#Statement-opinion
I think they, uh, they need security#Statement-opinion
and yet they,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
I,#Uninterpretable
from speaking from my children, the-, they aren't real flexible when it comes to things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They, uh, they want to know things are going to be a certain way.#Statement-opinion
Well, yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think they, they like a routine of sorts.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Agree/Accept
Well, we will see.#Hedge
I, I'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, yes,#Agree/Accept
I, I like the fact that, you know, gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's still a long way from being what it ought to be.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yes,#Agree/Accept
the, the numbers are still very skewed to say the least.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay,#Uninterpretable
well I enjoyed talking to you.#Conventional-closing

So, what kind of music you into?#Wh-Question
Well, I have a, uh, pretty wide taste, uh, in music, ranging from progressive rock to jazz to, uh, lot of different forms of, uh, music.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, it's easier for me to say, uh, the types of music that I don't like are opera and, uh, screaming heavy metal.#Statement-non-opinion
The opera, yeah, it's right on track.#Agree/Accept
I like classical,#Statement-non-opinion
but I can't deal with opera at all.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And heavy metal, uh, it's noisy.#Statement-opinion
I'm into, uh, some industrial music that's, a, a bit even harder than that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it's, it's got to have a point to it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but, uh, the, the, uh, basic point of heavy metal w-, which seems to be music to annoy you,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
is, uh, gets a little annoying.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
What kind of progressive stuff?#Wh-Question
Uh, lot of stuff that actually has, uh, ended up becoming popular like, uh, Nirvana and, uh, oh, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm thirty,#Statement-non-opinion
so lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and, and the Sex Pistols and#Statement-non-opinion
uh.#Uninterpretable
R E M, that sort of stuff.#Other
Uh, R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being, uh, you know, ultra mainstream at this point,#Statement-opinion
and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's, a lot of people l-, like, saying that, you know, bands in that position, you know, sold out.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's pretty much, you know, bull.#Statement-opinion
Because R E M really hasn't changed.#Statement-opinion
If, it's, it's interesting.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
They're producing, uh, similar music#Statement-opinion
and it's good music#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, you know, people have picked up on it.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
That's good.#Statement-opinion
I think it is.#Agree/Accept
I'm impressed.#Statement-opinion
Uh, for a while there, music seemed to really ha-, popular music seemed to have, uh, not a lot of point to it.#Statement-opinion
I was really tired of, uh, the Michael Bolton.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Mi-, Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I could, uh, go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money.#Statement-opinion
Uh, but he picked the right songs#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
I guess.#Agree/Accept
and that that's about all he had going for him. Or still has, for that matter.#Other
That, and a marvelous hairdo.#Collaborative Completion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I'm sure that, that so-, that sold a lot for him.#Statement-opinion
That's all you really need for a lot of, lot of pop.#Statement-opinion
I'm ki-, I've kind of like developed a, a short hatred for, for pop.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
It just seems like there's no, no real point.#Statement-opinion
You hear the same, same tune over and over again#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in a thousand guises#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Well, i-, it's interesting because you were, you were saying that you liked classical music#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I like a lot of classical music,#Statement-non-opinion
but I also dislike, uh, some classical music,#Statement-non-opinion
and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and feel that if, if it's not seventy five years old, it hasn't stood the test of time.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can, I can believe that.#Statement-opinion
What kind of things are you, do you like in classical?#Wh-Question
What's the#Open-Question

Stuff that I like,#Hold before answer/agreement

I tolerate Vivaldi.#Statement-non-opinion
I can't,#Statement-non-opinion

stand, uh, uh, Debussy or Debussy#Other

Uh, uh, I like Tchaikovsky.#Statement-non-opinion
He can make a lot of noise when he's, uh, so inclined.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
Uh, and some of, some stuff that I like, uh,#Hedge
for instance, Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's interesting music,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but it would not get performed by any, uh, municipally funded, uh, philharmonic,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
uh, just because, number one, it's Frank Zappa and he's weird, number two, isn't he still alive.#Other
You know, we're, we're,#Quotation

much better off playing, uh, Beethoven's ninth,#Other
that's right, you know,#Quotation
w-, we'll do, we'll do the ninth#Quotation
and everyone will know it and#Quotation
It's safe.#Collaborative Completion
and hum it#Other
and i-, it, it just isn't chance taking enough for me.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Uh, I feel that, uh, that, that music should take chances in one way or another and that, uh, you know, if you've heard a piece, oh, a hundred, a hundred times,#Statement-opinion

Okay,#Other
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?#Wh-Question
Uh, not too bad really.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just, I really didn't want it,#Statement-non-opinion
but I got it anyway#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it was a Braun#Statement-non-opinion
and they were real good about taking it back.#Statement-non-opinion
It wasn't a problem at all,#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh, I was able to get that back pretty easily.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
I really haven't returned a whole lot lately.#Statement-non-opinion

and say, well, I should have known better,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I bought it from G I Joe's#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it was probably made in China by slaves.#Statement-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, they, uh,#Uninterpretable
most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that, uh, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized#Statement-opinion

like,#Uninterpretable
and if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find.#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
It's probably#Statement-opinion
I was reading,#Uninterpretable
a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
I was reading something in, uh, CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact.#Statement-non-opinion
They were talking about cars, uh, the car issue just came out.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And about how, yeah, you'd like to buy an American car maybe#Other
but, uh, you know, the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, like I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger#Statement-non-opinion
and, and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, so it's like, what are you going to do, you know?#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
really.#Agree/Accept
But, uh, that's the way it is.#Statement-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
I, I personally feel that, uh, uh, if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them, you know, that's the way it goes#Statement-opinion
and, you know, people, man-, more than manufacturers should get a clue#Statement-opinion
and, you know, they should start making quality products.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think they're beginning to.#Statement-opinion
The, the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
That's what I thought, too, until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, they've got all the American, well, all the, all the cars rated, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, essentially, I h-, I don't see much of a trend.#Statement-opinion
I mean, just like every other time that you look at it, the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there.#Statement-opinion
There's nothing wrong with them. Uh, and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars.#Statement-opinion
But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy#Statement-opinion
and they're pieces of junk.#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
Still at it, hey.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's ninety, that's eighty-six through ninety-one.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
But, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
may-, maybe they're getting better,#Statement-opinion
maybe they're starting to get a clue. Uh,#Statement-opinion
Well, they got a three year lead time.#Statement-non-opinion
It probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's just it.#Agree/Accept
Technology that comes in right now is, is probably not going to be imple-, implemented until, you know, quite a few years down the road.#Statement-opinion
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
because technology is so, uh, you know, volatile and changing all the time.#Statement-opinion
And can you#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
think of any other industry where in software they,#Other
if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out, you'll get a free version in the mail s-, .#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or, uh, maybe I say, well, you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program, so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

uh, th-, they keep up c-, with it pretty quickly#Statement-opinion
and that's, that's a real good thing, I guess.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I don't know.#Hedge
And the hardware, well, I mean, all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity#Statement-opinion

they're kind of the leaders right now, you know.#Statement-opinion

Really,#Agree/Accept
why don't they just say, almost a Mac for half the price.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah, you know.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They'd sell more if they were honest.#Statement-opinion
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
almost is the key word, there, too, you know, because I, I really, I've used both#Statement-opinion

it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S.#Other

But, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
I'm really, I've gotten a little bit out of the, the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I do use a Mac at work#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I really don't, don't do much with it at home#Other
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
Apple's sort of making a s-,#Statement-opinion
and they're ones were#Statement-opinion
growling consumer, uh, need to worry about the Mac they're getting,#Statement-opinion

and I, I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah?#Backchannel in question form
All right.#Uninterpretable
But, uh, technically, I'm not actually in the industry.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't work a computer company.#Statement-non-opinion
No?#Backchannel in question form
I'm an abuser.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's, that's all right.#Appreciation
But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to#Statement-opinion

that's true.#Agree/Accept
you know, keep up with the changes as they happen.#Other
Something that I find uncomfortable is, you know, you, you want to buy something, say you want to buy a personal computer#Statement-opinion
and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for, you know,#Statement-opinion
let, let's take the example, the modem for, you know,#Statement-non-opinion

I don't either.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I mean it's,#Uninterpretable
you know it,#Uninterpretable
I don't think it's going to change very much#Statement-opinion

No,#Agree/Accept
I agree with that. As, as far as the, as far as the mess that's developing as a result, um, you know,#Agree/Accept
as a country, the United States, uh,#Statement-opinion
I think our hands are tied#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as far as, as, as any further involvement,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
until the U N sanctions it.#Other
In fact, it really was to begin with.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I just, I heard a comment on the radio this morning that, uh, you know, it, it gets to a point where, uh, if enough people are, are going to be slaughtered over there over the, the, the internal problems, um, somebody may step in again.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I really think it's, it's a U N issue,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at that point because it is internal.#Other
Well, you know the funny thing I find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before, the American public goes crazy.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in, in Iraq, they're going crazy.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's right .#Agree/Accept
You know, I mean you can't please them one way or the other.#Statement-opinion
Absolutely right.#Agree/Accept
You know, and I, and I think that, I, I agree with you,#Agree/Accept
this is exactly the right course.#Statement-opinion
I mean that's an internal problem to Iraq.#Statement-opinion
It has nothing to do with us.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And until he starts doing something so inhumane that the U N gets involved, then it's nobody's business.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Um,#Uninterpretable
I mean these, these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time.#Statement-opinion
All the time.#Agree/Accept
I mean, yeah,#Agree/Accept
I mean,#Uninterpretable
Some of them have been going on for, for tens of years,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if, if I understand it right in places like the Sudan and,#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and it's certainly, and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's going to continue.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
As long as you have so many diverse groups that are, that are vying for power, it's going to happen all the time.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's absolutely right.#Agree/Accept
I mean the Kurds have tried it before.#Statement-opinion
They've gotten their butts kicked,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and this is just another time that it's happening.#Statement-opinion
That's, that's absolutely right.#Agree/Accept
You know, they'll regroup out in the mountains#Statement-opinion
and they'll try it again in a couple of years.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it was just, you know, it was,#Uninterpretable
it's a very opportune moment for them to try.#Statement-opinion
You know you,#Uninterpretable
Sure,#Agree/Accept
and, and, and I don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I'm not real sure that we promised them anything.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
that would have been stupid,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and I don't think we did it.#Statement-opinion
Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right.#Statement-opinion
I don't think they would have done that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree.#Agree/Accept
But it just, it, it really doesn't make any difference.#Statement-opinion
This is just a, a, another chapter in Middle Eastern history.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and, you know, and it, there are many of them.#Statement-opinion
There's no doubt about it.#Statement-opinion
Oh, sure,#Agree/Accept
I mean the, the British occupied the place,#Statement-non-opinion
the French occupied it,#Statement-non-opinion
we've done it.#Statement-non-opinion

this is, this is really nothing special. Uh,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Well, and, and, and so many of the, so many of the conflicts, um, really don't have a basis in, in, uh, politics or, or human rights or anything like that.#Statement-opinion
It,#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
it's al-, it's mostly religious anyway.#Collaborative Completion
It's, it's religious based#Other
and, uh, you know, by, by self-proclamation this is a holy war#Statement-opinion
and it is right.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then, uh, we, we go on from there#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable

exactly.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, it's, it's a mess.#Statement-opinion
It, it's,#Uninterpretable
there's no doubt about it,#Statement-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, I, I, I think one of the big problems,#Statement-opinion
I mean looking at it from the Am-, the American public's standpoints, they don't understand the Middle Easterners.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
They don't understand what,#Statement-opinion
I mean their politics really isn't politics.#Statement-opinion
It's religion couched as politics.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
And there's a big difference.#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
You know, uh, we sit there#Statement-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's a big mistake,#Statement-opinion
You bet.#Appreciation
because they don't.#Other
You bet.#Appreciation

because there's no, uh, you know, there's, there's, there's a complete different set of values.#Statement-opinion

Um, there's, there's different value placed on human life,#Statement-opinion

And, uh, what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases.#Statement-opinion

Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I don't claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
Now I,#Uninterpretable
shoot, I, I think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't, don't have a clue sometimes.#Statement-opinion
That's probably true,#Agree/Accept
that's probably true.#Agree/Accept
You know they, they sit there and, and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I'm not real sure that's, that's appropriate.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
no,#Agree/Accept
that's, that's, uh,#Uninterpretable
a, a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field.#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, I sort,#Uninterpretable
that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country, too.#Statement-non-opinion

It's, it's like our car industry,#Statement-opinion

I had not been able to play#Statement-non-opinion
so I took out a few videos and watched them for a while,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I hope I'm on the right track.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Shot a career low eighty-nine, so, and my handicap is twenty nine.#Statement-non-opinion
That's, that's great.#Appreciation
I like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now it's, uh, like I say, it's been a while for me, too.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh, I've got my wife motivated about it, um#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I think that's probably going to be one of the next investments, is get her, get her a set of clubs#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we'll get out of the driving range and, and get some interest built up#Statement-non-opinion
and hopefully we can, uh, we can start in.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've tried to get my wife,#Statement-non-opinion
I bought her a set of clubs four years ago.#Statement-non-opinion
She hasn't even swung them,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she wants to get into it now after I came home and won the tournament the other day,#Other
she's#Statement-non-opinion
Well, great, great.#Appreciation
That's good,#Appreciation
she's ready to get off into it,#Other
but, you know, I like, I just like getting out, being in the outdoors,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm a hunter and fisher anyway,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
same thing here.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, at least I can get out and play a few hours of golf#Statement-non-opinion
and it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg, really.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I, you know, I walk,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't ride#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, I get a little exercise there, too,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
That's,#Uninterpretable
I've got the same attitude.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh, I tell you,#Hold before answer/agreement
I started,#Uninterpretable
I guess, the first time I played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now, when I was in college.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I took, uh, I took it as a P E course and then kind of left it alone for a while,#Statement-non-opinion
and then finally got, got into it when I was, while I was still in school#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and since then, uh, we've made it, um,#Statement-non-opinion
as, as the friends start getting married and things like that, we've made a tradition of, uh, having a, a Thursday, um,#Statement-non-opinion
well, have, have probably like, like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, so, it,#Uninterpretable
that's back in South Dakota where I grew up#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, so that, that's, uh, that's been my main, my main involvement,#Statement-non-opinion
is it seems like I go home and play golf more than I do around here,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
eventually I get people to come and visit me in Dallas,#Other
and then I'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's pretty nice.#Statement-opinion
We played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not.#Statement-non-opinion
They were amazed.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, here it is, sixty-five degrees,#Statement-non-opinion
we're out playing golf,#Statement-non-opinion
and they're freezing cold back there,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Statement-non-opinion
Yep,#Agree/Accept
yep.#Agree/Accept
But, I, uh, actually I picked it up when I was in high school, on the same as a P E course, you know,#Other
when I got into the service I got into it#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and now when I come out here I just kind of let it go,#Statement-non-opinion
and then one, one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if I played golf.#Statement-non-opinion
And I said, Well, yeah, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I've got my clubs,#Quotation
but I haven't swung them in quite a few years.#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then I got into it and then back out of it,#Statement-non-opinion
and it just seems like every couple of years I get back in there#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
You know, I really enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
It's really nice.#Statement-opinion
Oh, it is, it's, it's a lot of fun, especially if you can find somebody that's, uh, that's got the same level of interest.#Statement-opinion
That seem to be the hardest#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
thing.#Other
Well, about,#Uninterpretable
that's, that's true of any sport, you know.#Statement-opinion
If you want to play tennis, or#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
racquetball,#Other
you don't want to go out and get beat to death,#Statement-opinion
but.#Uninterpretable
Right,#Agree/Accept
and, and people don't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time, you know#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
and, and, uh,#Uninterpretable
And then, you know, we've got some guys here that they are, you know, four and five handicappers#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they don't like to play with me because I'm too slow for them,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, but get somebody around your own handicap, and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time.#Other
That's right,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
And I've, you know, I've#Uninterpretable
never, never yet have I walked up,#Statement-non-opinion
now I've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with,#Statement-non-opinion
and never yet have I met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome.#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
They are always friendly.#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
Sure, come on out, you know,#Quotation
and they don't mind if you make a mistake,#Statement-opinion
they don't mind saying, Well, you know, let me tea-, tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that, or,#Statement-opinion
Well.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, it's, it's pretty nice and friendly out there#Statement-opinion
That, that's, that's so.#Agree/Accept
and you can't find that in all sports.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's absolutely right,#Agree/Accept
and you can gain a lot of ground doing that, too, if you, if, you know,#Statement-opinion
you gets, you get in a rut if you do play a lot#Statement-opinion
but you play with the same people, you, you aren't going to learn anything.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
After a short period, once you learn everything they've got to offer,#Statement-opinion
then#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you need to,#Statement-opinion
you've basically tapped your resources there.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I'd like to, uh, eventually I'd like to work up, if, if my wife does get interested, and maybe get involved in a league in a, in a mixed, mixed doubles league, or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we , we have one down here in the summertime.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or eight o'clock, you know, because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we play in the summertime out here.#Statement-non-opinion
We get a mixed league in,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's what I'm trying to get her ready for.#Statement-non-opinion
It's going to start, well, when we change time back whenever that is#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
next month, I guess,#Other
and it will start then,#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
and they were just starting to learn,#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, they were shooting a hundred, hundred and twenty#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they were, you know,#Uninterpretable
now they're down into the hundreds#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
nineties,#Other
so, it won't take her long.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's good#Appreciation
You know,#Other
that's good, that's sounds like a lot of fun.#Other
And it's something we can do together,#Statement-non-opinion
so. Well, she doesn't do much hunting,#Statement-non-opinion
she could care less about that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
She's does a little fishing,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, golf would give her the exercise,#Statement-opinion
she'd be outside,#Statement-non-opinion
give her something to do that we both enjoy,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, it sounds like we've got real similar situations.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, I go home, uh, I've gone home every year now since I've moved to Dallas to, to go pheasant hunting,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, the, the last time I, I took my wife along#Other
and, uh, k-, kind of the same situation.#Statement-non-opinion
She's, she's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
She'll definitely, uh, she'll make the trip for fishing#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if that comes along,#Other
but, uh#Statement-opinion
All right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, it's interesting,#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and it's, you know, it's a game that you don't,#Statement-opinion
like bowling, you know, you feel bad if you bowl a hundred.#Statement-opinion
But if you shoot a hundred in golf, you know,#Statement-opinion
you don't have to be an expert to play,#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you know, you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
well, yeah,#Agree/Accept
I've, I've kind of formed the attitude that, you know, if I could just, if I could pick two or three shots out, uh, out of my game every time and put them together on one hole, then I do pretty good#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then, and I keep, I keep rationalizing that well, you know, I can do it,#Statement-non-opinion
I just got to do it all at th-, on the same hole,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and then it will get better,#Statement-opinion
and you just keep going,#Statement-opinion
and in the meantime, just enjoy what you're doing.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It, it, it really works that way#Statement-opinion
And when, you know when I first got back into it, I used to get mad because I knew I could do something#Statement-non-opinion
and I didn't get it done.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I just, well, I need to slice this ball around here,#Statement-non-opinion
I naturally slice anyway,#Statement-non-opinion
now you know, the ball will go straight#Statement-opinion
and I go#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I never broke a club or anything,#Other
but, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'd get upset about it sometimes,#Other
and now I guess, you know, being in my forties, I just kind of mellowed out a little bit.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't get upset any more.#Statement-non-opinion
So, and,#Uninterpretable
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And well, that's great.#Appreciation
Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Well, you bet.#Conventional-closing
I guess I'll go back to work.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
sounds like it.#Conventional-closing
All right.#Conventional-closing
See you later .#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay.#Other
Um, do you have any advice for college?#Yes-No-Question
I'm, I'm, I'm full of advice.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm still a graduate student.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Well, having been there not too long ago, and my wife having only recently completed a doctorate,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm fairly full of it, of it myself.#Other
.#Non-verbal
Uh, the main point that I have about choosing where you want to go to school, is that, def-, you have to early on define what it is you want to do#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or at least what area you want to be in.#Other
Uh, I had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized.#Statement-non-opinion
I went through a number of them,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, undergraduate schools, before I found a, a good school that was more general, uh, to give me time to make up my mind.#Other
Oh, that's interesting.#Appreciation
I went to a, a liberal arts school, actually, at first,#Statement-non-opinion
and you weren't really even, um,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
they didn't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were in your second year,#Other
and then you, you know, you had, I think you had to pick it, by, by, by the end of the second you had to pick some sort of major,#Statement-non-opinion
but until then they didn't sort of force you.#Statement-non-opinion
They, they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then. Certain requirements,#Statement-non-opinion
so that, so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything,#Statement-non-opinion
so it wasn't that specialized.#Statement-non-opinion
So that,#Uninterpretable
That's wonderful.#Appreciation
I'm a great co-, proponent of liberal arts education,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for anybody.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, being an engineer now, I believe in it even more strongly than I did before.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was just on a committee recently, actually sponsored by, uh, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, trying to sort of, you know, where, where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together, you know, because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts,#Statement-non-opinion
and then the other way around as well,#Statement-non-opinion
people are getting pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues.#Statement-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Well, thus far it's working to my advantage.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, the great gap historically has, with engineers, has been while they may have all this technical information, they have no way of imparting it to, except to another engineer.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that nonengineers can understand.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that must be helpful.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, it's,#Dispreferred answers
That could be very helpful .#Declarative Yes-No-Question
a lot of fun, at the moment.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I figure that, that, that's probably the thing I would most tell any parent, you know, to tell their kids, I think, probably#Statement-non-opinion
make sure the kid goes to a school where they get sort of a general education#Statement-opinion
and save specialization, I guess, for graduate school, unless they're sure they want, early on they want to do something like engineering or something.#Statement-opinion
Or they can,#Uninterpretable
Even at that, I have a son, that, who's only nine at the moment.#Statement-non-opinion
But I see him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, if he decides to pursue that, I'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college, before I'll even let him go to an engineering college.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, yes,#Agree/Accept
that'll add one year to his education experience.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, but that's a good idea.#Appreciation
Well, where I am right now,#Uninterpretable
actually I'm at the University of Rochester,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's a pretty good engineering school, I think.#Statement-opinion
I think we do some#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Agree/Accept
they have pretty good engineering here.#Other
They also have pre-, a fairly large liberal arts college as well. A sort of, a separate, you know, arts and sciences college.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, and I believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in, in everything,#Statement-non-opinion
and I know people, I do, uh, I do work in language processing,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, and at least one person who's in my field started off as an engineer, started off as an elec-, elec-, an electrical engineer student, and then switched over at some point into language processing, because he found that he enjoyed it more.#Statement-non-opinion
So they do force them,#Statement-non-opinion
people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here, which I think is wonderful.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I agree.#Agree/Accept
Uh, I have the experience, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
the last school that I went to was Mississippi State University#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which is historically an engineering and agricultural school.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, the typical land grant university,#Statement-non-opinion
every state's got one.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Anyway, while it has both engineering and liberal arts, the engineering students tend to cluster together.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, they're in classes together, even when they're outside of the engineering department.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they don't learn the communications,#Statement-non-opinion
they don't learn the thought processes of other fields of, of endeavor.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, you know, it, that's kind of like if I were king for a day, and got to, and got to make one rule.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
My rule would be, no one could get out of high school without an entire year of philosophy.#Other
Um, uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
That would,#Statement-opinion
And it's,#Statement-opinion
be very good actually.#Other
that's not even true in our colleges.#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
you, you don't need any philosophy at all in school.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Uninterpretable
Or so-,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
or, or, or, or some other thought provoking area, you know.#Statement-opinion
Very true.#Agree/Accept
We had, uh, when I went to undergraduate, we had uh,#Statement-non-opinion
went to Brandeis,#Statement-non-opinion
don't know if you know of it or not, uh,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
we had, uh, uh, a requirement freshman year of just Humanities.#Statement-non-opinion
Then you were given a choice of, um, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
there were ten or twelve, or whatever, fift-, or fifteen different courses that you could take,#Statement-non-opinion
but they all centered, they all came out of Philosophy, English, and Literature departments,#Statement-non-opinion
and they were, they were, they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read, you know for,#Statement-non-opinion
so the first year Humanities courses everyone had to read the Iliad an, and so forth,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and what they did do, was they all approached it from, from very different,#Statement-non-opinion
so that you could have one class in the philosophy of something, that the philosophy of Greek mythology or something that actually approached this, or, um, one literature, you know, or a, a literature course or, just all sorts of different perspectives on it,#Statement-non-opinion
and people got to choo-, pick and choose,#Statement-non-opinion
but, but by the end, everyone had a good sample of, of, of, sort of how to think about these things nonscientifically, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, and that sort of forced them.#Statement-non-opinion
But I believe that, that, that you, one of the, one of the best things to do, at least for me in school was, was, I was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses.#Statement-opinion
Um, I was forced to take, I think you know, some sort of art history course,#Statement-non-opinion
and we all grumbled about it at first,#Statement-non-opinion
but then, afterward, we all wound up taking extra art history classes, because it just seemed like something, something we didn't totally know nothing about, but just enjoyed very much doing,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes, I re-,#Statement-non-opinion
and something I would never would have done if, if I wasn't forced to take it.#Other
I remember that experience#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that and, uh, extra music classes.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that, and that really is something that, that I notice,#Statement-non-opinion
like I talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized,#Statement-non-opinion
and they don't have that.#Statement-non-opinion
They just, you know, they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take,#Statement-non-opinion
and that was all.#Statement-non-opinion
They never had some of the more fun classes, I guess .#Statement-non-opinion
I feel a little more worldly now#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
I'm, I'm, I'm hoping, I'm hoping.#Statement-non-opinion
Have, have you gone straight through?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
I, I graduated, um, college in eighty-seven,#Statement-non-opinion
and I just went straight through.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I'm finishing up next year.#Statement-non-opinion
So, yeah,#Yes answers
I didn't take any break or anything yet.#Statement-non-opinion
I've been trying actually, in graduate school, I've been trying to do the same thing, take courses, out-, completely outside my area,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm finding in graduate school it's a lot harder, because, uh, I just don't have the time any more to sort of sit in a course, that I'm not getting graded for.#Statement-non-opinion
Whereas before I would just sign up for credit for it, now I can't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily.#Statement-non-opinion
So I have to try and go myself,#Statement-non-opinion
and I went for like two or three weeks and realized, not enough time for the work unfortunately.#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
Are you pursuing a Master's or a Doctorate?#Or-Clause
I'm pursuing a Doctorate in Psychology.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I'm just, wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, what else.#Hold before answer/agreement
I, I think I,#Uninterpretable
Well, let me, let me encourage you to stop and experience life along the way.#Offers, Options Commits
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty-six.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, six years, and a, and a war later, uh, I got a degree, an undergraduate degree.#Statement-non-opinion
And then fifteen years after that, I got the first of a set of master's degrees#Statement-non-opinion
and four years after that I got another master's degree.#Statement-non-opinion
Um. You had real world experience in the middle there.#Summarize/reformulate
Oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
And that helped, you think?#Yes-No-Question
Or that was,#Uninterpretable
It, it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um. Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm getting some of that.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I have, I have sort of some,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
work experience .#Other
My wife is not an academic at all.#Statement-non-opinion
My wife is sort of in the real world,#Statement-non-opinion
and so I sort of hinge halfway out in the real world#Statement-non-opinion
and I, getting, you know, real world .#Uninterpretable
Especially she works in, uh, uh, she works in the, she works for a temporary agency, ac-,#Statement-non-opinion
and I never would have had,#Uninterpretable
she's the office supervisor,#Statement-non-opinion
I never would have had any, I've, I've learned much just sort of by watching her and her, and her business as well.#Statement-non-opinion
So yeah,#Uninterpretable
so I, I can, I can see where that might be a,#Uninterpretable
Well, vicarious learning is a wonderful thing.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It certainly means that we don't have to experience everything,#Statement-opinion
but experience is a wonderful,#Statement-opinion
That's my,#Uninterpretable
oh yeah.#Agree/Accept
teacher also.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
agreed,#Agree/Accept
agreed.#Agree/Accept
Well, I'll, I'll take that, I'll take that and think that through a little bit. Uh.#Statement-non-opinion
My wife, a-, as I may have mentioned, just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
an-, and she pursued her education along the lines that I did#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with lots of break in between.#Other
And she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now.#Statement-non-opinion
She has an awful lot of experience to draw on.#Statement-non-opinion
No longer#Uninterpretable

Wendy, I guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if, uh, if that may be the case#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that, uh,#Other
let me ask you the question,#Offers, Options Commits
do you have a, uh, budget, or a monthly budget, or a long term budget that you stick to?#Yes-No-Question
Right now I'm in college#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm on work study#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so my budget comes from my dad's help.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He helps me out a lot#Statement-non-opinion
and I get paid monthly,#Statement-non-opinion
so that's kind of hard to have a budget.#Statement-non-opinion
My mother, uh, doesn't get paid much money,#Statement-non-opinion
so her budget is, uh, just, uh, planning for I R A's.#Statement-non-opinion
I see,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, good,#Appreciation
I'm kind of in a different situation,#Statement-non-opinion
but I, I, I went through that, too, when I was in school,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I was, I was working to get through college and, and, uh, trying to make it through that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I'm married and have, uh, a, a couple of children#Other
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we have to, uh, pretty much stick to a budget.#Other
I'm on a salary#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't get any overtime or anything like that#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We have a fixed income#Other
and we have to make sure that, uh, every dollar we have will, is spent accordingly#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, what we try and do to, to stick to our monthly budget is#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we pretty much have, you know, the house payment,#Other
we have the insurance premiums, uh, utilities and so forth#Statement-non-opinion
and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside,#Statement-non-opinion
and we also try and set aside money for savings, set aside money for the coll-, the kids' education#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
college education, the future and, uh, set aside money for bonds#Other
and, and we also set aside an emergency fund#Statement-non-opinion
because#Statement-non-opinion
That sounds good.#Appreciation
we've, uh, we've been married for about ten years#Other
and we find out that, you know, no matter what kind of budget you stick on, there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
happen with the house, that you have to have money for and, uh, not enough to go and to take a loan out, but, uh, you have to have money for.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, then we have, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
whatever's left over is disposable in-, disposable, dis-, yeah, discretionary income,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that we use for the rest of the month,#Other
so, and it's worked out very well.#Statement-opinion
It's, uh, it's helped us, so that we haven't been, you know, too long on the month and too short on the money and#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
uh, try and stick with that#Other
and, nice thing about it, I, my wife is, is excellent in that we both work together,#Statement-non-opinion
we both have a budget,#Statement-non-opinion
and we stick to it#Statement-non-opinion
Well, good.#Appreciation
and there's no surprises in that#Statement-non-opinion
With two kids, that could be hard.#Statement-opinion
Well, actually I have four kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Four!#Appreciation
So,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I said a couple of kids,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I guess I should have specified,#Statement-opinion
I have four#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
four little boys,#Other
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Four boys.#Repeat-phrase
You bet.#Appreciation
Oh, my goodne-,#Appreciation
You bet.#Appreciation
It's just me and my sister.#Statement-non-opinion
All right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And my parents divorced three years ago#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my sister had gotten through college,#Statement-non-opinion
but I was still in high school,#Statement-non-opinion
and my mother paid for a lot of my sister's college while my parents were together#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then, uh, before the divorce she had saved for my college.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, when we had the divorce, she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So now my dad's paying for all of my college of#Statement-non-opinion
Well, good,#Appreciation
good.#Appreciation
And financial aid#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and scholarships.#Other
I'm a music major,#Statement-non-opinion
so I have auditions coming up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, what year are you in in college?#Wh-Question
I'm a sophomore.#Statement-non-opinion
You're a sophomore,#Response Acknowledgement
so you have a few more years.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Right,#Affirmative non-yes answers
right,#Affirmative non-yes answers
I'll, I'll probably have about, two, two and a half years left.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, good for you.#Appreciation
Good for you.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
I imagine it, uh, is a little difficult to stick with a budget during that, during school and so it forth.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Oh, it sure is.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I, I know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks#Statement-non-opinion
Yes#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I, and I don't spend over that#Statement-non-opinion
Well, great,#Appreciation
great.#Appreciation
And sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and, and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on, too.#Summarize/reformulate
Oh, sure,#Agree/Accept
there's, there's always music#Statement-non-opinion
Lab fees and all,#Summarize/reformulate
books to buy.#Other
Oh, yes,#Agree/Accept
oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
Well, you're not a starving artist, yet, are you?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, no,#No answers
no,#No answers
no.#No answers
Good.#Appreciation
I don't plan on being a starving artist#Statement-non-opinion
Well, good.#Appreciation
That's why I'm in college#Statement-non-opinion
The-, there's enough of those in the world, huh?#Yes-No-Question
Right#Affirmative non-yes answers
Good,#Agree/Accept
good,#Agree/Accept
I'm glad to hear that, Wendy.#Statement-non-opinion
W-,#Uninterpretable
That's usually because they're not real educated.#Statement-opinion
They can't afford to have a really good job.#Statement-opinion
Who's, who's not very well educated?#Signal-non-understanding
The starving ones.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes,#Agree/Accept
yes.#Agree/Accept
There's enough out there that if you have, if you're educated enough, then you can make money.#Statement-opinion
That's true,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
I found that out.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So that's why I'm planning and, and preparing for the, uh, education of my children, also#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
try and set that money aside.#Other
What did you major in?#Wh-Question
I majored in business administration.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, good,#Appreciation
you know plenty about planning a b-, a budget.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but, uh, once again,#Uninterpretable

Well, do you exercise regularly, Judy?#Yes-No-Question
Um, I try to ride the stationary bicycle every day about five miles#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I love to walk,#Statement-non-opinion
so if I have a lunch hour with nice weather I get out and, and walk.#Statement-non-opinion
What about you?#Open-Question
Well, um, I, uh, exercise regularly.#Statement-non-opinion
I work at a university,#Statement-non-opinion
and I swim almost every day#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, very good.#Appreciation
upwards of a mile,#Other
but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, my daughter lives in Arlington,#Statement-non-opinion
and when I go to visit her, I love to get out on that bike trail, and either ride the bike, oh,#Statement-non-opinion
gosh, you can ride a bike practically all the way to Southern Virginia#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or just get out and walk, uh, or even jog a little, although I don't do that regularly.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But Washington's a great place to do that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there are, there are lots of bike paths.#Statement-non-opinion
I know, my son is a biker#Statement-non-opinion
and he, he's done the whole canal, I think it's a hundred and eighty miles, with the scouts.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so, but that somehow takes,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
organization.#Other
For me, it's much easier just the stationary bike,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, it's at home, I can, I can do some of my reading,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, but,#Uninterpretable
Do you live in the District?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I live in Maryland.#Statement-non-opinion
Because I think there're so many parts of the District where it's not very safe to get out and walk.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's it, um,#Uninterpretable
at work we have a, a nice campus,#Statement-non-opinion
so I'm able to, um, take advantage of, of the environment here.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, the neighborhood, also.#Other
I mean, we're within walking distance of, of stores and shops#Statement-non-opinion
so I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Now, I think, um,#Uninterpretable
basically, is your motive simply, um, health or because you enjoy it?#Or-Clause
Well, it's, uh, it's really both.#Other answers
I'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, and most of the time I enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
Sometimes I don't,#Statement-non-opinion
but I feel that, uh, that the discipline it affords me when I do it when I don't want to is also worth something.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
I think pretty much you summed up my, my, my motivations also.#Statement-non-opinion
And I often find that even when I don't feel that much like exercising,#Statement-non-opinion
like I'll be really tired,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'll start swimming,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'll, and I'll actually get energy.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'll be, have much more energy when I'm done than when I started,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I just feel great.#Statement-non-opinion
That happens to me probably one in four or five times that I swim.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, that's great,#Appreciation
that's great.#Appreciation
And that's really a terrific feeling, because you just go there at the end of the day, and you figure, God, I'm ready for bed#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you exercise and then, it's sort of painful for a while,#Other
but by the time you get done you feeling really terrific.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And actually in, in summer I like to swim.#Statement-non-opinion
We don't have facilities for swimming in winter,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, and, and that's true, when I go home from work at the end of the day, if I go up for an hour in the pool, I'm much, much more awake,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
So, can I just ask you, are you Canadian?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I'm not.#Statement-non-opinion
Philadelphia?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
I'm trying to because you have a, you have one funny vowel that's probably going to drive the T I people crazy.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Say out, instead of out you say out.#Statement-non-opinion
Did you know that?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I don't know that.#Statement-non-opinion
But, I, I must say, that, um, when, when I did do a linguistics course in, in school, ages ago, um, the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's probably because I, I, I was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California,#Statement-non-opinion
and at that point that was sort of the limit#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but since then I've been abroad a lot,#Other
so.#Other
I see.#Appreciation
It's a mixture.#Other
I know this isn't on our topic,#Statement-non-opinion
but where did you grow up in California?#Wh-Question
In Santa Barbara.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay,#Response Acknowledgement
because I grew up in North Hollywood, California#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Appreciation
went to U C L A and all that.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, very good,#Appreciation
I think we've probably know, know each other's exercise habits#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
and, uh, it was nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Well, same here.#Conventional-closing
Thanks for calling.#Conventional-closing
Oh, okay.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay.#Other
So what do you, uh, think is the, uh, the worst culprit for air pollution?#Wh-Question
Well, I think it's, it's probably a combination of things.#Statement-opinion
Um, factories that, that burn coal as a, an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants, you know,#Statement-opinion
and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain,#Statement-opinion
and I think that's, that's probably hurting us a little bit.#Statement-opinion
It's hurting, you know, it's hurting Germany, for example, too, and some other parts of Europe where they, where they have high industry.#Statement-opinion
So we're not the lone ranger here.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, uh, I,#Uninterpretable
it's hard to put the finger on, uh, what's worse, you know, the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion, um, with, uh, your hydrocarbons, uh#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
causing the damage in which,#Other
Hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit,#Statement-opinion
but I know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot.#Statement-opinion
Well, I notice on one of these, uh, home shopping networks they were selling these, uh, halogen, uh, fire extinguishers#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the halogen is, uh, an ozone depleter,#Statement-non-opinion
and it got hydrocarbons in there.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a very clean, uh, fire extinguisher,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's, you know, really bad on the environment.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess I missed that one.#Appreciation
Uh.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Automobiles of course are contributing, too,#Statement-opinion
and, you know, how, how we are with our love affair with the auto#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
kind of hard to do anything about that, I guess.#Statement-opinion
I know,#Agree/Accept
uh, in the Twin Cities area,#Uninterpretable
I just moved out of there and was kind of happy I timed it just right,#Statement-non-opinion
but they had a new policy where in order to get your, uh, your license, uh, your car license, uh, renewed, you had to meet the pollution standards#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh.#Uninterpretable
We have that here, too,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's part of the inspection sticker, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
they put a probe in your exhaust pipe#Statement-non-opinion
and, and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that's, you know, that's the way they're dealing with it here.#Other
Yeah, uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess that was just mainly in the cities there,#Statement-non-opinion
and as far as where I live, I don't have to do that,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have an old car which I doubt would, uh, would, uh, pass the inspection, a seventy-six,#Other
and, uh, you know, there's no way I would put in a lot of money to, to repair it#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to meet standards.#Other
It'd probably be difficult anyway.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, although I do what I can to, to cut down pollution,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh.#Uninterpretable
I was just reading an article in, uh, MOTHER EARTH NEWS, MOTHER EARTH NEWS magazine#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, they've got a new, uh,#Uninterpretable
you know a lot of places are burning wood#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a lot, a lot of people are burning wood,#Statement-non-opinion
those of us who have,#Uninterpretable
I've got a place in the country, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, they've had catalytic con-, you know, catalytic converters on those, on,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, I think they're required in California and Oregon and, and Washington,#Statement-non-opinion
but they've had up those for quite a while,#Statement-non-opinion
and somebody's come up with a new one that, uh, sort of,#Statement-non-opinion
it's a, it's a catalytic converter,#Statement-non-opinion
it's, it's a plate that fits in, you know, into the smoke pipe#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, apparently it sort of feeds itself.#Statement-non-opinion
The more smoke is produced, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
after you get to like five hundred degrees, the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is.#Statement-non-opinion
And it sounds real neat.#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't seen them priced anywhere yet,#Statement-non-opinion
but that, that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, old, old, uh, older stoves that don't have any kind of E P A requirements on them.#Other
That might help a little bit, especially in some places.#Statement-opinion
We're really lucky here.#Statement-non-opinion
We have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now sometimes we get a kind of a,#Statement-non-opinion
especially in, in, uh, autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us,#Statement-non-opinion
but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Probably blowing up there to you guys#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, well around here I, we get, uh,#Uninterpretable
well it depends, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
either in the, in the winter time it, it blows it your way,#Statement-non-opinion
and in the#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
summer time#Other
It comes back.#Collaborative Completion
we probably get yours.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I really think, uh, you know, we're doing some, some important things.#Statement-opinion
Education, raising consciousness awareness,#Statement-opinion
uh, I know school kids,#Uninterpretable
I work for the school district here,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, you know, this is one of the big things with kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Kids are writing letters to the newspapers about, you know, telling adults to#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
clean up their act#Other
and, it's uh, you know,#Uninterpretable
I hope we're not too late with it.#Statement-opinion
We're, we're, uh, we're having all kinds of recycling.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well, it, uh, th-, that's a big thing, too.#Statement-opinion
I know it has nothing to do with air pollution,#Statement-non-opinion
but I kind of look at the way people treat our,#Uninterpretable

Okay, um,#Other
do you participate in family reunions?#Yes-No-Question
I did for years.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I don't have enough family left to have them.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But.#Uninterpretable
Did you, uh,#Yes-No-Question
were they far away,#Yes-No-Question
were they close?#Yes-No-Question
Well, I come from a family that was very large in Bell County#Hold before answer/agreement
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and my grandfather came to Bell County on a covered wagon#Hold before answer/agreement
Oh, how neat.#Appreciation
and had ten children,#Other
and so sometimes we would have a reunion with that group.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then, sometimes we would go to Arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that would be fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it was a lot of fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, we, uh, we have a family reunion on my mother's side of the family that's, uh, oh,#Statement-non-opinion
it started probably about forty years ago, uh, because I remember going as a teenager before I was ever married,#Statement-non-opinion
and then my husband and I went, uh, while we were still dating,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's still going on,#Statement-non-opinion
and it used to be held at Lake Brownwood, down at Brownwood, Texas,#Statement-non-opinion
but now we hold it at, uh, Lake Texoma so that the Oklahoma group doesn't have to drive as far.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, we have had as many on a Saturday night,#Statement-non-opinion
it starts on Friday and goes through Sunday,#Statement-non-opinion
and we've had as many on a, uh, Saturday night as about two hundred and fifty.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, now we would have group like that in Arkansas.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We'd have two hundred and fifty or three hundred.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we took, uh,#Uninterpretable
our family all brought in food and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, so many of us came from a long way that we, we'd usually at a motel#Statement-non-opinion
and we bought food there.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I know on Sundays we all elect now to chip in#Statement-non-opinion
and we go get Kentucky#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Fried Chicken and bring out.#Other
And, uh, but we kind of take our food for three days,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, now our grandchildren are participating in it#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just love that they have all this little batch of cousins that they get to see#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
about once a year#Other
enthused and with it#Statement-non-opinion
and our children, you know, thoroughly enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's been kind of nice.#Statement-non-opinion
It started out when I was a youngster and watching my mother.#Statement-non-opinion
Now I'm to the mother was#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I am, uh, now the older generation and doing more of the cooking and watching my daughter#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, partici-, more and everything,#Other
and, uh.#Uninterpretable
Well, it's something I really miss, because I had twenty-seven first cousins#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my word.#Appreciation
and, you know, we were very close family,#Statement-non-opinion
but our father's generation was enough older than I,#Statement-non-opinion
my father would be a hundred now#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that they're all dead,#Other
and, in fact, many of my first cousins are dead#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, are they?#Backchannel in question form
and of course they have their own families and grandchildren and all that,#Statement-non-opinion
so we really, very rarely all of us get together#Statement-non-opinion
Get together any more.#Collaborative Completion
and, and we're a long way away,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and the younger generation, the next like my cousin's children, I don't know very well, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it,#Uninterpretable
so it's,#Uninterpretable
I doubt that that will come to be again,#Statement-non-opinion
but as long as my oldest aunt lived we, we got together once a year.#Statement-non-opinion
I think, I do think, now we have noticed a waning of interest,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and I think as, as parents get older and start dying off, I think sometimes it is hard to keep the interest going.#Statement-opinion
Well, and, and folks have gotten so mobile,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, like I have a son and a daughter and two nephews that are grown#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a brother who has a new marriage and a younger son,#Other
but my brother and his wife live in Nevada, my daughter lives in Colorado, one of my nephews lives in New York City, one nephew lives in Memphis#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my son lives here,#Other
but I think it's very unlikely we'll have a family reunion, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you probably do good just to get your immediate family together.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, I'm divorced,#Statement-non-opinion
and really only immediate family I have left is my, my,#Statement-non-opinion
I have a son and a daughter.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But my family's really all dead.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it was great pleasure while we did it, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're a lot of fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, my si-,#Uninterpretable
I have a sister,#Statement-non-opinion
and then we have a son and a daughter#Statement-non-opinion
and we have three grandchildren#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and our son and daughter are both married#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, our son's not as interested in it as our daughter,#Statement-non-opinion
but our daughter, our daughter is really interested.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh.#Uninterpretable
Does it bother you if your children are not interested in it?#Yes-No-Question
I beg you pardon?#Signal-non-understanding
Does it bother you if your children are not interested in it?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, a little bit.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I, I wish that our son was#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
and, uh, but, uh, the cousins are closer to our daughter's age, and, than to our son's and just totally different,#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's one thing I would like, is just to sort of have, I really don't like uniforms#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

That just bugs me to death.#Statement-non-opinion
I know#Agree/Accept

what else do I wear?#Self-talk
Um, if I were in a bigger market, when I do get into a bigger market, I'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things, and, uh, where I wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things#Statement-non-opinion
and I could#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then I would be able to dress more business-like and things like that,#Other

Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, it's pretty fun though.#Statement-non-opinion
I like the look, the, the like suit look, professional like, you know, look,#Statement-non-opinion

I probably do that about once a month.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, I usually prepare something, depending upon the guests, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it, it, I like to prepare chicken, that seems to please everybody, pasta or a casserole.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How about you?#Open-Question
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
those are things I like the most.#Statement-non-opinion
I like fish and chicken the most.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, most of the cooking I do just comes out of a can.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Unless it is, unless it is, I catch a fish and I prepare it.#Statement-non-opinion
And then I just, uh, you know, I just broil it and put lemon on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, that's about the way I prepare most fish.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I made scallops the other night,#Statement-non-opinion
that was unusual,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, basically, uh, I found a recipe to make it in the microwave#Statement-non-opinion

No,#Reject
no,#Reject
four and a half to five minutes#Statement-non-opinion
and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top,#Statement-non-opinion

Sesame seeds and bread crumbs.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sesame seeds and bread crumbs.#Repeat-phrase
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, my husband liked it.#Statement-non-opinion

unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive, uh, fish items.#Statement-opinion

But, you know, I, I look for them to go on sale at the grocery store#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, one of the things I love to do, eat out.#Statement-non-opinion
How about you?#Open-Question

Right,#Agree/Accept
exactly,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
and that's, that's the other restaurant Black Eye Pea.#Statement-non-opinion

So, I do not really like, uh, you know, uh, uh, chili places or, what is it, Judge Roy Bean's,#Statement-non-opinion
or#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do not like greasy places.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I do not feel like they are very healthy,#Statement-opinion

feel like the home cooking places, are, are the healthiest meals.#Other
You know, I tend to have chicken fried steak when I go, go to them.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I, and I got, uh, chicken marinara the last two times.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how was it?#Wh-Question
It was, uh, it was great.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because that's, that's what I like,#Statement-non-opinion
I do not like it, you know. I just like a baked, you know, a piece of chicken#Statement-non-opinion
and then I get like green beans and mashed potatoes.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
I, I tend to, uh, I get teased by my family a lot, because, uh, I like experimenting on, on food#Statement-non-opinion
and sometimes I go for ex-, fairly exotic things.#Statement-non-opinion
And my father teases me about gourmet cooking.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which is not always true,#Other
but and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else, is that some of the experiments fail.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
Uh, the last time we had some, uh, friends over for dinner, I tried a dessert that sounded wonder-, wonderful in the recipe#Statement-non-opinion
and it was just a total bust.#Statement-non-opinion
I was,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sorry I did not have ice cream to fall back on.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My, uh, my brother tried to make, uh, a bunch of things, uh, way back.#Statement-non-opinion
He tried to make bagels one time.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh my that's ambitious.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and, uh, we took some#Statement-non-opinion
and then we had, uh, German Shepherds at the time,#Statement-non-opinion
and we took some and gave it to the dogs,#Statement-non-opinion
and the dog never, you know, he treated it like a milk bone#Statement-non-opinion
and he never did finish it.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He just barely made a dent in it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and, uh, then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, uh, supposed to be candy.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, it, it did not turn out very well,#Statement-non-opinion
it was, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into, uh, into a kind of a candy stick,#Other
so, uh.#Uninterpretable
Huh, see I am not,#Uninterpretable
that's interesting.#Appreciation
One of the things I do not make is dessert.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation, because, uh, you know, we have ice cream, or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
And that's why when I took, did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was just a total fiasco.#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, everything else was fine,#Statement-non-opinion
but that was a fiasco.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you have to put eggs and everything, don't you.#Yes-No-Question
Or,#Uninterpretable
Uh, yeah.#Yes answers
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
just about.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I, I also don't have much of a sweet tooth,#Statement-non-opinion
so I can live without, live without dessert for the most part.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Use about half the sugar,#Action-directive
or make everything diet.#Action-directive
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Uh, do you cook for yourself#Yes-No-Question
or do you cook for others?#Or-Clause
Mostly, I just cook for myself.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, when I was single, I used to, uh, I think my favorite meal was a, a baked potato.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
It's easy,#Statement-opinion
that's for sure.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Repeat-phrase
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
And, I mean, I never put anything other than a little butter on it,#Statement-non-opinion
if I had, or if I had a little cheddar cheese, sometimes I would grate that up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I always put cheese on them.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, it's amazingly satisfying.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but, you know, there's hardly any, I guess there's hardly any protein,#Statement-opinion
it's mostly starch.#Statement-opinion
So, it fills you up#Statement-opinion
and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I did-, I did not say it was nourishing,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was satisfying.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
it really is.#Agree/Accept
And,#Uninterpretable
Then you have to make a salad#Statement-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah#Agree/Accept
tha-, but, you know, I never really enjoyed cooking for myself,#Statement-non-opinion
so I ate very simply.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I was, that's why, I think that's one reason I like having people over, because I could try things.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I must be a frustrated chemist or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Cause cooking is a little bit like, like being in a chemistry lab.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
Except you get to taste the product instead .#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
and have an explosion.#Statement-opinion
Fill them up#Statement-opinion
or blow up.#Statement-opinion
Sometimes it blows up anyway.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
I, I once had a, an old boy friend over to, to dinner when I was recently staying with my parents.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, I had this wonderful recipe#Statement-non-opinion
and you were supposed to make a, a toffee like substance for a pie by, uh, boiling evaporated milk three hours,#Statement-non-opinion
and it does turn to toffee inside the can.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the only problem was, when I opened the can, it just flew all over the place.#Statement-non-opinion
It was on the ceiling, on the walls and me.#Statement-non-opinion
And, and the boy friend thought,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
it was, he was supposed to be there at six o'clock, not seven o'clock,#Statement-non-opinion
so just at the time all this happened, the door bell rang#Statement-non-opinion
and there he was.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And I had to have my, my, my, my dad sort of entertain him for a, for#Statement-non-opinion

for awhile while my mother and I scrambled to clean everything up.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Did you let the can cool off?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, I really do not remember,#Other answers
that was about ten years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
I just remember how embarrassing it was.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I have made, I have made it since, I've, I, and several times before#Statement-non-opinion
and I never had that problem,#Statement-non-opinion
just that one time.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh. Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, he, he was a gourmet cook,#Statement-non-opinion
he was kind of pushy too.#Statement-non-opinion
Acted like, he came from San Francisco#Statement-non-opinion
and he had a very sophisticated taste.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I really wanted to impress the heck out of him#Statement-non-opinion
and, and well, it was a memorable evening anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, as far as,#Uninterpretable
I, I do enjoy cooking#Statement-non-opinion
so, I was awfully glad I was given this,#Statement-non-opinion

Actually, I don't.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Backchannel in question form
No,#No answers
uh, I, uh, when I was younger, I played a little bit#Statement-non-opinion

Wow,#Appreciation
that is real good.#Statement-opinion
So, uh,#Uninterpretable

So, I have been playing now,#Statement-non-opinion
well I have had clubs for twenty years, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow,#Appreciation
so you have been playing,#Summarize/reformulate

Well, have you played recently?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
actually, I don't even know if I checked that or not, to be perfectly honest. Um#Statement-non-opinion

I have not played in a long time.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, when I was,#Statement-non-opinion
about five or six years ago, my dad , who plays every now and then took me out with him#Statement-non-opinion

It wound up tossing the ball into the trees,#Statement-non-opinion

virtually every time.#Other

the slice goes to the right#Statement-non-opinion
and the hook goes to the left,#Statement-non-opinion
I think.#Hedge

I was slicing, actually.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as it turns out, uh, I went and took some lessons for awhile, because I just, I would lose so many balls, and, uh, make it a horrible time for everybody.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I went and took some lessons,#Statement-non-opinion
and a I got a little bit better,#Statement-non-opinion
but I st-, but then I sort of, you know, went, went back to school and did not have time and this and that,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and the only thing I do now is I occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what I can do.#Statement-non-opinion
And I,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's really a good thing to do.#Statement-opinion
So, where,#Wh-Question

Occasionally, uh, uh,#Uninterpretable
a bunch of us were pretty avid golfers.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

we play a par, a par three, nine hole course.#Statement-non-opinion
Because,#Uninterpretable

.#Other
Because, for a woman, it's really nice to play a par three course because,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's my, I can't hit a driver very far#Other
and, in fact, I don't even like to use a driver,#Statement-non-opinion
I use a three iron off the tee#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
because, I have more control over it.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, I can, I can just have better contact with the ball that way.#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's, um, not only that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, it's exceedingly well kept, apparently.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Appreciation
Because, th-, those are the comments I kept hearing from the pros, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
they kept saying, we hear, you know, on, on television I,#Statement-non-opinion
but, they keep saying it's just wonderful, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
the course is so well maintained#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, it, it, it rained through half the um, tournament, so people had to ,#Statement-non-opinion

I'm sure the people love golf up there like they do down here.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh.#Uninterpretable
People are just cra-,#Statement-opinion
golf is just,#Statement-opinion
it's just the coming thing,#Statement-opinion
I mean a lot of people are just crazy about it.#Statement-opinion

and you sort of stink, like me,#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Statement-opinion
and you sort of play every now and then.#Statement-opinion
it's, it's just such a difficult thing.#Other
I mean it's, I just, I watch my husband#Statement-non-opinion
and he's, he was a professional athlete,#Statement-non-opinion
he, he's a very good athlete#Statement-non-opinion
and he's got the coordination, that God given coordination,#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, same here, I mean, I'm a brown belt in Karate at this point in time.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh my, really!#Appreciation
And, and I can not, and I can not hit a golf ball#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know I,#Uninterpretable
Because it,#Uninterpretable
well, I watch my husband swing#Statement-non-opinion
and his swing, you know, like compared to the pros, is so, it's ridged.#Statement-non-opinion
It's like he's trying so hard, it's not that flowing movement.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Other
That's because he's probably doing what I do, worrying about,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is my head straight, is my arm right,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is this correct, am I holding correctly, stuff like that. * slash error#Other
Or, how far he's going to hit it, I think, you know.#Summarize/reformulate

And I worry about that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
I have just got to get this drive, you know, really far,#Statement-non-opinion
I have got to hit it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have this nasty habit of of turning my head at the last second, or,#Statement-non-opinion
Yep,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or,#Uninterpretable
or just keeping my arm wrong.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
turning your head is probably the most common thing for women,#Statement-non-opinion
Is it?#Yes-No-Question
they say.#Other
And you are always so anxious to see where it goes.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
It's just like I, I don't watch the ball die,#Statement-non-opinion
I have .#Statement-non-opinion
It took me a long time to learn to wait until the ball was in the air before I looked up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I have to that, especially, even more so, with a short iron than a long ir-, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, driver.#Collaborative Completion
than with a driver or something.#Other
Because, those short irons, it's just, you want to look up#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
cause you are getting close to the green#Other
and you want to see it hit the green.#Statement-opinion
And you know that's why,#Statement-opinion
Watch where it's going.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so.#Statement-non-opinion
That, that is certainly true#Agree/Accept
thank you .#Thanking
I ca-, I don't know what I'm supposed to ask questions about,#Other
am I supposed to ask questions about this whole procedure,#Yes-No-Question
I know that.#Statement-non-opinion
That's okay,#Agree/Accept
go ahead,#Action-directive
it's no big deal.#Downplayer
Well, uh, when I,#Statement-non-opinion

Both.#Statement-non-opinion
Both.#Repeat-phrase
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
I believe so.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well I really did not know so I,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I, I actually don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
I get a random reimbursement every now and then and don't really#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
don't really figure it out,#Other
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
until afterward#Other
Cause this is only my second day doing it#Statement-non-opinion
and I just did not, I did not know#Statement-non-opinion
and that was .#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the details,#Other
we, I just started yesterday.#Statement-non-opinion
I have been doing this for awhile, actually.#Statement-non-opinion
Have you?#Backchannel in question form
It seems like it's been a while.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they just, I just,#Statement-non-opinion
I had a ,#Statement-non-opinion
get these random checks in the mail every now and then#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
I see.#Response Acknowledgement
My wife and I both do it, as a matter of fact.#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Response Acknowledgement
And we both just, sort of, get these random checks in the mail#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
To be honest, I, I really have not been accounting,#Other
I just sort of figured, well, it's going to work.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, if it works, it works.#Statement-non-opinion
So ,#Uninterpretable
Well, my, uh,#Uninterpretable

So what do you think?#Open-Question
Should they, uh, should young Americans be forced to do a year of service?#Yes-No-Question
I don't, I don't think they should be forced,#Statement-opinion
but I think they should be, I guess, encouraged to, to do some kind of public work, I guess to, just to get them, I guess involved with community maybe, you know,#Statement-opinion
just community activity.#Statement-opinion
If nothing else, see how the city works, stuff like that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think something like the Peace Corps is a bit harsh.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No kids,#Statement-opinion
I kind of, I think so, too.#Agree/Accept
I think that's a bit dramatic,#Statement-opinion
but, but other than that I think it's, it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and, you know, like the, uh, shelters and, uh, that kind of, thing,#Statement-opinion
Vol-,#Uninterpretable
helping out, uh, volunteering, I guess, if they can.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, I'd force them.#Statement-opinion
I think that, uh, I think it would be, I think mo-, I think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work#Statement-opinion
and no one just realizes it.#Statement-opinion
Your right,#Agree/Accept
I do, too,#Agree/Accept
I think they start out young, like in, uh, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
doing s-,#Other
I was a, I was a Boy Scout.#Statement-non-opinion
As part of being a Boy Scout, you had to do, you know, projects all throughout#Statement-non-opinion
and then to become#Statement-non-opinion
Ex-,#Uninterpretable
an Eagle Scout you have to spend a, do a yearlong project.#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
that's, see that's what we did in Girl Scouts#Statement-non-opinion
and that got you involved real good#Statement-non-opinion
and it, I think it starts kids out on the right track#Statement-opinion
and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Something,#Uninterpretable
I think, I, I, now I think people generally volunteer.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That there's no problem with getting them to,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
do stuff.#Other
I do, too.#Agree/Accept
I think, I think a lot of people, a lot more people volunteer than, than, uh, than we, than get credit for it as, you know, like in hospitals and, uh, and the shelters and stuff like that.#Statement-opinion
And even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays, I mean at least they're getting out and doing it and you know, helping, helping out.#Statement-opinion
I think that's good#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Well, we have a funny commercial around here.#Statement-non-opinion
It says something like, if people were to give five,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
hours a week or five percent of their salary,#Other
.#Non-verbal
we could, they could solve all the world's problems or something.#Other
.#Non-verbal
So,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could, uh,#Other
.#Non-verbal
or just, or just gave, or, or, or just forced our kids just to, to, force kids to serve for, uh, parents, I guess.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept
There you go.#Agree/Accept
Substitute.#Statement-opinion
My, my,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Other
my kid will do four or five hours this week for me.#Statement-opinion
No problem.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it sounds pretty good#Appreciation
That sounds good.#Appreciation
I've noticed a lot of, uh, different organizations in our community, uh, pick up, like on the highway and stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think that's pretty neat.#Statement-opinion
They, uh, go along and have so many miles I guess of highway to take over#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they clean it up.#Statement-non-opinion
I've seen that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
And keep it clean.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that's I pretty good idea.#Statement-opinion
And I think, you know, again#Uninterpretable
I've seen a lot of young kids doing that#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it gets them prepared to, to learn how to volunteer as they get older.#Statement-opinion
I know I did, you know, in Girl Scouts and everything#Statement-non-opinion
and after that in high school I would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that#Statement-non-opinion
They, they,#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
just started trying to get them, something together l-, l-, like, like that around here from, for, from the community because, uh, we had a big ice storm#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, very, very recently.#Other
You don't sound like you're in the north.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
You sound like you're in the south somewhere.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I'm in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Where are you at?#Wh-Question
Yeah, uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm in, uh, New York.#Statement-non-opinion
New York.#Response Acknowledgement
Upstate New York,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Oh, gosh.#Appreciation
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Long way, uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we just had a really big ice storm.#Statement-non-opinion
And, basically, half the trees in, in our city, I'm in Rochester which is, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right upstate. Half of the trees in the city, uh, are no good anymore.#Other
Oh, no.#Appreciation
That's how bad it was.#Statement-non-opinion
Everything is just down everywhere.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, we had three hundred thousand people without power.#Statement-non-opinion
Golly.#Appreciation
You know, it was,#Uninterpretable
and, you know, and, and they, and we didn't have power for a week#Statement-non-opinion
and there are still people who don't have power.#Statement-non-opinion
Are you serious?#Backchannel in question form
Oh, yeah,#Yes answers
it's been, it's been, it's been ten days already#Statement-non-opinion
and there are still something like ten thousand people without power.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh my God,#Appreciation
how do they live?#Rhetorical-Questions
and were officially, yeah,#Statement-non-opinion
and we're officially in a state of emergency.#Statement-non-opinion
Funny thing is the news, the national news how they covered it. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I haven't heard a thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and we've been in a state of emergency for over, you know, for ten or eleven days.#Other
Lord.#Appreciation
You know.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We just got our phone back today, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Go-,#Uninterpretable
and, and, they're you know, putting out ads now for people to come volunteer,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
or to have their organizations come,#Other
.#Non-verbal
volunteer to help clean up the streets.#Other
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
That's great.#Appreciation
Because we have, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
every-, everywhere that a tree is down people need help#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we're all, all, a lot of older folks need help getting,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
their yards cleaned out because they can't afford to pay anyone#Other
and they,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and they certainly can't carry it themselves#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Right *#Other
So,#Uninterpretable
That's one thing we do at our church is, uh, we have a group called Hearts and Hammers,#Other
and we go along#Statement-non-opinion
and, I'm really not sure how we find the individuals,#Statement-non-opinion
but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that n-, desperately need it,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we go along with all the material and in one day, more or less, go in and say, roof, paint, fix whatever we can.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's great.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and spend a day doing,#Statement-non-opinion
that's really neat.#Appreciation
I mean, it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time,#Statement-non-opinion
but you know, every little bit helps.#Statement-non-opinion
And is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Uh, yeah.#Yes answers
They, uh, luckily we have a, a man who owns a building company.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, so he,#Uninterpretable
So he donates a lot, not everything, but a lot of the material.#Statement-non-opinion
Then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy.#Statement-non-opinion
That's real nice.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
And it's not, you know, we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so much as, we just want to help people out.#Other
So it's real neat.#Appreciation
That,#Appreciation
It's,#Uninterpretable
that's real good.#Other
And I, and I bet it gives you a real good feeling#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Other
it's#Statement-non-opinion
to be doing that.#Other
like I say,#Other
it's not a lot,#Statement-non-opinion
but it helps people.#Statement-non-opinion
Like this last couple we helped, you know, they were in their eighties#Statement-non-opinion
and she was bedridden#Statement-non-opinion
and, I just, you know, just tears your heart out to#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to see this kind of thing#Other
and you know, if you can do any a little bit, it helps,#Statement-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
That's, that's, uh, that's real good.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We had, uh, we had organizations like that in college, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
We had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups#Statement-non-opinion
and some did like that, some did elderly visits,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
some did, uh, some did, you know, Big Brother, Big Sister, stuff like that.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'm convinced that, that, that at least twenty-five percent of our school participated in some sort of a, some sort of group. You know,#Statement-non-opinion
Gosh.#Appreciation
ac-, activity like that.#Other
That's great.#Appreciation
That's a lot.#Appreciation
You know. Twenty-five, I don't know. Twenty-five percent?#3rd-party-talk
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
my wife was big in that#Statement-non-opinion
That's, that's a lot of kids, though.#Statement-opinion
And she thinks, yeah,#Statement-non-opinion
twenty-five percent.#Statement-non-opinion
It, it was a small school#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well,#Statement-opinion
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
still that's a, you know, that's a good chunk of kids.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but, I mean, a, a, a lot of people would get involved#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, because there were all different,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
organizations to do.#Other
There was Big Brother, Big Sister,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they had a yearly auction,#Statement-non-opinion
they had a dance marathon for charity or, to, to support that,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
group.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's neat.#Appreciation
Such that, you know, lots of people got involved that way.#Statement-non-opinion
That's great.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's great.#Appreciation
But, uh, like, I'll agree with you, though,#Agree/Accept
I don't think they should have to do a year#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
no,#Agree/Accept
neither do I.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
I think it should be completely optional#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
I don't think that, some people I don't think have, uh, a year in them to volunteer if you know what I mean.#Statement-opinion
They're not worth it#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they're not worth a year.#Agree/Accept
Or some people unfort-, just, just can't even afford it,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know, whatever.#Other
I mean,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the Peace Corps doesn't pay very well. You know?#Other
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
People get shipped off#Statement-opinion
and then, you know, and then, and then their parents,#Statement-opinion
I have a, uh, a, a friend whose, whose son is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala, or daughter is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, he and his wife just went off to visit her#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, I know I could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala.#Statement-non-opinion
I couldn't either.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, so#Uninterpretable
I couldn't either.#Statement-non-opinion
so I think, you know,#Uninterpretable
and, and, and the kid's certainly not making much money.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
So I can see where that, that,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
may be a problem.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I just know one person that's in the Peace Corps#Statement-non-opinion
and, I mean, she's a teacher and, and just wanted to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
She'd been a teacher for a while.#Statement-non-opinion
Just decided she wanted to do it,#Statement-non-opinion
so. I mean, I'm grateful for people like that,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I don't see how they can just,#Other
Just take off a year.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Other
just,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
pick up and head on out.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I don't,#Agree/Accept
I wish I could do something like that,#Statement-non-opinion
but I can't,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well neither can I,#Statement-non-opinion
so, I, I, I, I, I, I,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
did my service before#Other
and I'll do my little community service throughout, but never#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's the way I am.#Statement-non-opinion
never for a year again.#Other
I know the feeling.#Appreciation
So, so I guess our vote is no#Declarative Yes-No-Question
That's right#Affirmative non-yes answers
We're against it#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Well, it's been nice talking to you again.#Conventional-closing
You, too,#Conventional-closing
and I hope everything works out up there.#Conventional-closing
Well, yeah,#Conventional-closing
we're, we're slowly getting everything back together again.#Conventional-closing
You know, it, it's taking time,#Conventional-closing
but#Conventional-closing
Yeah.#Conventional-closing
everything, you know,#Other
we got lucky.#Conventional-closing
We had no damage to our house or anything#Conventional-closing
so,#Conventional-closing
Good,#Conventional-closing

that's great.#Conventional-closing
The rest will just have to come with time.#Other

The only problems I had with it in the nine years that I owned it, I had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
And that was the only major problem that I had, I mean,#Statement-non-opinion
I had like little piddly things like#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I had to replace the muffler#Other
and I had replaced the tires#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, seems like it had a radiator leak once.#Statement-non-opinion
But I never had any major anything,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
other than the compressor.#Other
I really never had anything major with my Mazda#Statement-non-opinion
but it was a standard also#Statement-non-opinion
and the clutch went out on it toward the end,#Statement-non-opinion
I had it five years#Statement-non-opinion
and the last year, last two years it seemed to go out really easily.#Statement-non-opinion
I think it went out twice in two years#Statement-non-opinion
and that's, that's a lot#Statement-opinion
it shouldn't go out that much.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Agree/Accept
And so I went ahead and bought another standard when I bought the Honda#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't think I'm going to do that again.#Statement-non-opinion
I think I'm going back to automatic now.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I never, well,#Statement-non-opinion
I kind of know how to drive standard#Statement-non-opinion
but I've never owned one#Statement-non-opinion
so I hadn't, I don't drive one a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I don't feel comfortable in traffic with it.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And for everything I've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Agree/Accept
And,#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
and resale value is really important to me#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is me too#Statement-non-opinion
that's why I got the Honda.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Hondas have great resale value.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The Mazda definitely did not#Statement-non-opinion
Not at all.#Statement-non-opinion
They're worse than American cars I think or just as bad as far as resale goes.#Statement-non-opinion
I did pretty well with my, uh, Regal because it was in really good shape#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it still looked real nice,#Other
the, the interior was still really nice,#Statement-non-opinion
there wasn't cracks all over the dash board and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it had some, some nice features.#Statement-non-opinion
So I ended up okay with the Buick,#Statement-non-opinion
Good.#Appreciation
and I anticipate the same thing with the Honda whenever I decide to sell it,#Statement-non-opinion
of course, I may never sell it#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I may drive it until it's dead#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's what I did with the Mazda, drive it until the, until the clutch went out and the wheels fell off,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, probably what I'll do again.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I really like the Hondas.#Statement-non-opinion
I like foreign cars#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a lot.#Other
Well,#Uninterpretable
I looked at the Mitsubishi Galant.#Statement-non-opinion
I was looking for a four door car having driven the R X Seven so long,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it was so small#Statement-non-opinion
and it's really impractical.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I wanted something with a real trunk, and four doors something easy to get in and out of#Statement-non-opinion
and I looked at the Galant#Statement-non-opinion
and those were really nice#Statement-non-opinion
and I can get them for a great price.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I found it hard to deal with the, the dealership I was going through.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, that's how I ended up with a Honda.#Statement-non-opinion
I wasn't even looking for a car when I bought this car.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh, I was thinking about buying a Prelude from a friend who was moving to New York or something#Statement-non-opinion
so and she was going to sell her car because she didn't need it anymore#Statement-non-opinion
and it was only like a year old#Statement-non-opinion
and I had never driven, uh, a Prelude.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I went to a dealership because they had like, uh, the same year and same model,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of Prelude on their used car lot#Other
and I went and I test drove it#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, I just fell in love,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with this brand new white Prelude, uh, you know,#Other
They're nice I think.#Statement-opinion
two liter S I with the sun roof and the moon roof#Other
and I,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
bought it loaded.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
I have to have them loaded,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Uninterpretable
um, I love all those little things that you don't need#Statement-non-opinion
but they're so wonderful.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I went there looking at a used car#Statement-non-opinion
and two days later I bought this car.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I felt like, I felt like that was the worst impulse, that was, that was largest impulse that I,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that I had ever made.#Other
The oth-, the two,#Statement-non-opinion
I understand.#Appreciation
other things that I bought on impulse are a V C R and a washer#Other
.#Non-verbal
and dryer.#Other
I go for the big stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I noticed#Statement-non-opinion
Mine was definitely not impulse#Statement-non-opinion
I really needed a new car.#Statement-non-opinion
Mine was just, it was getting worn out I guess from being a sports car.#Statement-non-opinion
I drove it kind of hard,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I got it right after high school.#Statement-non-opinion
So, by the time I traded it in it was ready.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I got,#Statement-non-opinion
Ready to go. * I really think this should be a continuation of B.101 utt 2.#Statement-non-opinion
I got my Buick as a high school graduation gift.#Other
Did you?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
But I, I guess this wasn't really an impulse, I mean,#Statement-non-opinion
buying it right then and, you know, right quickly was kind of impulsive#Statement-non-opinion
but I'd been thinking about buying a new car for about three years#Statement-non-opinion
and I was just scared to.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was scared to start taking on payments because the Buick was long since paid for.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
That's the same with me.#Statement-non-opinion
Would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself?#Yes-No-Question
Buy a, wha-, ar-, you,#Signal-non-understanding
Like,#Uninterpretable
buy a used car?#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
Sure.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I, I was going to buy one once#Statement-non-opinion
but I just, I worry about who's driven them and what they've been through and the warranties and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just, I can't seem to get over that.#Statement-non-opinion
That just bothers me#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know why.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, um, like on Hondas they,#Statement-non-opinion
supposedly, the maintenance records was supposed to be registered with Honda or whatever#Statement-non-opinion
and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars#Statement-non-opinion
and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
I mean they can't stop you from doing it.#Statement-non-opinion
Hoping that they do go to a Honda dealership to get them serviced.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, and even if they didn't, you can still get a good idea from a, if you can get a good mechanic to,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
check it over real carefully and check the block and everything.#Other
That's true.#Agree/Accept
So.#Uninterpretable
Well, I guess that's all.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Agree/Accept
Well, I enjoyed talking to you.#Conventional-closing
I enjoyed talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Yeah.#Other
I guess, uh, uh, it's an easy one for me.#Statement-opinion
I think that's, uh, there's something seriously wrong,#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What is it that you are, you know, particularly upset about?#Wh-Question
Uh, I guess, uh, I think they've lost their compass#Statement-opinion
and, uh, I'm not sure they know exactly what, uh, uh, public education supposed to be for anymore.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, I voted with my feet#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, my kids go to parochial school.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh,#Uninterpretable
What do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in a, the public school system?#Open-Question
Well, one hundred percent of the, uh, customers care.#Statement-opinion
That's one thing.#Statement-opinion
Everybody cares about the education the kids are getting.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, they, uh, take an active, relatively active part.#Statement-opinion
Which, uh, I mean if you're, uh, sending two thousand dollars that way every year, you, uh, watch what goes on and you, uh, uh, pay attention and participate#Statement-opinion
and, and you can influence the way things are.#Statement-opinion
So you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of, uh, real estate or other taxes#Summarize/reformulate
and, and, consequently, they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen?#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
The immediacy just isn't there.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, uh, I also think that one of the problems#Statement-opinion
and, actually, I don't think this, I think this is a cultural problem.#Statement-opinion
The, uh, problem with public education is really, uh, really a problem with the culture.#Statement-opinion
And, I guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California, for example, where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school#Statement-opinion
and you can't get a tax levy passed.#Statement-opinion
Uh, people are, uh, reluctant to pass, uh, school tax levies even, uh, when the money is needed or would be well spent because it's, uh, they don't have kids in the schools.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's a, a loss of civic virtue and a loss of, uh, uh, the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids.#Statement-opinion
I think that's, uh, that's the principal problem is that, uh, people no longer see it as, uh, as their problem#Statement-opinion
and there's an immediate problem.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
It troubles me too tha-, that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good#Statement-opinion
and by definition, for some of us, at least, the public good includes having an educated populace and then#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
idea that, uh, you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the, at the local level or bigger votes at#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the national level.#Other
Uh, it means that you've got to be informed#Statement-opinion
and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision.#Other
You know, I, I believe that the original idea of public education in the United States, which I guess was controversial at the time of the constitution.#Statement-opinion
Uh, you know, it barely made it.#Statement-opinion
I think it was added afterwards#Statement-opinion
I think the real, the principal was, uh, education for civic participation.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter#Statement-opinion
and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
It has taken on a more profound,#Statement-opinion
and you'd think we'd notice it, economic uh, thrust.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, that's exactly what I was going to say.#Statement-non-opinion
Now there seem to be really three reasons for education.#Statement-opinion
One is education for civic duty.#Statement-opinion
One is education for economic reasons.#Statement-opinion
And one is education for civilization.#Statement-opinion
I mean and I think that one,#Statement-opinion
Well I'm glad that you added that one.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
I think that one's significant.#Statement-opinion
That's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor#Statement-non-opinion
and then I quit and got disabused of that notion#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, the, uh, uh, now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is, uh, an economic enterprise to train people for jobs.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, I'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is.#Statement-opinion
And I'm really sad to say this,#Statement-non-opinion
I never thought I would have#Statement-non-opinion
but I really think that, uh, the educational establishment has become part of the problem.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, that's why I guess I'm sort of, reluctantly, uh, in favor of these, uh, choice programs.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Well I, I g-, agree with everything that you've said so far#Agree/Accept
and the only that I'd want to add is that I'm a little more in contact, I think, with public school teachers than perhaps you are, uh, except as a parent of your child#Statement-opinion
and the sense that I get from public school teachers that I know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing#Statement-non-opinion
and they are the three things that you mentioned.#Statement-non-opinion
But they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
That's what,#Uninterpretable
like consumer,#Uninterpretable

Anyway, uh#Other
How about you.#Open-Question
What do you do with your budget?#Wh-Question
What do I do,#Self-talk
uh, at the moment it's under chaos.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, right now I'm just, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I don't really have a budget per se.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, I, uh, it's called living within your means#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, which means at the moment, paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
That's true.#Agree/Accept
Uh, but, uh, no#Other
I don't really have a budget at the moment.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, but I have uh, I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month#Statement-non-opinion
and then I don't, usually don't exceed that unless I, unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another, like if I have car expenses#Statement-non-opinion
and then that, then it goes through the moon,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's sort of a problem.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so uh, what do yo-,#Wh-Question
We're trying, we're trying to, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
so far we are in the clear credit wise#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, the other side of it is,#Statement-non-opinion
so, not much on that side of it to add to it.#Statement-non-opinion
We're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
So you can afford to get a house?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
we'd like to do that some day.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
We have this dream.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, we don't know how long it will be a dream.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
We, we're kind of real, we're real happy that we don't have any debt,#Statement-non-opinion
but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this, uh, economy right now#Statement-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what, the little bit that we do get, you know, on top of expenses every month.#Other
So, what do you and your husband do?#Wh-Question
We're missionaries actually.#Statement-non-opinion
Are you really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
uh-huh.#Yes answers
And, uh, it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have, uh, like, uh, uh, support quota#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here.#Statement-non-opinion
No kidding.#Appreciation
And it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home.#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
Overseas, where would you be going?#Wh-Question
Africa,#Statement-non-opinion
Nigeria.#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How long would you be there?#Wh-Question
About four years.#Statement-non-opinion
We're career#Statement-non-opinion
so, we, we go over seas for four years#Statement-non-opinion
and then we come back for a year.#Statement-non-opinion
We go over four,#Statement-non-opinion
we come back for a year.#Statement-non-opinion
With, with what Church?#Wh-Question
Uh, we're with Wycliff Bible Translators.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yes.#Response Acknowledgement
Yes,#Response Acknowledgement
So.#Uninterpretable
I, uh, I know who they are.#Statement-non-opinion
They, uh, they have an office, uh, in in Costa Mesa as I recall.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they could very well#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
There, there was, uh, you know, there was a fairly large building that that was well that belongs to them.#Statement-non-opinion
So, uh, are you, uh, are you, uh, active in translation?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, we will be.#Other answers
I was over, over four years doing language surveying which is the first step.#Statement-non-opinion
You're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, came home and got married#Statement-non-opinion
and we will go ba-, back as translators cause we want to raise a family#Statement-non-opinion
and it is easier to raise a family as translators.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I always wanted to do translation,#Statement-non-opinion
but as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier.#Statement-non-opinion
You know they really need surveyors cause you could, you're free to travel anywhere.#Statement-non-opinion
You don't have kids hanging around you and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
True,#Agree/Accept
true enough.#Agree/Accept
So, uh, what, what, uh, what languages do you speak besides English, of course?#Wh-Question
Well, I have a smattering of about ten different ones,#Statement-non-opinion
but there's,#Uninterpretable
I'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
since I did#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, complete a survey in one area, I'd switch to the other.#Other
So I know the greetings in about ten,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and how to do market stuff,#Other
but in about, uh, about five I guess, I can do better in it.#Statement-non-opinion
And my French is pretty good#Statement-non-opinion
but it's, uh, French#Uninterpretable
so, uh, I'm terrified to speak in, uh#Statement-non-opinion
In France.#Collaborative Completion
in France.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
because they're real snobby about their language#Statement-opinion
and French is street French#Statement-non-opinion
and I just picked it up off the street#Statement-non-opinion
and I knew what I was, I knew what I was communicating,#Statement-non-opinion
but I didn't know what I was saying.#Statement-non-opinion
I never sat there and got a direct translation#Statement-non-opinion
and said something here when I came home and French to somebody#Statement-non-opinion
and he paled and said, uh, I'm not going to tell you what you said.#Statement-non-opinion
So, since then I have refrained from speaking any French#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So.#Uninterpretable
In#Uninterpretable
Uh,#Uninterpretable
I don't know what I said to him#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I didn't ask him either.#Statement-non-opinion
Must have been terrible.#Appreciation
The, uh,#Uninterpretable
was it Henry Macon said that the, the, uh, language was like a man slowly bleeding to death.#Yes-No-Question
So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die#Quotation
and I, it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that.#Statement-opinion
Free style English is just,#Statement-opinion
takes on,#Uninterpretable

Uh, why don't you go ahead first.#Action-directive
Okay.#Agree/Accept
Uh, short term, uh, it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over#Statement-non-opinion
so budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
extra to go around.#Other
Uh, long term is something we're starting to think about because our older child will be ready for college in about, uh, gee,#Statement-non-opinion
she's eight now#Statement-non-opinion
so I guess about ten years.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Good heavens.#Appreciation
So we're, we're starting to think about long term considerations. College and retirement.#Statement-non-opinion
But with not a whole lot of discretionary money, it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How about you?#Open-Question
That's kind of, uh,#Uninterpretable
to what we're doing is budgeting, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Month to month is, uh, kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra#Statement-non-opinion
so that's kind of how we do it, uh, from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, long term, that's a little bit easier for us because, uh, with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings, Four Oh One K plans#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, that kind of, you know, retirement plans, that kind of stuff#Other
so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
versus when it's on the paycheck#Other
and you have to try and take out some of that money.#Statement-opinion
You always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month#Statement-opinion
so, uh, long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because, uh, it's automatically taken out.#Statement-opinion
So, uh, that works out much better for us,#Statement-non-opinion
so that's kind of how we do it anyway#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
And the old, uh, if you can't see it, then you can't spend it, uh, idea#Statement-opinion
E-, exactly#Agree/Accept
and if you can't touch it, you can't spend it either.#Statement-opinion
So that kind of works out where you get into, uh, some plans that, you know, you touch it you're going to get a penalty, that kind of thing,#Statement-opinion
so it leads you to kind of say well I'm not going to take it out.#Statement-opinion
I'm going to keep it and, uh, keep it in there and let it grow so that someway, maybe for retirement you're going to have that money#Quotation
.#Non-verbal
left.#Other
Let's hope anyway,#Statement-opinion
so#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you'll have that#Other
so that's kind of how we do it.#Statement-non-opinion
But ours is more like month to month too, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
short term is, to get things going#Statement-non-opinion
so. Anyway, other than that, uh, is kind of how we do it#Statement-non-opinion
so. I don't#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
know if we're, our time is up or what#Other
Uh, they'll, uh#Uninterpretable
They'll let us know#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
exactly.#Statement-non-opinion
We, we actually do have some money in a Four Oh One K.#Statement-non-opinion
I just#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
wish I could afford to, uh, put more away each week because I agree that it's a, an excellent way,#Other
Oh, definitely,#Agree/Accept
definitely.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, it grows, uh,#Statement-opinion
it, it seems like at first you're not going to see a big return#Statement-opinion
but as the years go on, if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better#Statement-opinion
and, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
so, you know, you just have to kind of look at it that way#Other
and there's other savings plans or other things that you can do.#Statement-non-opinion
Automatic, you know, deposit from checks to where you don't see it.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, you know, exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's put into our savings account#Statement-non-opinion
and we don't see it,#Statement-non-opinion
then it works out to where, you know, you don't look at it,#Statement-opinion
you just look at the checking account,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and say this is what we have for money#Other
and that's it,#Statement-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be I'm convinced.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it, it's easy because you do spend it,#Statement-opinion
that's for sure.#Appreciation
Like I said, you know, you kind of look at it, uh,#Statement-opinion
you better have some other way of, uh, savings,#Statement-opinion
otherwise, uh, checking accounts aren't the best for, you know, long term type of planning,#Statement-opinion
so. And you don't get a good return on it anyway,#Statement-opinion
so, other,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I guess there, other than things like the stock market or mutual funds, there's really not much of a return on anything these days.#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Right now.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's a bad time, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
the interest is so low.#Statement-opinion
I mean it, it's nice for people buying homes#Statement-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for older people who have money#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in C D -s or whatever, it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever.#Other
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
You know, we have some in-laws, uh, that, uh, had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and, uh, kind of took them out of that because they got so low#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
it's, it drops#Statement-opinion
so your better bet is to, uh, try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of, uh, savings plans or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever so or some kind of profit sharing#Statement-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I'm, I'm with a small company now#Statement-non-opinion
and I hope that, uh, if we're successful that they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that'll be very nice.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's great,#Appreciation
yeah#Agree/Accept
Okay.#Uninterpretable
Well I guess we're kind of running out of steam on this topic here.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
exactly#Agree/Accept

Uh, basically I'm at home#Statement-non-opinion
and I have two cats#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my husband,#Other
I mean my husband's great.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's wonderful,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
and, and, uh, so I'm about forty and whatever,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Around there, huh.#Collaborative Completion
So, yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well, you're, you're just a youngster then#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm just a#Statement-non-opinion
I passed the fifty.#Statement-non-opinion
spring chicken, I guess#Other
So, I guess our topic's going to be changes in the women's roles,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
it should be real interesting.#Other
Righto#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you think we're ready?#Yes-No-Question
I think I'm ready#Affirmative non-yes answers
Okay#Response Acknowledgement
okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Uh, you want to start off?#Action-directive
Well, let's see,#Agree/Accept
the changes I've seen in women's roles, uh,#Hold before answer/agreement
since I am in the forty age, I'm a fifties baby#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh,#Other
and from my mother's generation to my generation it's just a very, very wide, uh, it's been a big change.#Statement-opinion
Very much, yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Very much,#Agree/Accept
and I think you'll have to agree#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and since we were in, uh, sort of the ground level, the bra burning of the sixties,#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh,#Other
and I think, you know, it got off to a really radical,#Statement-opinion
it has a radical fringe to it that, uh, I've sort of backed away from.#Statement-non-opinion
I think all things get started sometimes in that manner.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, they come in that way.#Statement-opinion
And, to make a change, you know, you have to make a splash.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, to continue in that vein, I think it got a little bit warped and off the track#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in several areas,#Other
but I really do think that women have made a contribution#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, to human beings, I mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions#Other
and it's okay#Statement-opinion
and I think, uh, you know on the other hand, I don't know that men have changed that much.#Statement-opinion
So in, in contrast to the women's changes, uh, you know, the men stay steady,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then the women change around them.#Statement-opinion
I hadn't thought much about that,#Statement-non-opinion
but that is true.#Appreciation
That,#Uninterpretable
Uh, I think men are trying.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Some of them.#Statement-opinion
But they don't have a national organization of men,#Statement-opinion
No.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to, uh, help them out#Other
and#Statement-opinion
No.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, what's changing them, though, is the economic situation,#Other
Uh-huh.#Other
where both#Other
Very much.#Appreciation
team, it has to be a team partnership now,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they both have to work#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they both have to raise the children,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if we're going to have any kind of future at all,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and that, I think has been the downfall of the last ten years.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, the me, oh,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
the, the yuppiedom,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the whatever it was, the, you know, women didn't know how to go about doing the careers#Other
and they wanted to compete with men,#Statement-opinion
they wanted to be like men,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's wrong.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men, men#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Not,#Uninterpretable
no,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they, they hurt themselves a little bit in that way.#Statement-opinion
Absolutely,#Agree/Accept
and so that's, you know,#Uninterpretable
they sort of threw the thing back another, you know, ten years,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that they've had to, you know, restructure,#Other
but I saw the greatest T-shirt the other day,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I got to get some for all my men friends,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
it says, let men run the world, women have more important things to do#Statement-non-opinion
There you go#Appreciation
There's a lot of truth in that.#Appreciation
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I think men and women both have valuable, valuable assets to offer#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, we shouldn't,#Uninterpretable
we were made differently,#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
however you come to that conclusion,#Other
we were biologically, physiologically, made differently#Statement-opinion
and there is great wonderment,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
in that,#Other
and, uh, you know, we should respect that in each other#Statement-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it shouldn't be destroyed.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and, you know, just sort of all s-, swooshed into one channel#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sort of thing,#Other
it's, it's viva la difference#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
someone said that#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I think that you can truly respect the other person,#Statement-opinion
I mean, you know, Tom is just always saying, what a mystery you are, you know you know.#Statement-opinion
Depends,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's kind of makes it exciting.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Other
Well that depends on what day of the month it is.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
But, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
I guess we've gotten more of a,#Statement-opinion
in, in terms of that, I think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and our roles,#Other
and, but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
I think now when both are working they have a more ch-, more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, that's, that's a very different way to do,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, the woman doesn't start off at home,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
raising the kids and goes back into her career, you know,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
twenty years later.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh,#Other
Because you get set in your ways#Statement-opinion
and it's,#Statement-opinion
You do.#Appreciation
really hard because to, to really to get help.#Other
Yeah.#Other
Uh, d-, you know to get the work load shared.#Other
Are, are you married?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
uh-huh.#Yes answers
Our,#Uninterpretable
Do you have children?#Yes-No-Question
I, we have five children,#Affirmative non-yes answers
they're#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
They're all grown and on their own#Other
so,#Uninterpretable
Oh, my.#Appreciation
They're, uh,#Uninterpretable
How did you do?#Open-Question
Uh, how do you mean that?#Open-Question
Well, I mean, okay,#Statement-non-opinion
well did you have boys, girls,#Open-Question
how did,#Uninterpretable
how,#Uninterpretable
Uh, we have, uh, two girls and three boys#Statement-non-opinion
and our,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my.#Appreciation
our baby girl just had a baby girl#Other
Oh, my.#Appreciation
Last week was her first baby.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how exiting.#Appreciation
So it's been real exciting.#Appreciation
I, I tell you what.#Appreciation
I don't know what I would do without my friends having all their kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just love the babies#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and since I'm sort of in a medical situation where I can't do that, it's,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Have you been that way long?#Yes-No-Question
Just eight years,#Negative non-no answers
just#Uninterpretable
Just eight years.#Repeat-phrase
the most important years of my life you know#Statement-non-opinion
That's, that's a long eight years, though.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it has been.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, so there have been major, major adjustments,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but that's another story.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, you know, my husband has really, really filled in the gaps,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean I,#Statement-non-opinion
That makes a big difference.#Statement-opinion
I couldn't ask for a better life.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean if this is the way it had to be,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this is the best way,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I could possibly do it#Other
and, and that has a lot to do with his strength and his, just pitching in and, and his being able to, you know, all, all ego aside, do a lot of things#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that really,#Other
so, when I say men haven't changed I guess I should look at my own backyard sort,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
of thing#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Well, probably your role#Statement-opinion
and, and the way you are also has changed, though.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Appreciation
You know, compared to what it would have been twenty, fifty years ago.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's true.#Appreciation
I mean, boy,#Appreciation
I mean I, I would have had so,#Statement-non-opinion
I had so much guilt to begin with#Statement-non-opinion
and the changes that had to take place, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where I couldn't do a lot of things#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, just adjusting to that,#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, uh, yeah, that was a major change,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but so, I guess uh, in the end, you know, you each take your own situation and you, and you deal with it the best you can,#Statement-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
The best you can, yeah.#Repeat-phrase
but, but women I think are a whole, you know sort of riding the course,#Other
they're, they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there,#Statement-opinion
I think the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation.#Statement-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's the only thing I worry about is the, the child's love and security.#Statement-non-opinion
That,#Uninterpretable
I think that's being damaged, uh,#Statement-opinion
I think,#Statement-opinion
a lot.#Other
we're going to see a generation of kids that, you know, are just going to be a little bit, uh, oh, not very nurturing.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think,#Uninterpretable
I do, too.#Agree/Accept
I, I think, uh,#Uninterpretable
now some, some women can, can do both.#Statement-opinion
They're very capable of working#Statement-opinion
and, and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I wish they weren't so many,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I wish they weren't role models for everybody,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because it's so dangerous.#Other
It, it really is, yeah.#Agree/Accept
It's dangerous for the woman, too, to think that she can do that#Statement-opinion
and then when she can't, you know, the failure of that is,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, her life sort of falls apart#Other
and she doesn't know who she is#Statement-opinion
and she's,#Uninterpretable
So many have to work to make a go of it, it seems,#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
or they say they do anyways,#Statement-non-opinion
and, but I think ones that don't have to, the,#Statement-opinion
it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there.#Statement-opinion
Well, you know, I think that's, that's really, I think it depends on what part of the country you're in.#Statement-opinion
Well, that could be.#Appreciation
Uh, I, I would almost just say that because, you know, down here in the south#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, a woman's role is,#Other
Uh.#Uninterpretable
a woman's role,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sort of thing,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you know,#Uninterpretable
You mean it's stronger there?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, oh, yeah,#Yes answers
yeah.#Yes answers
Much stronger.#Appreciation
And, and I think that, uh, you know, career women still have a lot of problems here,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with the good old boys,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
here in Texas sort of thing,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
making career moves#Other
but,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you know, in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents, uh, it's just like the way it, it has been for years.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you know, since the days of the pioneers, around here.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's the woman's role,#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Appreciation
and it, and it's hard for her to, uh, you know, watch her peers be appreciated, I think sometimes,#Statement-opinion
but then I'm not there,#Hedge
so I don't know that.#Hedge
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I have women that do both#Statement-non-opinion
and I see a little jealousy on the part of, you know, the woman what has two little boys#Statement-non-opinion
and, and she has an au pair, which is a live-in college kid working for her#Statement-non-opinion
and then she has her business in the back#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Uninterpretable
and then my other girlfriend that has, you know, just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
all the time.#Other
And so I see I little bit of that#Statement-non-opinion
and I always wish there was a balance, you know,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with the one and, and wish she could spend more time with her kids#Other
and the other gal I wish she could just get out of Dodge,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for a while#Other
But they're both,#Statement-non-opinion
Get some peace and quiet.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they're both different people, too.#Statement-non-opinion
That's,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
definitely,#Appreciation
so. You're right about that.#Agree/Accept
That's where the trouble lies.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Some people, some people can adjust and have both, do both well,#Statement-opinion
And that's,#Uninterpretable
and others can't.#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Appreciation
That's so true.#Appreciation
How, how did your daughter do it?#Open-Question
Uh, well, uh, I have one daughter that works full-time.#Statement-non-opinion
She has two little boys.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, they seem to do fine.#Statement-non-opinion
She has been talk-, has talked about quitting, you know, and staying home for a few years.#Statement-non-opinion
But then, it's real hard because she's got an excellent job.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh.#Uninterpretable

Okay.#Other
Um, what do you do this weekend?#Open-Question
Well, uh, pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh. Which is,#Uninterpretable
wh-, d-, what do you plan, have planned for your yard?#Open-Question
Well, uh, we just bought our house, uh, last July,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, it, it, the house is forty years old#Statement-non-opinion
so there's, there's an established lawn and whatnot, flower beds, things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
but they've, uh, they've gone a few years of neglect.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, we're in the process of, uh, revitalizing the whole situation.#Statement-non-opinion
We've got, um, different flower beds in front and, uh, a window box, a built in window box, um, trying to get some color back in those, get the trees trimmed up, uh, get rid of a few weed problems and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
What part of the state do you live in?#Wh-Question
Uh, I live in Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
My wife and I, we live in Dallas too,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just what that area,#Uninterpretable
we're planning on moving to Flower Mound,#Statement-non-opinion
and we're going to be getting some wheel h-,#Statement-non-opinion
we're going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Seems like it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, the place we've been living at, it's, uh, we're, we're just leasing it.#Statement-non-opinion
The, in Plano, and the soil has so much, has such a high clay content,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, uh, uh, I went to use my dad-in-law's tiller and it about for my arms off,#Other
I'll bet.#Appreciation
sockets#Other
I'll bet.#Appreciation
I mean just, just scratching two or three inches was just a chore.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
It was, it was#Statement-non-opinion
and then when it gets wet, you know, you don't even want to get out in the yard,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's horrible.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's a nightmare.#Statement-non-opinion
But, um, I don't know what, what i-,#Uninterpretable
um, where you live is there a real high, uh, alkaline or ash content#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Yes answers
it's pretty high alk-, w-,#Statement-non-opinion
ac-, actually it's done, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it's in the north end of Oak Cliff in, uh, Kessler Park area,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, we've got about,#Uninterpretable
I know right where that's at.#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we've, we've got mayb-, maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then it's solid rock from then on down,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Really.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
it's, uh, a little aggravating,#Statement-non-opinion
we can't, we can't put in anything too big, um, as far as, uh, shrubs and things like that because they've got to get a chance to find the, find the cracks in the rock.#Statement-non-opinion
Golly.#Appreciation
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Is it, is it limestone under, underneath?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
it is.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, it's solid limestone.#Statement-non-opinion
How do you put trees in there?#Open-Question
Uh, you just, we're just happy that there's trees already there so far,#Hold before answer/agreement
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, anything like that is, is a, uh, major undertaking I guess, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
sprinkler systems or anything, uh, start to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
and it, you know, no-, not even, consider, considering a pool or anything like that, that's, that's,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
practically has to be blasted in I guess.#Other
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
and it makes, it makes for a, a different challenge,#Statement-opinion
I've never,#Uninterpretable
well, I, I moved to Dallas about five years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I never really, messed with anything, uh, gardening or anything like that until now,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I, I keep hearing all the stories of, of different parts of town.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, uh, we even, we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the first thing the, the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said, uh, I've got, I've got a dozen different varieties#Statement-non-opinion
and each one works in one part of town#Quotation
and that's it,#Statement-non-opinion
That's basically what he was trying to tell us.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we, we tried planting tomatoes last year#Statement-non-opinion
and it, they, they turned out pretty poor.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just, I wi-, I just wish I'd known the, the variety and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it,#Uninterpretable
But it, it's amazing we also have roses,#Statement-non-opinion
and, I mean, they just grow so beautifully.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that wou-,#Uninterpretable
in fact, we put in some, uh, some more roses yesterday.#Statement-non-opinion
Like what, um, what type roses?#Wh-Question
Uh, different, uh, a few different, uh, hybrid tea type varieties.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, hybrid teas.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
we, we have a few, uh, of the real short stem.#Statement-non-opinion
They're kin-, they're kind of like the bush roses.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I don't know I think it's, I think it only has about five or six more years to go because it's a, it's a really old bush,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and but I, I, I'm amazed because the sun is so intense,#Statement-non-opinion
and the roses just seem to survive just fine there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's, we, that's what we're searching, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
we've got, we've got all the different lake editions around the house#Statement-non-opinion
and we're, we're kind of experimenting right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We do, we've got the direct sun in front#Statement-non-opinion
and the backyard has two great big, uh, spruce and, and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall#Statement-non-opinion
so the backyard is just complete dark all day long.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, we're we're struggling to find something for those areas.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Have you, have you, uh, done, um, done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not?#Or-Clause
No,#No answers
they're, they're in pretty good condition.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, we've been, we've been pretty lucky on that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just if you want a lot of, you know, light for underneath,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that may be the, all right because we had, because we have some, we have some old fruit trees.#Other
We have a plum that's just about ready to go,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so we may just be getting rid of that#Statement-non-opinion
but, but our peaches they, they seem to be doing just fine,#Statement-non-opinion
but they, they really need pruning.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It just seems like they, that, that even, you know, pruning once a year is really not enough#Statement-opinion
but the, the way they behave.#Uninterpretable
That's true.#Agree/Accept
That's true.#Agree/Accept
I don't know.#Hedge
But, uh, but, uh, what kind of, uh, what kind of, what kind of grass are you growing?#Wh-Question
It's, uh, bermuda.#Statement-non-opinion
Bermuda.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Repeat-phrase
Oh, I've, I've been trying, uh, uh, a mixture of, uh, the bermuda and the rye,#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I may be working like a fescue in because of, you know, the type of weather.#Statement-non-opinion
It seems that, uh, bermuda's, bermuda's fine#Statement-opinion
but, um, it looks like it would hold the soil#Statement-opinion
but it really doesn't.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A lot of, a lot silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, but the rye does really well. Especially during the wintertime.#Statement-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, but, boy, once it gets over seventy, seventy-five degrees that, it just dries up,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
shrivels up and dies.#Other
But anyway.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
there's such a, there's such a difference,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
through the year. Uh,#Other
My, my parents-in-law they're, they're building a house into the side of a hill, um,#Statement-non-opinion
well, it's already been built and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They've been living there for about three months now,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, this is out in west Texas,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but the, the wind there, has been so bad that, I mean, they've tried to plant grass#Statement-non-opinion
and they just, have some problems,#Statement-non-opinion
that's it .#Appreciation
big time problems#Other
they just,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so they just washing , uh, watching their lawn just blow away.#Other
.#Non-verbal
But it's, it's quite an undertaking.#Statement-non-opinion
They have about two or three acres of land on lake front property,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
on a, on the side of a hill.#Other
It's beautiful,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you can see the house from, you know, miles away,#Other
but it's, you know, it's a pretty neat little job#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they save a lot of, they save a lot of energy#Other
but just, uh, you know, for them, I mean, they, they're going to have to start gardening.#Statement-opinion
It's going to be from the ground up.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The whole way.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they said, well, we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just, getting this property developed.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
It's amazing,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they have, have the, all they have are me-, uh, mesquite and cottonwoods,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, it's, it's all on Lake Greenbelt ,#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that property out there.#Other
And, uh, I don't know, that what they have,#Statement-non-opinion
they have all the water they want,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they can, they can actually, they can pump water,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, they have to get permission#Statement-non-opinion
but they can pump water up from the shore,#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, that's for like an additional,#Statement-non-opinion
they have to pay like some kind of fee per year.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, they're, uh, right now though I think they're just, they're trying to get the trees planted and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, man, I, I just think of all of the money that they, that they're going to have to spend just getting that.#Statement-non-opinion
But the taxes alone there, Lake Greenbelt#Statement-non-opinion
and some places, they, they, they really nail them for tax.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, I mean, your talking what, just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
It's, it's ridiculous.#Statement-opinion
That really is,#Agree/Accept
it, it would,#Uninterpretable
it seem like it be just the opposite when you get,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No,#Reject
no,#Reject
it's not it's,#Reject
because even though it's far out there, it's just that Lake Greenbelt , you know, they have to, they, they try to do it just from the, selling the water.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um, the water usage, you know, they try to limit, even though there's three or four streams that flow into it, people still use it enough in, like in towns like Clarendon and other areas that, where they irrigate.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They they, they still haven't gotten used to the dry land farming#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true that,#Agree/Accept
the ir-, irrigation because it's gotten so bad the past few years,#Other
but I don't know#Hedge
I just came back from there#Statement-non-opinion
and just the air is so dry.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't see how anything can survive out there,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
for long periods of time.#Other
Should say#Uninterpretable
my father-in-law says the mesquite trees are, they're, they're pretty smart,#Statement-non-opinion
they're smart,#Statement-non-opinion
they're about the smartest tree around.#Statement-non-opinion
They don't, they don't even start growing until May,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
May or April, like after it's been raining for a few months.#Other
That's true.#Agree/Accept
They say the roots have developed#Statement-non-opinion
so that's all they work on.#Statement-non-opinion
Just a leafy,#Uninterpretable
they don't do anything.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's something I've been, uh, been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at this time of the year#Other
and, you know, we're trying to decide what, what to, what to put on one side of the house and things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
but there's so many things that they, they last for just a couple of weeks#Statement-non-opinion
and then it, then it's just a, a bush there from then on.#Statement-non-opinion
It's kind of, it's kind of disappointing.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I don't know#Hedge
my, my wife and I, we planted on the, on the south side of our, of our house we planted some gardenias.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they did real fine during the summertime#Statement-non-opinion
it's just,#Uninterpretable
but during the fall when it stopped, when, uh, the rain let off just a little bit it, I mean, it just dried up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, so I guess, it, these plants they just, they don't,#Uninterpretable
it's like they remain ...#Uninterpretable

So, what do you think about it?#Open-Question
Well, I found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said, well, if there is a problem,#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what should we do about it?#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess that's so.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you feel there's a problem with immigration in America?#Yes-No-Question
Um, uh, I think there's some problems,#Affirmative non-yes answers
but they're not really big ones.#Statement-opinion
I think that, um, in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be.#Statement-opinion
That it's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here even if they're educated and will be a good asset to America.#Statement-opinion
It's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that.#Statement-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
That's interesting.#Appreciation
I was, I was wondering what your response would be.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm a first generation American.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I'm,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, where did you come from?#Wh-Question
from immigrant parents#Other
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or an immigrant mother anyway.#Other
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so where did your parents come from?#Wh-Question
Uh, Poland.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
And,#Uninterpretable
And that was, you know, prior to World War Two.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it's interesting that, you know, with the topic I think I agree with you.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There needs to be more of an open policy.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you know we have to remember the Chinese came here and were our labor, you know, for the railroad, Transatlantic Railroad#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Yep.#Agree/Accept
our Irish came and, you know, built the towns and,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
did labor.#Other
But what do you think,#Wh-Question
are you from Texas#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
I'm from Pennsylvania.#Negative non-no answers
Pennsylvania.#Response Acknowledgement
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, that will be interesting.#Appreciation
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Because we have just,#Statement-non-opinion
a lot of,#Other
had a Naturalization Act where the Mexicans that were residents in Texas, I'm from Texas#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and have become citizens now.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What do you think about that?#Open-Question
Um, I think that's all right.#Statement-opinion
I, um,#Uninterpretable
at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing.#Statement-opinion
Do you have an opinion about it?#Yes-No-Question
Well, I agree with it wholeheartedly.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The only thing is I've got to share with you, my background is from New Jersey.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, when you were giving your answer I was thinking, is this a Texan I'm talking to?#Statement-non-opinion
No,#No answers
okay.#Uninterpretable
Because Texan philosophy is a little different.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Well, a lot of the experience that I have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who's Chinese and immigrated from China.#Statement-non-opinion
And, um, you know he, um, got a green card is, and is in good standing in America and China, but only because he was always nice to the Chinese government,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and all that,#Other
and he was always on pretty good terms with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well we,#Uninterpretable
But, um, their,#Uninterpretable
my sister just had a baby#Statement-non-opinion
and they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to America to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
And it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem.#Statement-non-opinion
It's just very difficult to get a woman who doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily to visit here.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, then you have first in the experience on immigration.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Well, that is interesting.#Appreciation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I wonder, you know, even with those that were involved with Tienamen's Square.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, did we really protect them?#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's, and I think that's pretty crazy,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I mean those students who were in America when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back,#Other
and aside for that, they're the best and brightest of China#Statement-opinion
so it's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can.#Statement-opinion
That is true.#Agree/Accept
That is true.#Agree/Accept
Well, what do you think about,#Open-Question
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we have in Texas a large Vietnamese population#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that has been brought in.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What do you think about that?#Open-Question
Um,#Hold before answer/agreement
And these are not the brightest.#Statement-non-opinion
See, these are refujees, you mean?#Yes-No-Question
I mean we#Dispreferred answers
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
we're talking boat people.#Other
Right,#Response Acknowledgement
okay.#Response Acknowledgement
We have a lot of boat people in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion

Well, um, I don't have any problem with that. Um,#Statement-non-opinion
You're a true liberal heart-to-heart.#Statement-opinion
Good for you.#Appreciation

I guess so#Agree/Accept
I was ready for a fight on this one#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No,#No answers
I agree because,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, interesting, my, when my daughter was in high school, one of the custodians was Vietnamese#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I understand the topic this morning is, uh, our policy in Latin America and, you know, what we've been doing down there.#Statement-non-opinion
So, uh, as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area#Summarize/reformulate
it, it just so happens that, uh, our daughter-in-law is Panamanian,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we have been in Panama#Statement-non-opinion
and I have worked in El Salvador#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we visit Mexico occasionally,#Statement-non-opinion
so, yeah,#Uninterpretable
we, we do have a little information on it here,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
Oh, very good,#Appreciation
because actually, um, when I was in college I visited Mexico several times,#Statement-non-opinion
I was in the Peace Corps and, um,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Peru,#Other
but, but recently I have been following the Middle East rather than,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Central America#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit#Statement-opinion
that's, that's for sure.#Appreciation
No,#No answers
I,#Uninterpretable
the U S policy, uh, towards Central America as far as, uh,#Uninterpretable
well, I kind of go back to, to the El Salvador thing because Texas Instruments had a, a plant down there for a while,#Statement-non-opinion
and I worked in there for a little while,#Statement-non-opinion
and at that particular time,#Statement-non-opinion
let's, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
that was seventy-three, seventy-four kind of before the, the, uh, the Civil War really picked up down there,#Statement-non-opinion
and U S policy at that particular time there was, of course, military assistance to, uh, to the government itself, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
anything that's, that's anti-Communist, you know, we kind of had a tendency to be pro#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It don't matter what their excesses were,#Statement-non-opinion
and I believe at the time that I was down there, that, uh, the government, uh, the Salvadorian government you know, really gotten out of hand yet,#Statement-non-opinion
the, uh, right wing death squad type situation#Statement-non-opinion
I believe that, that was beginning to form#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't, I, I wasn't really aware of it's being, you know, terribly, uh, you know, at the time that, that I was down there,#Statement-non-opinion
I think that really kind of developed a little bit later on,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, our policies seem to be pretty much one of, uh, you know, trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource, anyway, that Salvador had,#Statement-non-opinion
plenty of and that was people.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's, it's labor,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because everything that T I did anyway we, we shipped in#Statement-non-opinion
and it was worked on down there, assembled, and then sent back here,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
did that have,#Yes-No-Question
I didn't feel that we really ex-, exploiting them any.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, so, you don't, you don't feel that, that we were, um, exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting#Summarize/reformulate
and they weren't.#Summarize/reformulate
No, uh,#Agree/Accept
in the particular incidence that I was aware of, now T I wasn't the only ones in there,#Statement-non-opinion
Playtex was in,#Statement-non-opinion
there was, uh, several other companies,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, of course, we kind of concentrate on ,#Statement-opinion
there wasn't much to take out of the country#Statement-non-opinion
I felt like we're going in and taken all their, um, their gold or oil,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or bananas or coffee or anything like that,#Other
because, uh, it just,#Uninterpretable
the only thing that they had a great abundance of was, uh, you know, human beings#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Di-, did we tend to, um, change their attitu-, attitudes#Yes-No-Question
like sometimes when Americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt American things, Americanism, um, consumer products, T V, the whole works.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I understand what you say.#Appreciation
There was a, uh,#Uninterpretable
the time that I was down there, I stayed quite a, a bit at the, uh, uh, one of the big hotels San Salvador.#Statement-non-opinion
And at the time I thought there ought to be a law against American tourists. Because they, for the most part, tend to be the most obnoxious as a, as a group,#Statement-non-opinion
and I saw this in Panama also,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, oh, you know, it's, it's the, uh, the almost stereotype, you know,#Statement-opinion
flowery shirt, shorts, camera hanging around their neck, you know, demanding this, that and the other thing, you know,#Statement-opinion
we're, we're here,#Quotation
and we want this,#Quotation
and we want that,#Quotation
and that sort of thing,#Statement-non-opinion
that's, that's the stereotype that's very strong down there, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
the, the, the, you know, that sort of thing,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I, I believe those of us who were working down there, got a little bit more appreciation for, you know, the local, uh, culture#Statement-non-opinion
I really don't believe that we were quite that bad,#Statement-non-opinion
but yet they were having to deal directly with, uh, you know, with the, uh, the local people.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, but boy#Appreciation
there is a, there is a bad, uh, uh, you know, the old brash or ugly American-type,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
situation.#Other
And I saw incidences in the hotel where I just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say, oh, my God#Statement-non-opinion
those are, those are not Americans#Quotation
they can't be.#Quotation
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But there are#Quotation
and, uh, of course, now I, I do have to, I remember one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad,#Statement-non-opinion
but I mean, it, I think it's just kind of the North American situation .#Statement-non-opinion
In Panama they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long#Statement-non-opinion
but I didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing, as Panamanians are just about as as, uh, as as Americans, as far as, uh, creature comforts, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
they're, uh, they're, they're every bit, uh,#Uninterpretable
I, I know, when, my, my son was in the Air Force#Statement-non-opinion
and he was stationed in Panama,#Statement-non-opinion
and he married a Panamanian girl,#Statement-non-opinion
and when she came up here, uh, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
she's, y-, kn-, except for the language situation, some of the cultures she's just about an American,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, is as far as T V and, and, you know, the, the moneymaking part of it and all that,#Other
matter of fact if anything, she's worse.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, uh, it, it just, there's little enclaves down there where, you know, Americans have a lot of influence#Statement-non-opinion
and the local population kind of, um, you know, sort of accepts that,#Statement-non-opinion
but I've also seen the other side of it, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you were in Peru?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I was in Peru,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, I, there weren't, as I recall, or at least I wasn't aware of that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this was when the Peace Corps first are started,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it was one of the big targets#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, I don't, I don't think, at that time, at least, Peace Corps was, uh, an obnoxious group in the sense that, that we were very controlled regarding number of days off#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you couldn't just, take up, take off and leave your group and go explore and, and things like that,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, and I was working actually in the savings and loan program,#Statement-non-opinion
so, that was quite specialized,#Statement-non-opinion
although I was living in the slums, I was really working with the middle class.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What, uh, what area did you live in?#Wh-Question
I was up in Arequipa .#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay#Response Acknowledgement
yeah.#Uninterpretable
And, um#Uninterpretable
I've heard of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so.#Uninterpretable
Well, is, are they, is Peace Corps still active down in there?#Yes-No-Question
I don't have any idea, um,#Other answers
probably not,#Negative non-no answers
I mean, there were thir-, I was, uh, Per-, Peru thirteen, which meant there were twelve groups before mine,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that had gone in#Other
and, and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development,#Statement-non-opinion
and they were building schools and doing co-ops and things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
health, um, inoculation and, and things.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, has those influences lasted#Yes-No-Question
do you know whether the, the things that, that you and your groups before you did, did those, did those live on#Yes-No-Question
or were they reabsorbed#Or-Clause
or how,#Uninterpretable
No,#No answers
no,#No answers
I believe they did#Statement-non-opinion
because, um, some of, some of the, the Peace Corps, uh, that I knew of, did marry Peruvians,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and have been back#Other
and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things,#Statement-non-opinion
and of course, the savings and loan program, um, that was, that, you know, that, that just continued to grow.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, after my group,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, we were just a very small specialized group, too, to get that going and spread#Statement-non-opinion
and then, of course, Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's, uh, uh, something that nationalized very quickly.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the same with the co-ops.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's, that was kind of the, the aim wasn't it, to get it started and then have it,#Summarize/reformulate
Right.#Agree/Accept
taken up by the,#Other
oh, okay,#Uninterpretable
o-, so, you know, well, that's,#Uninterpretable
I had wondered sometimes,#Statement-non-opinion
I knew that there was a lot of, a lot of effort#Statement-non-opinion
and a lot of work went into a lot of that,#Statement-opinion
and I just wondered if, if it lasted, and if it took, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
like,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, r-,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've, you know, some of the programs I would have concern about like, um, the language teaching, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, why should we push English,#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a lot of people were down there teaching English#Statement-non-opinion
and when they talked about Hungary or someplace, one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach language, you know, to me that's a little bit marginal.#Statement-non-opinion
I did teach economics at the university one night a week,#Statement-non-opinion
and the textbook was in English,#Statement-non-opinion
but basically I taught it in Spanish,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because, I mean, I really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
my brother-in-law teaches at, uh, Northern Illinois University#Statement-non-opinion
and they were in China, here a couple of years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
and he was over there at, uh, the University of Shah and, and teaching ...#Statement-non-opinion

Hi.#Conventional-opening
Hi,#Conventional-opening
I'm Carol,#Conventional-opening
and I'm calling from Garland, Texas.#Conventional-opening
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this is#Conventional-opening
I'm in Dallas.#Conventional-opening
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Because yesterday I talked to someone upstate, I'm not even sure where,#Statement-non-opinion
and my husband talked to the people in Utah,#Statement-non-opinion
so. Um, anyway, let me press one.#Offers, Options Commits
Okay#Agree/Accept
Okay, um,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
let me see, I think we've only planned one family reunion in our life,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
I.#Uninterpretable
we don't do this too often.#Other
Um, most of my family's in California,#Statement-non-opinion
but my husband's is in San Antonio,#Statement-non-opinion
and so we did this in San Antonio,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, it was an experience that I, I won't do again#Statement-non-opinion
How big a family do you have?#Wh-Question
Um, well, it wasn't that big of a family,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, it just got out of hand,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and, and, um, how much, um, beverages we were going to need and this and that,#Statement-non-opinion
and oh, it just grew and grew and grew,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, when the time came, only about half that amount of people came.#Statement-non-opinion
So, it wasn't, you know,#Uninterpretable
you have to really just get an accurate amount,#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
but overall we all had a good time.#Statement-non-opinion
We saw people we hadn't see in a while#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Did you have people coming from far away?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
It was all in the San Antonio area#Statement-non-opinion
Well sometimes.#Uninterpretable
But it, it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing,#Statement-non-opinion
and we're going, Oh, my gosh.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Well you have, you have#Statement-opinion
the family lives too close together, they see each other too often#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
basically.#Agree/Accept
they don't take that kind of thing seriously.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And if, uh#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, they come from far away, it's, uh, it, it, they take it more seriously#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
I think you're right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My family's not very big#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, we're kind of.#Statement-non-opinion
Your family's from where?#Declarative Wh-Question
Well, I have a, a, a brother lives in Indianapolis, a sister lives in Chicago, and my folks live back in Buffalo, New York.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
Uh, I guess we have reunions about once a year or so.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We got together over Christmas.#Statement-non-opinion
My wife's family, they're, they're all in,#Statement-non-opinion
most of them are in upstate New York.#Statement-non-opinion
They have regular, uh, regular family reunions every summer.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, those are nice.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'm, I'm sure they're a lot more organized too, because they've done it before.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and it's, it's just something that they, they plan on doing every summer.#Statement-non-opinion
They just have#Statement-non-opinion
That's great.#Appreciation
a weekend picnic,#Other
and every year everyone asks#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when is it happening and where is it happening#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they just plan on being here.#Statement-non-opinion
That makes a big difference, too.#Statement-opinion
I know everybody's real eager to participate.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
well that's great.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they, they had a family reunion for, uh, well, for my mother-in-law at her seventy-fifth birthday,#Statement-non-opinion
and they managed to get just about everybody, everybody into town, uh, last November#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
including a number of people from out in California.#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it was a, it was good, it, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it worked out very well.#Other
One in-, interesting thing that they did at the time is they, um, they videotaped the, the whole shebang#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which, it made a nice remembrance of, of the entire party.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
more people want to come back again.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they want to come back.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's good.#Appreciation
So, so that, that works pretty well that way.#Statement-non-opinion
My, uh, my grandmother in California is, um,#Statement-non-opinion
this is my dad's part, side of the family is planning a reunion, um, this spring,#Statement-non-opinion
but we won't be going because, um, I don't know how they thought of this, it's going to be on a cruise,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, it seems like most of the family is, uh, going, you know, all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are, most of them are going,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's too costly for us.#Statement-non-opinion
But anyway, they're going to go on a cruise,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, it sounds really neat, it really does.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I can go for that.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
What,#Uninterpretable
what do,#Uninterpretable
I guess interesting if you had a, a, a very extended family that, that kind of involved a lot of people that#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
cousins and things that you don't really know, that you've never met, it'd be interesting to meet a lot of those people.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I don't know how you would go about, uh, getting them together,#Statement-non-opinion
but that, that would be, uh.#Statement-opinion
And a friend of mine, um, she plans her family reunion, um, every year,#Statement-non-opinion
and they go camping,#Statement-non-opinion
and she says they have the greatest time,#Statement-non-opinion
and she says, usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person,#Statement-non-opinion
but she said they all go camping,#Statement-non-opinion
and they have a really good for the whole weekend.#Statement-non-opinion
So, that's.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I kind of wonder what, what kind of tradition we're going to establish for our family.#Statement-non-opinion
I had hoped that our, our kids get together at least regularly.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right now we only have two children#Statement-non-opinion
so I,#Uninterpretable
