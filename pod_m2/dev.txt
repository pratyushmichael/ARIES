Well, have you seen a new movie lately?#Yes-No-Question
Well, uh, I am a student#Statement-non-opinion
and I have, uh, been actually watching more movies on video,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than being able to go out to see, uh, movies at the store, or at the theater.#Other
Uh, I st-, I want to see the FISHER KING and, and, uh, catch ROBIN HOOD.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, uh, I haven't seen either one of those.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, what, what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though?#Wh-Question
Uh, let's see.#Hold before answer/agreement
Uh, I'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, WHITE PALACE which I thought was over rated, over hyped, um, recently.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you're catching me at, it, uh, uh, at mind's end here.#Statement-non-opinion
What have you seen recently?#Wh-Question
Well, maybe you, uh, you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What did you think of that one?#Open-Question
Enjoyed that quite a bit.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Um, I thought the, uh, the cima-, the cinematography was excellent.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, the story was,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, though it tended to be a little one sided#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, it was good.#Other
Uh, it was, it was believable.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh, I just moved down, in fact, from South Dakota in, in June,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's when the movie was filmed,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, we, when, when the movie came out, we went,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, my dad lives in the state capital, which is Pierre#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it was filmed right outside of Pierre.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, the buffalo, the scene, the big buffalo herd scene, that was, that was a live scene.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
Uh, there's a guy that has got a, a buffalo farm,#Statement-non-opinion
and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and, and, uh, we, my dad has got a little plane, we flew over it all a-, looked at the buffalo,#Statement-non-opinion
it was really neat.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, so we are watching the, the movie in the movie theater in Pierre#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, just every time I would start to get into the movie, and it was getting good#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
someone in the crowd would yell, hey, there's John Red Eagle, you know#Other
or,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know, they'd start recognizing people.#Other
They knew, they knew the extras or the,#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
So, I kind of, I think I enjoyed it more when I, when I watched it on video cassette than I did, uh, in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that.#Statement-non-opinion
I'd go now, now which one could that be#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
and I'd, I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of, of picking up the overall,#Statement-non-opinion
Scope.#Collaborative Completion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, but I, I thought it was a good film.#Statement-non-opinion
But you are right,#Statement-opinion
I think, I think it was very one sided.#Statement-opinion
It, it was,#Statement-opinion
but it's a side that hasn't been told. Uh, as far as, you know, telling it from, you know, the Indians as the good guys and the, the white men as the bad guys.#Statement-opinion
I, I really thought about, uh, all the, the westerns that we have seen for years and years,#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's just, shoot the Indians,#Statement-non-opinion
and they are always the savages.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
In fact, I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
it was a similar, uh, situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking a, an army fort.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, but it was an interesting movie.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, have you seen PRETTY WOMAN?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Now I thought that was a good show.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
That was, that was a good movie.#Statement-opinion
Um, it was just kind of a get away movie.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Kind of,#Uninterpretable
It didn't, uh, it didn't have any real social bearing#Statement-opinion
or,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
uh, and it wasn't really a comedy,#Other
but it was an enjoyable movie.#Statement-non-opinion
It was, it was kind of like the STAR WARS#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
s-, series, you know, just something a little different,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yet believable.#Other
Yes.#Agree/Accept
You're bringing it,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
I had a, I sure did have a mind lock about the movies I've seen.#Statement-non-opinion
But, yeah,#Uninterpretable
I've seen PRETTY WOMAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Uh, now are you, are you going to see, or do you, are you much of a STAR TREK fan,#Yes-No-Question
are you going to see this next one that's coming out?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, definitely.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Have you seen the rest?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
I think I've missed one.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not sure,#Hedge
but I think I've missed one.#Statement-non-opinion
I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago,#Statement-non-opinion
and they showed all five in a row.#Statement-non-opinion
Was that here in Dallas?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, they had it everywhere,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, every major city had one theater that did it#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because we had one here in Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
and they did it in Houston,#Statement-non-opinion
they did it, well, they did it everywhere.#Statement-non-opinion
And it was, it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed,#Statement-non-opinion
and the thing that I didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row, uh, time wise they happen one after another#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and just no, no time between them,#Other
but you can watch the characters develop,#Statement-opinion

Anyway, what are your, what are your first comments on that subject?#Wh-Question
Uh, my first comments on the budget.#Repeat-phrase
I would say there has,#Statement-non-opinion
What would you start cutting f-,#Wh-Question
what would be the first thing you'd cut?#Wh-Question
Defense?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Surprisingly, no.#No answers
I would, I would cut the prison systems and let them self-support.#Statement-non-opinion
Mean private enterprise?#Yes-No-Question
Huh?#Signal-non-understanding
Have private enter-, enterprise do it?#Yes-No-Question
You mean the prisons?#Signal-non-understanding
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
They're already talking about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, they're talking about, uh, having it, uh, as a, you know, business. Uh, to, uh, you know, to, so, the, you know, the government doesn't have to deal with it.#Statement-non-opinion
I hadn't heard that.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I think it's all funded, either state or federally funded#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or, uh, obviously.#Other
So, but, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
But to me it,#Statement-non-opinion
But see they're, they don't have enough, uh, uh, you know, there's, there's not enough room in these prisons and that, and that, uh, to continue funding it.#Other
They think they need to, maybe have, uh, you know, private, you know, business, private enterprise come in.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Well, see the other way I'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting, like, uh, the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons. Anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves.#Statement-opinion
In other words, they're in there for a purpose,#Statement-opinion
put them to work#Action-directive
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
rather than sitting there.#Other
It's the same thing like the whole criminal, I shouldn't say criminal, but the whole police department of the United States.#Statement-opinion
I feel the same way.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, someone gets picked up for drunk driving,#Statement-opinion
he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's self defen-, you know, self-defense on that point.#Statement-opinion
Uh, as far as my defense budget, uh, they're cutting it back now, what, twenty-five percent?#Rhetorical-Questions
I wouldn't want to see it cut any more than that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But again I'd like to see something on the other end back into education. But not in the education we have today.#Statement-non-opinion
So I'm lost on that one.#Statement-non-opinion
I would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems. And to come up with something a little better than what we've got.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
its tough to, to say what, uh, you know, what, uh,#Statement-opinion
as far as this, that good or bad or what.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, I was just talking to somebody else,#Statement-non-opinion
and all those European countries, they pay all the way through college and stuff like that.#Statement-non-opinion
They,#Uninterpretable
so, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, not so much pay.#Reject
I'm not trying to see the government put out any more.#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I know what you are saying.#Statement-non-opinion
But I'm just saying that even the differences, uh, is that, you know, some countries pay for students to go to, through college and etcetera.#Statement-non-opinion
But here, it, you know, it's just up to high school.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But see, we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college. To go either as an apprentice, which they, they do in other countries. Just doing it, which I think would bring the education back up. You know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
why not an apprentice out to a, a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or, you know, just a technician?#Rhetorical-Questions
You can learn on the job.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which, of course, again, which m-, would mean, again,#Other
our education budget will go down if this is,#Statement-opinion
in a few years, I mean it's not going to be overnight.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But that would come down.#Statement-opinion
I think the pro-, you know, that's one reason, uh, you know, we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board. Uh,#Statement-opinion
they're not willing to, you know, to put that, you know,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
the training for only a certain amount.#Other
So, uh, it's, you know, as far as the technical side.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, even like#Uninterpretable
one, one of the biggest things now is like paralegals and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean they, they're trying to get more people into that field.#Statement-non-opinion
But they can't just bring somebody in without even having gone to, you know, school in that area before they can work, you know, for a lawyer as a paralegal.#Statement-opinion
Excuse me. I see it being done#Statement-non-opinion
I know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever#Statement-non-opinion
and she's training her.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I'm, well ya-, I, you know, I'm assuming that it can be done. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
my perspective is that, you know, I've been with a couple of big companies now.#Statement-non-opinion
And it's like they'd, are unwilling to put the time in.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, they want somebody, you know, when they then, when they bring them off, bring them in, that they have something, you know, a certain amount to contribute.#Statement-non-opinion
Obviously, there's, uh, you know, there's a lot to learn, uh, after that.#Statement-non-opinion
But, but, uh, that's true.#Statement-opinion
I'm, I'm sure there's a lot of, uh,#Statement-opinion
you know, businesses are small, you know, small businesses that could, uh.#Statement-non-opinion
Let me change my channel,#Offers, Options Commits
I've got a cordless phone.#Statement-non-opinion
Let me see if that clears this up.#Offers, Options Commits
Is that better?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Wow!#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was a cordless phone,#Statement-non-opinion
and all of a sudden we had a bad, uh, frequency there or something.#Statement-non-opinion
So we had some interference,#Statement-non-opinion
so I changed that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere#Statement-non-opinion
Anyway, so, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well,#Uninterpretable
but, uh, you know, I think, uh, they, maybe they need to, uh, help promote that more. Give incentives like, uh, if they do bring somebody on, they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is, you know, for them to train people,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, stuff like that. Programs like that, you know.#Other
I don't know, you know, what kind of options they've got.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's something about what Germany's supposed to be doing. Something similar to that right now.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, they have jobs out on, you know, bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields.#Statement-non-opinion
But see, that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people. At people, per, at high school level,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which I would like to see. Rather than so many kids getting out of school.#Other
They're, they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because they don't have any education.#Other
I don't mean college.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'm for college.#Statement-non-opinion
But there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote, quote college is concerned.#Statement-opinion
They've had it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think, I just heard something the other day,#Statement-non-opinion
it was like only, it was either sixty percent or forty percent, go to college.#Statement-non-opinion
And then out of that percentage, only so many can get their degree.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I thought that was interesting.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, you know, most people I knew have gone and got their degree.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
But there's a lot of them out there that haven't.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I ju-, you know, I,#Statement-non-opinion
That's,#Uninterpretable
uh, was basic, in a, you know, middle, upper middle class area,#Other
and yeah,#Uninterpretable
so I think, uh, that demographic area there, you know, a lot of them do go on.#Statement-non-opinion
And they go to college, etcetera.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, it seems to me that kids that a-, get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it, usually are your drop outs. Where if they're said, hey, it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like. *#Statement-opinion
Because you can get just as far as being a journeyman, carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that. Make as much money#Statement-opinion
and if they enjoy it more, they'll make a lo-, happier life for themselves.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Question.#Other
You threw that question on me about the deficit,#Statement-non-opinion
put it on your shoe now.#Action-directive
What would you do?#Wh-Question
Well, as as far as the, you know, the deficit, that's a whole nother, uh, my perception of the budget, you know, the government.#Statement-non-opinion
And they have so much to spend#Statement-non-opinion
and there's not enough money to spread around.#Statement-opinion
But the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries, and that we have more money or goo-, you know, more money going out and too many goods coming into this country, you know.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, you know, part of that problem, I think, is still, you know, uh,#Statement-opinion
like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country.#Statement-opinion
And, and obviously the, the demand for their goods is quite high here,#Statement-opinion
so they can get their goods in here.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, you know, to start even that out we need to continue to, you know, at least threaten that, you know,#Statement-opinion
we're going to give them higher tariffs, etcetera to raise their prices to, you know, ours.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, it's just that, uh, they're, eh,#Statement-opinion
I think you're, you're going to find that just because the United States, you know, there is such a demand here, the market, you know.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, uh, the mone-, you know, money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell, you know, we don't, uh, sell products abroad as much as we bring in.#Statement-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Were you watching,#Yes-No-Question
I think, uh,#Uninterpretable
one of the news stations. I couldn't even tell you which one I watched. But they had on there, where the, the output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Jeri?#Other
Yes.#Yes answers
We're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done with it.#Statement-non-opinion
That's a rather, rather broad topic#Statement-opinion
They're usually pretty broad anyway.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Where do you live?#Wh-Question
Uh, we live in Plano.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
so, that's a,#Uninterpretable
Uh, and where you are?#Wh-Question
I'm in Richardson,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing down at, uh, Maceo High School#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in Dallas.#Other
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that is so frightening.#Appreciation
It is, you know,#Agree/Accept
Uh, do you have children in school?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
mine are already in college now,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't have to,#Other
at least when they were in high school, it was beginning but not like the rampages.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I have,#Uninterpretable
my oldest is his first year in high school#Statement-non-opinion
so we have all this to, to look forward to,#Statement-non-opinion
and it is really frightening, uh, to think that you can't even send them to school in safety.#Statement-opinion
I mean, certainly, you know, you can't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas,#Statement-opinion
but, you know, when you can't even, send them on their normal activities in safety, it, it's really frightening.#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, I really, you know,#Uninterpretable
they're coming down on the principal,#Statement-non-opinion
but I really don't know what they can do.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it's just in so much of society with the violence#Statement-opinion
and the kids having access to weapons and drugs#Statement-opinion
and I, I really don't know what, what can be done.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I just, I just don't understand how, of course, in my little world, how guns could be so available.#Statement-non-opinion
Well I don't either,#Statement-non-opinion
but apparently they just really are.#Statement-opinion
Uh I mean, to me, in Plano you would think that would be about, you know, about as innocent as you could get for for being in a, a large area.#Statement-opinion
But, you know, my son comes home and tells me that, you know, he hears kids talk about having guns#Statement-non-opinion
and uh, someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my heavens.#Appreciation
And, I mean, it just scared me to death#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, they called the police#Statement-non-opinion
and, and nothing happened,#Statement-non-opinion
but my goodness you know, it, it could have easily.#Statement-opinion
Well, maybe that's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution.#Statement-opinion
Maybe so.#Agree/Accept
You know, because I don't,#Uninterpretable
now I, somehow I feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen, you know, across the street, or seeing someone get mugged, or unfortunately, raped,#Statement-opinion
and people don't do anything.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A woman was raped in Richardson, I read in the paper oh, about a two weeks ago now.#Statement-non-opinion
And all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
But nobody, nobody did anything.#Statement-non-opinion
I just can't imagine that.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I mean they heard someone calling for help.#Statement-non-opinion
Nobody even called the police to say, you know, I hear a strange screaming#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm afraid, you know, if you,#Uninterpretable
I don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
well, I can see, you know, especially if you heard screams from a house or something, not going over there maybe, because, you know, it could be dangerous,#Statement-opinion
but certainly I can't understand not calling the police.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
I just, you know,#Uninterpretable
it's, it's really frightening that we're not, we're trying to live in our own little cocoons#Statement-opinion
and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Well I, I think you're right there.#Agree/Accept
I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business,#Statement-opinion
but I think that's real dangerous#Statement-opinion
and, uh, I don't know.#Hedge
I try to tell my kids just, just kind of be aware of what's around them, you know#Statement-non-opinion
and if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble, just get out of it or call for help, whichever.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, you know, the call for help is what scares me now because it, it just,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
people just don't,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
I can't say they don't care, because people just have to care about another person.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it's that not getting involved, that impersonal society, I think we live in today.#Statement-opinion
Well, maybe this thing with with the child at school, maybe that will make people think a bit more and, you know, take some steps to, to correct it.#Statement-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
it's, it really is, is frightening.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, uh,#Uninterpretable
Let me ask you,#Offers, Options Commits
getting back to your son's football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police aren't doing,#Statement-non-opinion
he didn't have a license for the gun, correct?#Yes-No-Question
I don't know.#Other answers
I mean, I don't know the details.#Statement-non-opinion
This was not a child that was on the team.#Statement-non-opinion
It was someone that, uh, show-, you know, just kind of showed up at the field.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, it was a, a student age person,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm not even,#Uninterpretable

I'm ready.#Statement-non-opinion
Well in Atlanta, Georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in Patterson, California.#Statement-opinion
Oh could, could be.#Maybe/Accept-part
Uh, this little city is only about eight thousand people.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we,#Uninterpretable
is, is crime a problem there?#Yes-No-Question
like a major problem, minor problem or,#Or-Clause
Well in Patterson there's,#Statement-non-opinion
it's not a problem here.#Statement-non-opinion
But like, uh, I lived in Oakland, uh, until just recently#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, Oakland, California, God, they've had like, uh, sixty-seven murders so far this year compared to like, uh, forty at this time last year.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's really bad there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and it's all related to drugs it seems like.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Is that what it's there too?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
I've only been here for like, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
probably just over six months I start, I#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
started school here.#Other
Uh, I came from a smaller town in, in New York#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and cri-, the city was fairly big size or not real big#Statement-non-opinion
but we had a problem there#Statement-non-opinion
but here there's just no comparison that, much more crime.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, every night the news is very depressing because it just, they run down the list of how many people were shot, you know, drive by shootings or#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whatever#Other
and it's, it, it's pretty bad.#Statement-non-opinion
They're, they're,#Uninterpretable
it's,#Uninterpretable
things have basically improved here over the last few years.#Statement-non-opinion
They've, they've actually taken steps to try to make it better#Statement-non-opinion
but it still, it still is a problem.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like I don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen.#Statement-non-opinion
Well that's, that seems to be what they were doing#Statement-non-opinion
and it has, and they've started, stepped up more patrols in certain areas#Statement-non-opinion
and it has#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
has made some places safer#Other
but, you know, it's very difficult.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean if you don't have an infinite amount of money to, to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as it is a, it's definitely a problem#Other
and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, the more, more, less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread into smaller areas unfortunately.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well I, I think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, then maybe those other people would be kind of scared#Statement-opinion
and they would not do these bad things, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think, I think that, uh, it's, uh, seems to be that, I don't know, some people they te-, they do something, you know,#Statement-opinion
they shoot somebody or whatever,#Statement-opinion
they go to jail,#Statement-opinion
sentenced to jail for like thirty years they're out in five#Statement-opinion
and they're back on the street#Statement-opinion
and then they shoot someone else#Statement-opinion
and just a, a cycle#Statement-opinion
and it seems, seems as though the, the system doesn't cha-, tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I just don't understand our, our laws here.#Statement-non-opinion
Because, you know, like in other countries, man, I mean, they're really a lot stricter than we are.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
It's, definitely true.#Statement-opinion
It seems, seems as though we try to play humanitarian I think to, a little to much *#Statement-opinion
and maybe some of the people don't deserve the, the humanitarian treatment that they get.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I don't know.#Hedge
It's a difficult situation I think#Statement-opinion
and some, something has to be done because I definitely think it's, it, it really plays, reeks havoc with your quality of life when, you know, you can see it's going on around you#Statement-opinion
but then when, once it finally affects you then, then it really starts to bother you.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh. Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it seems, I mean,#Statement-opinion
people have moved like out of the city because they want to get away from the crime#Statement-opinion
and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out#Statement-opinion
but, you know, it's only a matter of time before, you know, it still catches up with them.#Statement-opinion
You can't really run away from the problem#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and something, you know, something has to be done but just that too many people argue about how to fix it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I know when I lived in Oakland, it was just that, uh, like, I definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of, of the city by myself.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, sure.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, and then, then again some areas I wouldn't go by myself after dark#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But down here, in Patterson, well like I say, it's so small#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you can go anywhere.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's good .#Appreciation
But just, uh, like twenty miles away see in Modesto, they have, uh, those gangs and things over there.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it, it's bad.#Statement-non-opinion
In Sacramento also, they have, uh, drive by shootings it seems like all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I don't know.#Hedge
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just, I just don't know what, what they can do you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
It's, it's to bad because it's, uh, I mean, th-, just even the random occurrences where, you know, it's unsafe for a woman just to walk from the car to the, some, in certain areas like from the car, from their car to the mall or something#Statement-opinion
and it's dangerous.#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
And it's just, that's just ridiculous#Statement-opinion
and you know, it's just, that's just not right.#Statement-opinion
Something you know .#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I mean like even, even going to the grocery store.#Statement-opinion
I know we've had this one lady that was attacked, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, just, you just, you just don't know what to do anymore, you know.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And some of the times it's happening in the daytime too, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
so it's not always happening at dark.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I don't know.#Hedge
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's definitely unfortunate#Statement-opinion

Okay,#Other
uh, I guess our topic is about movies#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, what is coincidence,#Statement-non-opinion
we got a baby-sitter#Statement-non-opinion
and we went to the movies that past weekend.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, so did I#Statement-non-opinion
And we saw CAPE FEAR.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I heard that was excellent.#Statement-non-opinion
It is.#Agree/Accept
Is it?#Backchannel in question form
It's really good.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh, I wanted to see that#Statement-non-opinion
I was deciding between that and, uh, MY GIRL#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, my boyfriend and I went to see MY GIRL.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how was that?#Wh-Question
Oh, it was excellent.#Statement-non-opinion
It was a really, really good movie.#Statement-non-opinion
I'd recommend it.#Statement-non-opinion
I heard that's, a movie that, uh, you really can't take children.#Statement-non-opinion
Is that true?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, I heard the opposite that, uh, you should take children to see it.#Dispreferred answers
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
Uh, there were quite a few, uh, kids in there with their parents.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I don't know, though,#Hedge
I, I've heard that, and then what you just told me#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because, uh, the little boy dies.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Repeat-phrase
It was sad.#Statement-non-opinion
It was really sad.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, his, it kind of shows how his, uh, best friend, this little girl, deals with his death#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and how, I think, maybe, how children should deal with death.#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Maybe.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, it was really good.#Statement-non-opinion
It was sad, very sad.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I want to see that one.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Well, CAPE FEAR was, was more suspenseful.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was really suspenseful.#Statement-non-opinion
So that, that's, that's a real good movie to see.#Statement-non-opinion
I heard it was, uh, sort of like, uh, not, uh, too violent,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was kind of like, uh, gross, kind of like, uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, like.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, no,#Reject
and it, uh, it was kind of,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
it's kind of both, I guess,#Statement-opinion
but it's not, it's not as bad as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.#Statement-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
But, uh, it's just as suspenseful, I think.#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it, it was a real good movie.#Statement-non-opinion
And then we saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because we have two kids.#Other
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And FIEVEL GOES WEST#Other
Oh, I've seen, uh, previews for them on T V,#Statement-non-opinion
but I,#Uninterpretable
But, uh, those were, those were okay,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then, oh, boy, it's been, it's been so long since we've been to the movies,#Other
but I, we've rented some videos.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like to rent movies, too.#Statement-non-opinion
And I think the last one I rented was, uh, MORTAL THOUGHTS#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with Demi Moore.#Other
Oh, I, I didn't see that.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, that, that, that's okay.#Statement-non-opinion

That, that was cute.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, uh, I guess that's about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Have you rented any movies lately?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, the last movie I rented was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox#Affirmative non-yes answers

I like his movies.#Statement-non-opinion
So, do you go to the movies often,#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
No,#No answers
not too often.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I hadn't been to the movies for a really long time#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
since last weekend.#Other
But, uh, there's been movies out that I've been wanting to see.#Statement-non-opinion
I just, you know, don't get a chance to get out and see them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, we have two little kids,#Statement-non-opinion
so it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies.#Statement-non-opinion
We have to dig up a baby-sitter#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's only the only time we can go out,#Other
so our time is scarce.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, we, we, we t-, we, you know, we're, we're big movie people#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we try and do#Other
and I don't, I don't know about the last movie I've seen on T V that was real good. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I watched that movie with, uh, Barbara, uh, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
what was her name.#Self-talk
Oh, Bar-,#Uninterpretable

And, and then I saw that other movie about, uh, MOTHER, DAUGHT-, MOTHER, WIFE, MURDERER.#Statement-non-opinion
Did you see that one?#Yes-No-Question

I like, uh, the true stories.#Statement-non-opinion

They're more interesting.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's hard to believe that, you know, this really happened.#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
Some of them are pretty bad.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
But,#Uninterpretable
Huh. Well#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
We sure do have a lot in common.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If you're ever in town, we'll go see a movie#Action-directive
Okay#Agree/Accept
But, and we don't really,#Uninterpretable

Um, well, we may have just a couple over here.#Affirmative non-yes answers

Okay.#Other
Well, have you ever, uh, had a family reunion?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
and, uh, let me tell you#Offers, Options Commits
this is a really neat thing to do too, that they did,#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Some of the other people, the older people organized it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, what they did, they had, uh, a book made up#Statement-non-opinion
and it was like,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when our ancestors first came over.#Other
No kidding.#Appreciation
And, then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, like, how many kids you had, and who you had married,#Other
and, you know, it went through like,#Statement-non-opinion
and it showed who my, uh, well, who my husband's parents were, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, who he married and then how many children we had and then like his brothers and sisters#Other
and it went through the whole family and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's so neat.#Appreciation
And, it was so good.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, great#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it, it really did,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, and plus it's got a lot more people interested in it because,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you got to participate sort of.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, so did everybody send in their information and they made a book up,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
about it,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then you could get it at the reunion.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
And, everybody got a book,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, nice.#Appreciation
that came to the reunion.#Other
And, it told like, uh, you know, where the first Connallys came over,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had#Statement-non-opinion
and it just kept coming on up through the generations.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
So, it was really, that was really neat.#Statement-non-opinion
That is neat.#Appreciation
And,#Uninterpretable
So, do you have a big family?#Yes-No-Question
Well, he does#Affirmative non-yes answers
Oh, he does?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He does,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any#Statement-non-opinion
That's kind of how my husband and I are.#Statement-non-opinion
I have a kind of a big family#Statement-non-opinion
and he just has himself and his brother and his parents,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's it.#Statement-non-opinion
So, he had to kind of get used to us when we first started going together.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's what, that's what happened when I, when I first, uh, met my husband.#Statement-non-opinion
I said, this can't be, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
nobody can have this many relatives,#Quotation
.#Non-verbal
because a lot of them lived in like a group, you know, down one highway.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, there was a lake,#Statement-non-opinion
and they all lived down there by it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how nice.#Appreciation
And, so, we were going down,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
the highway, you know,#Other
and he kept saying, this is where my uncle lives#Statement-non-opinion
and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my gosh.#Appreciation
and I kept thinking, this guy is putting me on.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Nobody has this many relatives, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, but,#Statement-non-opinion
How funny.#Appreciation
they really were all there.#Other
And, another thing that's really good about, uh, family reunions,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is having everybody just cook whatever is their specialty,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and bring it.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
At, because nobody it seemed like, liked the same thing.#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But you had a choice#Statement-non-opinion
and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and get a lot of good recipes.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Where if you said a certain thing and say, okay, we're all going to have fried fish, or, we're all going,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to have fried chicken.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Everybody might not like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Not be able to do it.#Collaborative Completion
So, did people come like from out of town to the reunion#Declarative Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah.#Yes answers
Yeah,#Yes answers
They did.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they came from all over.#Statement-non-opinion
Did you put them up in other people's houses#Yes-No-Question
or did you have hotel rooms,#Or-Clause
or, how did you do it?#Wh-Question
Um, they just stayed with different ones of them.#Statement-non-opinion
They did.#Repeat-phrase
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They just came down and like say, okay, this aunt and Uncle Kip, uh, all their kids and their grand kids and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
and then,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they had it.#Other
It had gotten so big that they had it at the church.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
And, they had a church service ahead of it,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, and then they had, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
How nice.#Appreciation
uh, then they ate out on the ground.#Other
And they just brought food with them?#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Did they just have like over a weekend?#Yes-No-Question
Is that how they did it?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Repeat-phrase
Well, I'm real curious because my family,#Statement-non-opinion
it didn't sound,#Statement-opinion
I don't think my family is as big as your husband's.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't think we'd need a whole church,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, the problem is we are all really scattered,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
around.#Other
There isn't any one place where most of us live,#Statement-non-opinion
so if we ever had a reunion, we'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you know, there would be one person who lived there that would have a house,#Statement-non-opinion
but they couldn't put everybody up.#Statement-non-opinion
So it, I think it would get kind of expensive.#Statement-non-opinion
But, you know what you can do?#Yes-No-Question
Huh?#Wh-Question
A lot of these lakes and things, if you could find a centrally located, like, say about the same distance for all of you all to come?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They have these places where you can rent them#Statement-non-opinion
and it, you know, like on a lake,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like, uh, it's a big place,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, it's not very expensive that way.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you mean#Uninterpretable
so,#Uninterpretable
oh, I see,#Statement-non-opinion
so everybody could stay together?#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
It's like a,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they have like a,#Other
a house or something.#Collaborative Completion
a convention type thing.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, then it has little rooms off of it where,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh!#Appreciation
you know, you'd go and sleep at night time.#Other
But, then it has like a kitchenette and things like that#Statement-non-opinion
but you,#Uninterpretable
See, that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than if you all were in your own hotels or something.#Other
And another,#Uninterpretable
And then, every time you wanted to go eat with somebody, you'd probably have to go to out, eat or something.#Statement-non-opinion
It would run into a lot of money.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, they had,#Uninterpretable
that was,#Uninterpretable
you know, that,#Uninterpretable
That sounds like fun.#Appreciation
what you can do is, you can write different places, the Chamber of Commerce,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
tell them what you're interested in.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Ask them what they have,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, at area lakes and all.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If they have something like that#Other
because now every time we plan anything, just about, we write to the Chamber of Commerce of where we're going because,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you can find out so much easier,#Other
You get a,#Collaborative Completion
that way, than try to locate it, you know,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
calling different places can r-, really run you up a bill.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you can't get it exact, you know, usually,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, and then everybody goes to that place.#Statement-non-opinion
And that is not bad at all.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, they have, lot of times they'll have like, uh, little cabins,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have, you know, just the single bunk beds and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, they can all stay in those cabins.#Statement-non-opinion
And then, you know, you can have cookouts and stuff like that#Statement-non-opinion
that doesn't cost you as much.#Statement-non-opinion
That would be great.#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
That would be really nice#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, that's, uh, you know, that's the best way I found,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because whenever you have,#Other
That sounds good.#Appreciation
something where you go and,#Other
now we had one,#Statement-non-opinion
this was before I lost a lot more of my family,#Statement-non-opinion
but it wasn't any of my immediate family anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I didn't have any of them left.#Other
But, um#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they had, uh, uh, thing where you could, everybody could come and meet and go out to eat.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I didn't think that was as good. Because,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was like, you know, you couldn't really talk and stuff, like you could when,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you were at the lake,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or somewhere, you know, where you were out.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
This was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant.#Statement-non-opinion
And you have to sit at a table and just,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, it just,#Uninterpretable
I didn't like that much.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, um, did you,#Uninterpretable
was it hard to decide who to invite and who not to invite.#Yes-No-Question
I mean, did you have to draw a line,#Yes-No-Question
or did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
Like, they just#Uninterpretable
whoever#Declarative Yes-No-Question
What they did was,#Other answers
wanted to come.#Other
Well, see what they did was, okay, they, uh, they wrote to all the initial people, you know,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the, the oldest ones.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay,#Uninterpretable
then those in turn got a hold of these other ones.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they had like,#Statement-non-opinion
I think there was four or five different people,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that would call,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, some of them, if they didn't have their addresses and all on them,#Other
and, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they told them that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information, we had to tell them how many people were going to be coming, you know.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then, when they, when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter, it, uh, you know, to get the information and all,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it asked, you know, will you be willing to bring#Other
and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Response Acknowledgement
And, so, really there wasn't any problem with,#Statement-non-opinion
that's the reason it ended up in a church because,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, there was just so many of them.#Other
There,#Other
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, it turned out so much better like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because everybody knew, they knew ahead of time how many people to expect.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now if there was a sickness or something like that, I mean, you know, you're not going to lose#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that many.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No that would just be a few.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But how about like because of divorce and stuff like that?#Open-Question
Like my parents are divorced,#Statement-non-opinion
Okay well,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they are both remarried#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, there, I mean, there's,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
Well, see, then#Uninterpretable
okay,#Uninterpretable
if you wanted them both to come,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then you would put, you would have put that down on the list#Other
and you would have sent, you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and ask for their information.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So then,#Uninterpretable
To send back to those other people.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I'm kind of like, in control over who comes. Uh, just from my family.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because once it went to the, the oldest people and then they knew who they wanted to invite,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then, they sent their little things to us.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay,#Uninterpretable
it was up to me,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
who I was going to, you know,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whether I wanted my kids and, you know, my, any of my family to come.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
I see,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's a pretty good idea to do it that way.#Statement-non-opinion
And then, you know, it never did,#Uninterpretable
like if I didn't want somebody to come, then I just wouldn't send them one of the questionnaires.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So there really wasn't a problem that way.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, that's a real good idea.#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, I tell you what, that's the neatest book we've got,#Statement-non-opinion
I bet.#Appreciation
course we've got, we've still got it#Statement-non-opinion
and they charged us, I think it was like, it was like five or six dollars, I can't remember#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
exactly, you know,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that we paid for the book to be printed.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's not, uh, it's not a hard back book, it's just a, oh, like a, you know, folder type thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it has the entire,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, it has everybody that you could ever imagine,#Statement-non-opinion
How neat.#Appreciation
and some you couldn't#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know, that's really neat.#Statement-opinion
That's really neat.#Statement-opinion
and, it will be something my kids will have, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Just like,#Uninterpretable
I was just thinking of that.#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What you could tell your kids.#Other
Because if you stop and think,#Uninterpretable
I don't know if you're like me,#Hedge
but I know very little about before my grandparents.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, very, very little about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I just,#Uninterpretable
the thing is I know a lot of stories,#Statement-non-opinion
but I can't remember who it was about.#Statement-non-opinion
My grandparents told us when I was growing up and even when I was an adult#Statement-non-opinion
they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their best friends, cause they all grew up in New York City,#Statement-non-opinion
but I can't, you know, I remember these stories#Statement-non-opinion
but I have no idea who it was that was in those stories.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I mean, I couldn't give an accurate,#Statement-non-opinion
I couldn't tell my kids what, you know, those people were like,#Statement-non-opinion
I just remember they had some funny stories,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't know who it was.#Statement-non-opinion
Maybe what you could do if you couldn't get into a full family reunion,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you wanted to go back some,#Other
but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then you can find out from, you know, you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these,#Other

Jay, um,#Other
my kids are, are both in college, um,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'd, I played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go.#Statement-non-opinion
On the other hand, they really decided themselves.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, what, what kind of experience did you have?#Open-Question
Well, I, uh,#Uninterpretable
one girl went in, in state and has graduated,#Statement-non-opinion
and then, uh, that was, uh, you know, that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I have, uh, one, out of, two out of state, both in Missouri,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, I teach, uh, in a college,#Statement-non-opinion
and so I they had heard me talk about it, and for years, that I didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, so, that was#Uninterpretable
Um.#Uninterpretable
pretty much, uh.#Other
I see,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I, may, maybe I'm wrong,#Hedge
but I think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and,#Statement-opinion
Oh, oh, if they, if they're content there,#Collaborative Completion
and, and the appropriate support environment and things like that.#Other
I mean as far as the education, as far as looking at the degree at the end, that, uh, it's very little difference is paid#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to it, where you get that bachelor's.#Other
Uh, if it's a halfway decent school#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they should be happy naturally,#Other
and if they can get, uh, um, two out of,#Statement-non-opinion
let's see, my son got a full total scholarships#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so there's, uh, there's plenty of scholarships out there,#Statement-opinion
and so people should be advised to look for those,#Statement-opinion
and, um,#Uninterpretable
Did, did you play a, a strong role in helping them pick schools#Yes-No-Question
or#Or-Clause
Uh.#Uninterpretable
did you just sort of say listen to your guidance counselors#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Well, they, uh,#Hold before answer/agreement
I went, we went around,#Statement-non-opinion
my son was a, graduated from a Jesuit high school#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so he, he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university,#Statement-non-opinion
and so there#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
that was limited to five or six different places#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, so he's in Saint Louis U,#Statement-non-opinion
and I guess I played a role in that.#Statement-opinion
I, I just sort of, uh, let them, um, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
they'd all been, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
pretty efficient as far as studies#Other
and, uh, so I didn't have that much to do,#Statement-non-opinion
they just, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they just knew they wanted to go to college,#Other
and I, you know, helped them get there as far as#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
traveling with them to look at different#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
places.#Other
We did do that,#Statement-non-opinion
and I would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's a great idea,#Statement-opinion
I mean, that,#Uninterpretable
Some people don't do it,#Statement-opinion
and then they get there and hate it, or whatever,#Statement-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if it's possible.#Other
It's, it seemed expensive at the time you're doing it, but, but the#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
compared to the, the total decision it's nothing.#Other
I think in the short run it is expensive.#Statement-opinion
In the long run it's very, uh, reasonable#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if the person,#Other
my daughter has been in, in Missouri for a second year,#Statement-non-opinion
now she's coming home at the end of the semester#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, uh, you know, she's already twenty-one.#Statement-non-opinion
She started late.#Statement-non-opinion
So that's, you know, strictly up to her,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, she'll finish down here, uh, uh, finish this year down here and then decide what she's going to do next year.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It'll save me a lot of money because I'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but again, that's her decision#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, uh, but I have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back,#Statement-non-opinion
and they're much better students at twenty-five, twenty-six, may, twenty-eight.#Statement-opinion
So, you know, I don't, I never have pushed them.#Statement-non-opinion
I just say that education is important, you should do it, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, they have to do the work#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, uh.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, back, back to this visiting thing,#Action-directive
I mean, I found that my kids had no conception what college was really like#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and being able to go with them to so-, at least some of them#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I think so.#Agree/Accept
gave me a chance to explain things to them and to, uh, in reference to what we had seen.#Other
And also I'm opposed to the, to the size.#Statement-opinion
They've just gotten so huge,#Statement-opinion
and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand,#Statement-non-opinion
see that's just too many.#Statement-opinion
Good grief#Appreciation
Ended up going to where I used to go,#Statement-non-opinion
and that was twenty-five hundred when I went there,#Statement-non-opinion
it's twenty-one thousand, now#Statement-non-opinion
it's too big.#Statement-opinion
Good grief.#Appreciation
So,#Uninterpretable
What is twenty-one thousand?#Wh-Question
Pardon?#Signal-non-understanding
What school is that?#Wh-Question
It's Southwest Missouri State University#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, it was twenty-five hundred when I went there forty years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, my son's in a school about seven thousand,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's, that's not bad#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I teach in a school about eight thousand,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's, that's even a little large#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
but it's much better than twenty-one thousand.#Statement-opinion
But they do have to visit, and if, if the parent can point out all the different places to look for#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for scholarships,#Other
and then, oh, those rating, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't think it hurts to look at them#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
I don't put that much stock in them,#Statement-opinion
but#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
probably fine just to compare.#Statement-opinion
Helps to at least set up#Summarize/reformulate
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
range of things to look at.#Other
If they, you know, uh, they need to,#Statement-opinion

Think about, uh, taxes.#Action-directive
Well, I think they're a necessary evil.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I wish the government would operate on the same premise that, uh, businesses operate on#Statement-opinion
and that is, uh#Statement-opinion
You spend what you have#Collaborative Completion
and,#Uninterpretable
you, you don't spend more than you, than you bring in.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that, the general idea is to s-, you know, spend, uh, during a time of recession that, you know, for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy,#Statement-opinion
but they're running under the assump-,#Statement-opinion
you know, the way they're running it now, they're h-, you know, running it under a deficit spending, you know, while we're not under a recession,#Statement-opinion
so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running,#Statement-opinion
so that's kind of a basic thing of economics, I guess, keep spending, keep going into debt,#Statement-opinion
you're not going to payoff what you owe,#Statement-opinion
but, so, I guess the, the question was more like, uh, do you get what you pay f-, you know, get what you pay for.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I,#Uninterpretable
it just depends.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, uh, roads are very expensive, uh, commodity and so is, uh, utilities they supply and police and fire department, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, they need to make a living.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There's,#Uninterpretable
So I think for, for, for many years, uh, we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are, uh, to a great extent, public servants#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society.#Other
I agree with that.#Appreciation
But, uh, then again, uh, it's the, hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of, of, uh, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.#Statement-opinion
I guess,#Uninterpretable
I'm, I'm a student right now#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't make a whole lot of money#Statement-non-opinion
and, so, I, I kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to, I guess, uh, compared to what I get, because I, you know, all my, my education is state sponsored.#Statement-non-opinion
I go to a state sponsored school#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, my education all up through high school and stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
so I guess I'm kind of in debt, I, I suppose, because I don't, you know, been paying taxes all that, all that long.#Statement-non-opinion
My parents, I guess, h-, h-, however, have contributed to that, you know, for the education side of it and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I usually end up getting money back.#Statement-non-opinion
I will this year anyway from a,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, you're very fortunate.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I am#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I need it, too,#Statement-non-opinion
otherwise,#Uninterpretable
We just try not to pay any more in than we have to,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, we pay in a substantial amount. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We don't regret paying taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
We do think that, uh, sometimes, uh, we have a reverse of a regressive tax, a progressive tax.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And progressive tax, I think, uh, does not give people incentive to make more money,#Statement-opinion
and what I mean by that, the more income you make, the more tax you pay.#Statement-opinion
More taxes you pay.#Collaborative Completion
It should be, I think, a flat percentage#Statement-opinion
and, uh, that percentage ought to be an equitable amount.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Isn't,#Uninterpretable
Uh, last year when they passed the tax laws for the, uh, nineteen ninety, ninety-one, whatever, nineteen ninety-one#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
everything else,#Other
and I totaled them all up#Statement-non-opinion
and basically, uh, we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
Now, that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every, for every item on there#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even though there's, uh, taxes on different things.#Other
Well isn't,#Uninterpretable
But, you know, there's f-, there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying, uh,#Statement-opinion
like when you buy a tire, you pay a federal excise tax.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's a lot, yeah, lot of hidden taxes.#Statement-opinion
You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your, your#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
tank.#Other
The taxes that people don't think about that,#Statement-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
the, the, the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay, I guess.#Statement-opinion
But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There was that,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
which can-,#Uninterpretable
was it Jerry Brown,#Statement-non-opinion
one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the, the tax codes they have now and implementing a f-, I think a flat percentage, something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you impl-, implemented a flat percentage, it would encourage people, uh, to make more money#Statement-opinion
and the, what people need to understand in my opinion, now this is just my opinion, okay, uh, is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, so, if they penalize businesses, business people are smart enough to say, here's my break point, I'm not going to work any harder#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and make any more or create any more jobs.#Other
Exactly.#Appreciation
That's, because#Uninterpretable
And so,#Uninterpretable
until, like eight,#Other
Based on that, who do you think you're talking to,#Statement-non-opinion
you're talking to an employer.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
Up until, like, eighty-five or something was the,#Statement-non-opinion

Do you have any?#Yes-No-Question
I'm trying to think offhand#Other answers
I can't think of anything, you know.#Negative non-no answers
I have, I have one,#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
and it's a real pet peeve of mine.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
It seems I, I do work during the day#Statement-non-opinion
and when I'm home, uh, you know I'm either cooking or running doing,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
things or, uh, laundry or stuff.#Other
And I hate when the phone rings and it turns out to be a telephone salesman.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's real,#Uninterpretable
the two pet peeves that,#Statement-non-opinion
number one, I really feel that that's my private, you know, my own home.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I ha-,#Uninterpretable
and if I want something, I will get it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I will go out and get it myself.#Statement-non-opinion
And I will never, I never buy anything from a telephone,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I wouldn't,#Agree/Accept
salesperson.#Other
either,#Other
no.#Agree/Accept
So, I really feel that it is a real invasion, they're invading my time and my space#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
by, you know, interfering in whatever I'm doing#Other
fr-,#Uninterpretable
and I,#Uninterpretable
it really bothers me.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, it's a little bit like junk mail but except you can't, you know, ignore it, uh, quite as easily.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I, I try to be polite,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but at the same point,#Statement-non-opinion
That doesn't always work.#Collaborative Completion
Well, I just say thank you very much for calling but I'm not interested,#Statement-non-opinion
and then I hang up before they can say anything.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yes,#Yes answers
and it works very well#Statement-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because you don't hear, you know how,#Statement-non-opinion
they can say anything they want#Statement-non-opinion
it's just,#Uninterpretable
but I just feel that's my big thing on the invasion of, my thing on invasion of privacy.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, I have, uh, I sort of have a sort like#Statement-non-opinion
you can prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists.#Statement-non-opinion
I wish that there were a way that you could, um, get your tele-, you know, submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty for anyone who calls you to sell things,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
from a busi-,#Other
well, how do you get your name off the junk mailing list?#Wh-Question
Uh, you, you, you, you do that by, uh, um,#Statement-non-opinion
the postal service has some information which you fill out and they send,#Statement-non-opinion
it's for every company,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean you can't do it for any compan-,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, but you can then send it#Statement-non-opinion
and they can pro-,#Statement-non-opinion
they tell,#Uninterpretable
that company is not allowed to sent it, you any junk mail.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
If you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I didn't even know that.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out to, not to get, you know, junk mail from specific companies.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
And I wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you could say that, uh, have your na-, your number put in a registry.#Statement-non-opinion
And then anyone making these calls have to check that registry for that area#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and could not, should, and is not allowed under penalty of, you know, being reported or something to call you.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that would be one way of doing it.#Statement-non-opinion
I can't really think of anything that invades my privacy,#Statement-non-opinion
but one of my pet peeves, you came up with the telephone is, when you have an answering machine and they hang up before they leave a message.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can't stand that.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I think that is so stupid, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
because,#Uninterpretable
Oh, I'm guilty of that sometimes#Statement-non-opinion
because I've called and there really wasn't any significant message#Statement-non-opinion
and I, and I wasn't going to be available to be called back.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was sort of like, oh, the hell,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not going to spend the time giving,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
leaving a message,#Other
and, uh, I'll call later,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if I'm available.#Other
The other thing that, um, that there is recourse to and that's another thing, is when you, you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, leg-, legally now they're not allowed,#Statement-non-opinion
they're n-,#Uninterpretable
you do not have to give a telephone number.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yes.#Yes answers
And I don't really like announcing in public#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, when you're sitting there,#Statement-non-opinion
my telephone and I don't like the wa-, way telephone numbers can be used.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number,#Statement-non-opinion
but it turned out it had to have been my husband's office phone number.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, we were able, we weren't actually able to trace it, but we were able to, to discard the charges.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, but it was,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't like how they a-,#Statement-non-opinion
the,#Uninterpretable
I, I realize that this is your identification#Statement-non-opinion
but I worked with someone that got hold of his,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
charge cards,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and his social security number.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
same with my husband.#Statement-non-opinion
It was the charge card and social security number.#Statement-non-opinion
And, you know, I don't, I don't like, I don't g-, ever get anything over the phone because I don't want to give my social security number out.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you should never give the social security number.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, if sometimes, if you charge,#Statement-non-opinion
sometimes I charge theater tickets#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
over the phone.#Other
And then, you know, because they pick them up at the box office we'll call.#Statement-non-opinion
But, um, that's the only thing I would ever have ever used it for the phone#Statement-non-opinion
and that was because I initiated it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and occasionally I do order things from catalogs#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
over the phone.#Other
But again it's, I initiate it not the company.#Statement-non-opinion
The other thing is though you do not have to,#Statement-non-opinion
if you're buying something in a store and they as-, and you pay for it by charge and they ask you for your telephone number, you do not have to give it.#Statement-non-opinion
That is one, that's a law that went into effect, I don't know a year or two ago.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I never even knew that.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, you can just say I'm sorry that yo-, uh, I'm not required to give that by law#Statement-non-opinion
and then they won't,#Uninterpretable
a lot of stores will still ask.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, the credit card company, you know, accepts the charges.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it-,#Uninterpretable
a rea-,#Uninterpretable
the credit cards company's responsibility.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, is there any,#Yes-No-Question
So wha-, in this ,#Uninterpretable
like pet peeves that you have that don't necessarily invade your privacy?#Other
Um, well, this would, this is limited to the privacy issue, the invasion of privacy.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I guess, uh, that was my, that's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy. For people outside the family, of course,#Statement-non-opinion
I've got little pet peeves, you know, with my family.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
You know. But of course, th-,#Uninterpretable
I guess that just comes with the, uh, with the territory with a family that#Statement-opinion
does a mother can do some privacy.#Uninterpretable
I really,#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
can't think of any that would invade my privacy#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
Nothing that you felt that, you know,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
any experiences you've had at work?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
I, you know, othe-,#Uninterpretable
I, I really can't say anything that would really bother me.#Statement-non-opinion
So many things I think over the years have been, um, accepted, I mean when you, uh, that are no longer done.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean I can remember when I was very young, much younger and I applied for a job#Statement-non-opinion
they said, well, d-, aren't you planning to have children.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I mean, that's none of their business.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And but of course, now by law they can't ask that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I mean there has been I think a lot to, done to protect privacy.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
especially between women and,#Statement-non-opinion
How do you feel,#Open-Question
you know, like AIDS and all that stuff?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, with se-, you know, your sex, you know .#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I-,#Uninterpretable
i-,#Uninterpretable
they've gotten a lot with, uh,#Uninterpretable
applications and stuff and aren't allowed to ask.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
Do you feel that drug testing is an invasion of privacy?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
because,#Uninterpretable
Or AIDS testing?#Other
I think it's for the better of like i-,#Statement-non-opinion
you mean like for working and stuff?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
uh-huh.#Yes answers
No,#No answers
I don't because I think whenever, and something like that#Statement-non-opinion
they're looking out for everyone.#Statement-opinion
They're not,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, I think it's more safety than anything else.#Statement-opinion
I feel that way too.#Agree/Accept
I sometimes feel th-, you know, sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I know,#Uninterpretable
You know, for example airline pilots.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean I do want my pilot to be sober#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I know,#Uninterpretable
I worked at a still mill in this summer.#Statement-non-opinion
And I know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, um, I've covered for people that came in drunk, you know, on the late shift or something,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it, and it's dangerous.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't even like having them around.#Statement-non-opinion
I kind of do their work for them because they make it more hazardous than what it is without them, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know i-,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
I feel, you know, I think some of the people that oppose, you know, mandatory drug testing for certain areas say, well, it's not,#Statement-opinion

How would you go about organizing a family reunion?#Wh-Question
Well, a-,#Uninterpretable
for,#Uninterpretable
I grew up in the deep south like south Alabama.#Statement-non-opinion
So whenever I think of family reunions,#Uninterpretable
my family, like, got together almost every week.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gee.#Appreciation
And there would be like thirty people.#Statement-non-opinion
So people talk about, you know, big family reunions#Statement-non-opinion
and I think, like#Uninterpretable
I have a friend who just went to, like, Wyoming to some big ranch, you know, where like there were four hundred people#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my.#Appreciation
for their family reunion.#Other
And I,#Uninterpretable
so I mean, how I would go about doing it is I would just call all my relatives.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I, since I came from,#Uninterpretable
my father has, uh, five sisters and two brothers#Statement-non-opinion
and my mother has four brothers and two sisters.#Statement-non-opinion
So I ca-,#Uninterpretable
both of my parents had big families,#Statement-non-opinion
and we always wer-, we always got together, just always.#Statement-non-opinion
Now it's different because I live here#Statement-non-opinion
and I,#Uninterpretable
you know, when I go home I try to see the families, as much of the family as I can#Statement-non-opinion
but#Uninterpretable
Yes.#Agree/Accept
it's real different.#Other
And I grew up in a real not, I think not normal setting.#Statement-non-opinion
With all of you living so close together.#Summarize/reformulate
Right.#Agree/Accept
I mean Sunday dinner was at my grandmother's#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, like I said there would be thirty, you know, thirty people,#Statement-non-opinion
and everyone would just bring things#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
my grandmother would cook and cook and cook.#Other
And i-,#Uninterpretable
Well, I come from a very small family.#Statement-non-opinion
And we planned a family reunion this spring. Uh, where we are from Texas#Statement-non-opinion
and my family is from Ohio#Statement-non-opinion
and we met in Florida.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to Disney together.#Statement-non-opinion
So that's all the family,#Statement-non-opinion
so planning our family reunio-, reunion was very easy you know .#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess so.#Maybe/Accept-part
It really sounds like it was fun.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well, we had a wonderful tim-,#Statement-non-opinion

Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on#Statement-non-opinion
and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.#Statement-opinion
That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about,#Statement-non-opinion
because I, because we never went to war.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out#Statement-opinion
and I,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I feel like it went on and on.#Other
And I, I guess I see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had, where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for, for what was happening.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, I just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm not sure that's our role,#Statement-opinion
but.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I agree with that,#Agree/Accept
I was, I was fairly young at the time too,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I really don't have very many memories about it at all, in fact.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, my husband is a Vietnam veteran#Statement-non-opinion
and i-, you know, he in looking at the Persian Gulf war that just went on, he,#Uninterpretable
i-, it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the Vietnam vets did not have, from the people or the administration, either one.#Statement-non-opinion
Don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time?#Yes-No-Question
I mean I do think that, i-, i-, it's been too long in coming#Statement-opinion
but I feel like maybe the American people and, and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support that#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that those,#Other
so many people were opposed to the war,#Statement-non-opinion
what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it#Statement-non-opinion
and those guys were there doing their duty.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
I mean, they weren't there by choice#Statement-opinion
and, and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I, I think that we learned from that#Statement-opinion
and I think it, it's one of those things that you learn the hard way.#Statement-opinion
It was a tragic mistake,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the way that they have been treated over the years and I believe that's just now turning around. Just now, you know, trying to be rectified#Statement-opinion
and I'm, and I'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on so many of the people.#Other
No,#Agree/Accept
I don't think you can#Agree/Accept
and I, I agree with you that I, I think that the, the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in, in, in every aspect of it#Statement-opinion
and I, I agree with you also, that I feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war.#Statement-opinion
I mean they're still not settled over there.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
they're not.#Agree/Accept
And I have a feeling that the Persian Gulf crisis is going to be the same way.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think we're going to end up back there in a few years or, if, if not sooner.#Statement-opinion
Well I, I appreciate the fa-,#Uninterpretable
I feel like President Bush is in a hard spot.#Statement-opinion
He went over there to get them out of Kuwait, which he did.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then he has backed out,#Statement-non-opinion
he has pulled out.#Statement-non-opinion
And I realize they're still saying, well here you're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein,#Statement-non-opinion
so why aren't you helping us?#Quotation
And you see, I think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation.#Statement-opinion
I think it would too.#Agree/Accept
And I don't think the U S will stand for it.#Statement-opinion
I don't think he would do that,#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
uh, I think we learned too much#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree with that.#Agree/Accept
of the effects.#Other
Uh, you know whether it was justified or not, I know, that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause.#Statement-opinion
I, I feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and beat the communism,#Other
but, but I think somewhere that got lost.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, in the long term effects of the, of the war#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
We-, you have to, i-, you know, you have to give Bush a lot of credit for he, he said that's what we were going there to do#Statement-opinion
and he did what, what he said#Statement-non-opinion
and he did pull out before it got any further than that where,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where it would have turned into more of a police action. Uh, or more of a political action I guess, you getting into their governmental affairs which you really can't do as, as another country.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, th-, my, my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries#Statement-non-opinion
and we have so many problems here at home that we don't address.#Statement-opinion
That we don't get fixed.#Summarize/reformulate
That's right.#Agree/Accept
I know.#Agree/Accept
And, and tha-, that's what frustrates me more than anything.#Statement-non-opinion
And I, I believe that we have to have a military#Statement-opinion
and I believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward.#Statement-opinion
I think there's a lot of waste#Statement-opinion
and, and they don't, i-, if they could just cut out all the fat and, and get it lean, and start addressing some of the other issues,#Statement-opinion
I think we could take care of everything. And quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world,#Statement-opinion
Ye-,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, who just end up using things against us later on anyway.#Other
I know,#Agree/Accept
I do think that in the Middle East war, um,#Uninterpretable
I think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with, uh, kind of a different attitude.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
An, uh, and I think that's good, you know,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's a good,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
a lot of good has come from this one.#Statement-opinion
I think so too.#Agree/Accept
And I think, I guess, in, in, uh, ironic way a lot of good came from the Vietnam war toward this war#Statement-opinion
because like we, we said earlier, that, you know, the a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of, of that war#Statement-opinion
and and,#Uninterpretable
And perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we had the experience of Vietnam.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
So, I, I, I do think that, we've learned from it,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, I, I, I wish there weren't war#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
no kidding.#Agree/Accept
But, uh, I do think we learned.#Statement-opinion
And I just, I just hate the emotional price a lot of the Vietnam people paid,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
for, you know, er-, nothing.#Other
I mean, it was, they're, they still don't know what they were there for.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
there was no feeling of accomplishment, no goal,#Statement-opinion
no,#Agree/Accept
No.#Agree/Accept
we went in#Statement-non-opinion
but what did we do.#Rhetorical-Questions
We lost lives#Statement-non-opinion
and, and what were we trying to do.#Rhetorical-Questions
Who knows.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
And, I, I think you're right,#Agree/Accept
uh, I think you're right there.#Agree/Accept
Um, I do remember when it was over.#Statement-non-opinion
I remember when they were coming home.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, but, I remember the feeling back then, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
like I feel like right now, I feel like this country has been behind this war.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's a lot of people that aren't for war.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not for war,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right.#Statement-opinion
I don't remember that feeling back in Vietnam.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just remember,#Uninterpretable
oh yeah,#Quotation
our guys are over there#Quotation
and it's sad#Quotation
and we shouldn't be fighting a war#Quotation
but there was no, let's support them, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we-,#Uninterpretable
the,#Uninterpretable
when this war broke out it frustrated me all thi-, the antiwar people and, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
their, all the demonstrations that were going on.#Other
I felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity#Statement-opinion
because those kind of people, I mean, you know, they're the kind of people who are, who've always got to have a cause, whether it's good, bad of indifferent.#Statement-opinion
They've got to have a cause#Statement-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
That's right. *#Agree/Accept
and, I, you know, nobody says because you're supporting the troops that you're, you're supporting the war.#Other
That's right.#Other
Yo-, you have to support the people that are there.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
And som-, for some reason those people don't see that.#Statement-opinion
They don't see it as supporting the folks, the people.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
no,#Agree/Accept
they don't#Agree/Accept
and, you know, they're just real shallow people.#Statement-opinion
I would agree with you there#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I agree.#Agree/Accept
Um, and I, and I recall when President Bush said that, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
he said look,#Statement-non-opinion
I, you know, I'm sorry that you're opposed to the war.#Quotation
There's a lot of us that are opposed to war#Quotation
but, uh, you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing.#Quotation
And I remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But,#Uninterpretable
I mean they're not helping anybody.#Statement-opinion
That's the, that's the whole point,#Statement-opinion
Th-, not.#Uninterpretable
they're not doing anything for anybody except themselves.#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
And I don't even know what they're doing for themselves.#Statement-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Other
Giving a soapbox to stand on#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, well, I just, I, I'm glad we've learned.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sorry we had the experience of Vietnam.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, and I'm, I'm, I'm especially sorry for the people that are, you know, have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally,#Statement-non-opinion
because, you know until the la-, past four or five years, nobody ever really worried about that,#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
for them.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and I think that's where we as American people really failed, you know, failed them.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I don't know.#Hedge
Well, do you have anything else you want to say on this?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I guess not.#Statement-non-opinion
I think this is the first time that I haven't been cut off by the computer#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Agree/Accept
we get cut off all the time, too#Statement-non-opinion
Usually I can talk all day#Statement-non-opinion
but this is something to me that's sad#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Agree/Accept
So, well have a good day#Conventional-closing

My name's Mary Dell,#Statement-non-opinion
and I live in the Dallas, Texas area where there's a lot of pollution#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I'm up in Wisconsin#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, my name is Terry#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, in the small town we don't,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollution.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'll go ahead and start recording that,#Action-directive
Okay.#Agree/Accept
Okay, um,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just in particular here in the Twin Cities we have a lot of big corporations#Statement-non-opinion
and, um#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm sure there's a lot of pollution.#Other
We, uh,#Uninterpretable
before moving to Wisconsin lived across from where they were, um, gravel pits#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and also where they were making tar,#Other
and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Ooh.#Appreciation
it would, uh,#Other
smell the continuous,#Uninterpretable
you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it was like miles away,#Other
but just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution,#Other
and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
also, um, where we also lived, too, it was very close to a highway,#Other
so got a lot of fumes from, uh, trucks#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and cars#Other
and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it was#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gosh,#Appreciation
on your tables,#Other
you would dust every day,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was dirty, um, type of dust,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for,#Uninterpretable
I live in a small, um, town now quite a ways from the Twin Cities, about an hour away,#Statement-non-opinion
and I may dust once a week,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's all it needs versus every day when I lived in the city#Statement-non-opinion
Huh#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
I'd never thought about that being a cause,#Other
I have to dust a lot as well.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, it comes right on through#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
through the screens,#Other
the only way that you could actually live in the, in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house#Other
My goodness.#Appreciation
and so it was quite a dirty city.#Statement-opinion
Um, if you were well protected by trees, which catch a lot of the pollution#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then you're fine,#Other
but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises, you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution#Statement-opinion
and it's just going#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for miles and miles and miles,#Other
and it's landing somewhere with the wind,#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
That's kind of the way Dallas is.#Statement-opinion
We're so flat and open,#Statement-opinion
and I live in a suburb that doesn't have much vegetation, trees#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was all cotton fields,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we don't have that advantage,#Other
and ours I think is primarily cars, where we don't carpool like we should#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
an airport.#Other
I work in a building,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm nineteen floors up#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I look out toward D F W International,#Statement-non-opinion
and there's just an awful brown haze all the time#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I can imagine it's even worse for people living over near the airport.#Statement-opinion
Oh, sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's,#Uninterpretable
I mean, our air quality, um, in the Twin Cities is a lot better than what we've heard about California and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
maybe in the other areas,#Other
but, um, they were always talking about the air quality of today is this, you know, the ozone or whatever,#Statement-opinion
and it's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and many people are too busy getting to work, not thinking about, Okay, I could have carpooled with a friend,#Statement-opinion
even#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
my husband was, uh, talking to some of the guys at work,#Other
now he's, uh, fifteen miles away from work,#Statement-non-opinion
but he was talking, wouldn't it be nice to carpool,#Statement-non-opinion
and the guy says, Well, it's too close,#Statement-non-opinion
it wouldn't pay#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, so.#Uninterpretable
Want to meet my own schedule#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and,#Uninterpretable
those are the arguments we hear,#Other
ex-, exactly, and so, my husband says, Well, that's fine, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, the gas,#Other
and, no,#Uninterpretable
everybody has their preference to drive by themselves#Statement-opinion
or, if they do, they, they drive with one little buddy, uh,#Statement-opinion
at least it's with one person#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but most of the time people are saying forget it.#Statement-opinion
I don't want to carpool,#Quotation
it's too much of a hassle,#Quotation
it's too much involvement#Quotation
But we're#Statement-opinion
but yet,#Uninterpretable
paying for it.#Other
Yes,#Agree/Accept
we are,#Statement-opinion
and I think of my daughter#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm sure you think of your children,#Statement-opinion
and you kind of say to yourself, what kind of future will they have when they think back and say, well, my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and maybe people are trying,#Statement-opinion
but they have to change attitudes,#Statement-opinion
And it seems to me that it's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than we had growing up#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you can really see it.#Other
I, I had a chance to go to Bolivia a couple years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
and of course there's no industry, very little trash,#Statement-non-opinion
they#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they don't even have that much that they burn, because#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they consume everything down#Other
Well, they,#Uninterpretable
to the thread,#Other
and it amazed me,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I just had totally forgotten how ...#Statement-non-opinion

Okay.#Other
Yes.#Other
Uh, well, right now we have one dog inside.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
She goes out#Statement-non-opinion
but I mean she's an indoor dog.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And two outside cats.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gosh.#Appreciation
Male and female.#Statement-non-opinion
And how long have you had them?#Wh-Question
The ma-,#Uninterpretable
the dog is probably about, about thirteen, fourteen years old.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the cats are, they might be as old.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not sure#Statement-non-opinion
Kind of lose track#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well, that's interesting because we have a simi-,#Statement-opinion
we don't have cats#Statement-non-opinion
but we do have a dog,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
who is an indoor dog,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and she is going to be thirteen this summer#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Oh, is that right?#Yes-No-Question
Yes, uh-huh.#Yes answers
What kind of dog do you have?#Wh-Question
Um, she's, um, a mix of Cockapoo, Cock-, Cocker Spaniel and Poodle.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's what ours is#Statement-non-opinion
Is that right?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Isn't that interesting ?#Backchannel in question form
.#Non-verbal
What color is your dog?#Wh-Question
White.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, ours is black,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
definitely different#Statement-non-opinion
I'll be darned.#Appreciation
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she's a female#Statement-non-opinion
and she's, um, been, she's been a really, a really good companion for me.#Statement-non-opinion
Um,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she's like a little shadow, you know, kind of,#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
follows me around all the time,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and, um, she's slowing down considerably.#Statement-non-opinion
She doesn't hear very well#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she doesn't see very well#Statement-non-opinion
but she's,#Uninterpretable
Well, that's to be expected at,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
their age.#Other
at this age, I guess so.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um, she's been a good dog to have,#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
once she's gone, I'm not sure if I'll get another animal or not#Statement-non-opinion
Well, everybody always says no more#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I, I think animals are really important in the family.#Statement-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
I agree,#Agree/Accept
yes.#Agree/Accept
Um, did you get yours as a pet for your chil-,#Yes-No-Question
do you have children?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, yeah,#Yes answers
we,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
have five.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh. Well, I was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before#Declarative Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Well, we have had, we had had, a, a dog before.#Statement-non-opinion
She was fifteen when she died.#Statement-non-opinion
My goodness.#Appreciation
And, uh, this one, we bought by accident,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Uninterpretable
a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to co-, or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
somebody,#Other
people drop things like that off,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
up there,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I said, "Gee, she sounds like a cute little dog."#Statement-non-opinion
I told the kids, "Let's go look at her"#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Go get her.#Quotation
So that's how we got her,#Statement-non-opinion
Isn't that,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
quite by accident.#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that often happens that way.#Statement-opinion
Well, we had, um, intentionally, um, planned to get a dog.#Statement-non-opinion
We had just moved into this house and, um, decided to wait about a year and then went,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then we went out then, and found one,#Other
she was in the litter,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, they were all over the place,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and she was real docile and,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
came over and just kind of sat next to us,#Other
and I thought,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's the dog for me#Other
She picked us#Quotation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so she,#Uninterpretable
and it,#Uninterpretable
what was funny was that, um, our daughter must have been,#Statement-non-opinion
let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
she must have been about eight at the time, I guess,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, she just loved this little dog,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to pieces#Other
but I think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her.#Statement-non-opinion
I think,#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she was always a little bit leery of her.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Our son, on the other hand, who was about eleven at the time, was, um, not very interested in pets,#Statement-non-opinion
but as it turned out, he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, for heaven's sake.#Appreciation
So you just never know how that works out#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
But they say it's real important for children to have pets because, uh, well, they can go and talk to them any time,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they want to and tell them anything they want to#Statement-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
nobody is going to, you know, reprimand them or,#Other
That's right.#Appreciation
know their secrets#Other
or#Uninterpretable
That,#Uninterpretable
yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're very,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
unjudgmental#Other
Yes#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, dear#Appreciation
And the nursing homes now, they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have been, I have been reading and seeing about that on television.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and how,#Uninterpretable
Our one, our one nursing home in has one.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Permanent#Statement-non-opinion
Is that right?#Yes-No-Question
He, he kind of has free run of the place, and there is some-, or somebody takes care of him.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Isn't that amazing?#Backchannel in question form
But he goes out people,#Statement-opinion
and real nice dog, uh,#Statement-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's funny how, um, how pets can kind of, um, oh, take on a certain status in certain areas.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, um, that made me think of, uh, when our daughter was looking at colleges, we visited a campus in, um, Saint Louis#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, there were several dogs on the campus#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
and, the,#Other
what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly,#Statement-non-opinion
but they didn't appear to belong to anyone.#Statement-non-opinion
And, um,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm sure someone, you know, fed them.#Other
They were healthy,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
looking dogs.#Other
But, um, our guide that day said that the la- , one woman many, many years ago had given a huge sum of money to, to the university, on the condition that there be, um, dogs just kind of left to roam aro-, around the campus.#Statement-non-opinion
Is that right?#Backchannel in question form
Which is the strangest thing I had ever heard#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because most campuses don't allow pets,#Statement-opinion
I know.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
they just do not allow them.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
I know.#Statement-opinion
That's, that's kind of great.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it really was.#Statement-opinion
It was just a nice touch,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it kind of made it seem more homey too#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um, th-,#Uninterpretable
I thought that was most unique.#Statement-opinion
And it just, you know, kind of goes along with what you were saying,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
about the dog having sort of free run of the, the nursing home.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, um, but, uh, I,#Uninterpretable
this is the only pet we've had sin-,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
you know,#Other
in all our years of marriage, um,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's been, uh, sort of a, a change for my husband because as a, a, a boy growing up, his father had dogs#Statement-non-opinion
but they were always hunting dogs,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so they were never allowed in the house, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they were always kind of,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we've ruined them#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's what he said.#Statement-non-opinion
They say ruined them#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Other
So having a pet was a little bit different for him.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, we've had a lot of different pets.#Statement-non-opinion
We had, the kids had rabbits for pets,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we also raised them for food,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
at one time.#Other
Oh, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we've had it . We've had a skunk for a pet.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my golly.#Appreciation
For more years than I want to think about#Other
.#Non-verbal
She was in the house#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gosh.#Appreciation
Isn't that interesting?#Backchannel in question form
I don't think I've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, do-, don't ever get one for a pet.#Action-directive
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They're okay,#Statement-non-opinion
but like she, uh,#Uninterpretable
they don't ever learn their name.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you can't, you could never call her and she would come to you,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you had to go chase her down.#Statement-non-opinion
I'll be darned.#Appreciation
How interesting.#Appreciation
And, uh, their eyesight, they can't see very far either.#Statement-non-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess I've heard that, uh-huh.#Statement-non-opinion
They,#Uninterpretable
be-, before we got her, everybody said, "Oh, they're just like a cat," you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, they're not#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I mean, they use the litter box.#Statement-non-opinion
That's about it .#Statement-non-opinion
Isn't that interesting?#Backchannel in question form
That's, that's really something.#Appreciation
Um, how long did you have that?#Wh-Question
Oh, my, how, how long?#Summarize/reformulate
Probably seven or eight years.#Statement-non-opinion
Goodness sake.#Appreciation
And finally, my children are the ones who said, "Mom, you've put up with that skunk long enough,"#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
we moved her to the basement,#Other
and I don't think she was there a week till the men moved her, buil-, built her a pen outside#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my gosh.#Appreciation
Isn't that funny?#Backchannel in question form
And I thought, I put up with that all those years#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and this is what it took finally#Summarize/reformulate
And,#Statement-non-opinion
That is,#Uninterpretable
we've had, we've had cats,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
stay in the house.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We had, we had two Siamese cats.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Different times.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, one of them ran off.#Statement-non-opinion
She ran off once,#Statement-non-opinion
or he, I guess it was a male, he ran off twice,#Statement-non-opinion
and the second time he never came back.#Statement-non-opinion
My goodness.#Appreciation
And we would see him, uh, several miles from our house,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he kind of moved into a woods down there.#Statement-non-opinion
I'll be.#Appreciation
And he got huge down there.#Statement-non-opinion
My goodness.#Appreciation
He really grew#Statement-non-opinion
but he,#Statement-non-opinion
That's in-,#Appreciation
he never came back.#Other
That's interesting.#Other
I, I wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat.#Statement-opinion
Well, he wasn't a whole lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He was in the house most the time,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, he did go out sometimes#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, they ma-,#Uninterpretable
it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside.#Statement-non-opinion
Is that right?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
The, the cats,#Uninterpretable
my son has a cat,#Statement-non-opinion
and the vet had told us they get strange,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if they're kept in the house all the time.#Other
And their cat was not a friendly cat,#Statement-non-opinion
it was,#Statement-non-opinion
Well.#Uninterpretable
it was not a good,#Other
I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
it got,#Uninterpretable
it was just, did get strange#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that that was right.#Statement-opinion
And since they've moved to where they are, they let the cat out.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it has improved the personality.#Statement-non-opinion

Okay, uh,#Other
what kind of hobbies do you have Lori?#Open-Question
Uh, I guess, I, uh, I like to play golf.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Where do you play golf in this area?#Wh-Question
Well, we live, uh, pretty close,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to the Mesquite Golf Course.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, we will play either out there or at Firewheel.#Statement-non-opinion
That is usually where we play,#Statement-non-opinion
but I have played you know different courses in in the Dallas area.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you, uh, do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf?#Or-Clause
Uh, both#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Not at the same time.#Statement-non-opinion
I was going to say, that could be difficult#Statement-non-opinion
No, sometimes we ride#Statement-non-opinion
and sometimes, uh, we, pull,#Statement-non-opinion
we like to, to, uh, a lot of the times just walk, uh, for the exercise.#Statement-non-opinion
But#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I find that when I ride in a cart, I play better#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it is cause I don't get as tired#Statement-opinion
I think that might be true.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't like pulling a cart on Firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path.#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Agree/Accept
and that makes me so mad#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
You know, it is like it is not going to do that much damage to the course, but apparently they think differently#Statement-opinion
That is the reason, I don't play over there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like the course, but I don't play over there because, you, they don't, uh, you know don't allow you to pull a cart.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, I don't think a cart damages the turf.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, the reason why we play over there is because its where, since we are a Garland resident, they gave us a special deal where you can get, uh, ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
a hundred dollars#Statement-non-opinion
cause it is half price what the normal green fees are.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that is why we you know play over there#Statement-non-opinion
cause we have got our card#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I guess I could use a card too.#Statement-opinion
I live, uh, very near, uh, very close to the Firewheel Golf Course.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, do you?#Backchannel in question form
So you live in Garland then.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
I live in northwest Garland.#Statement-non-opinion
Right up there near the golf course.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
well we are in south Garland,#Statement-non-opinion
but yeah, next time you go, uh, you know, check into it,#Action-directive
they have, uh,#Uninterpretable
it is just like, uh, a bus card#Statement-non-opinion
and they just punch it. You know,#Statement-non-opinion
it has got one through ten on it#Statement-non-opinion
and every time you go they just punch it for you.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, in the last two years, I have not played very much golf because I am involved in Boy Scouts.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
So, I have, uh, I have, uh, I have children#Statement-non-opinion
You must have a, a son.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Boy Scout age.#Other
I have two boys that are boy scout age,#Affirmative non-yes answers
and, uh, so#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
I am very active in Boy Scouts#Other
so I would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I#Uninterpretable
Oh well that sounds like fun too#Appreciation
but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get to use them again#Statement-non-opinion
because my boys are still right at the beginning age#Statement-non-opinion
and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you need to, uh, teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Lessons are expensive though.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well you can teach them#Statement-opinion
Well, they would probably never make it then#Reject
because I don't think, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I only took lessons for golf when I was in college.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, as a course for P E you know#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I could graduate.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, that is the only time I think I have ever really taken golf lessons#Statement-non-opinion
and that was kind of a group#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
scenario#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and not individual.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I took one lesson one other time.#Statement-non-opinion
Besides that, uh, I just, uh, try to make the club hit the ball.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I know what you mean#Statement-non-opinion
I don't want to play strike out, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I have fun doing it,#Statement-non-opinion
some, uh, you know, I have some good shots and some bad shots.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It, it is just nice to get outdoors and do something.#Statement-opinion
So you said you work, uh, in the gardens too.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you have, uh, a special flowers?#Yes-No-Question
Well flower gardens.#Other answers
I like to have,#Statement-non-opinion
matter of fact this past weekend I just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs.#Statement-non-opinion
So, those ought to be coming up around spring time#Statement-non-opinion
My wife had, uh, just put in a bunch of, I want to say, they are pansies.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
She put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they have been,#Statement-non-opinion
we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine.#Statement-opinion
Oh, they do great.#Statement-non-opinion
I put mine in probably in November.#Statement-non-opinion
That is when she did, I think.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it was November#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't do anything to mine, water them or anything#Statement-non-opinion
And they just,#Statement-non-opinion
they do really good#Statement-non-opinion
and I even had, uh, I guess it was last year or the year before, I had some out#Statement-non-opinion
and it froze#Statement-non-opinion
and the pansies looked terrible, but they came back later.#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't do anything to them#Statement-non-opinion
so they are, uh, they are good to plant in the winter time.#Statement-non-opinion
They last for a long time then.#Statement-non-opinion
So, if you start putting them, you know, you can put them out in the spring too,#Statement-non-opinion
but once it starts getting real hot#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather.#Other
Do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time?#Yes-No-Question
Will they make it through the summer sun?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot,#Statement-non-opinion
but they make it through probably winter and spring.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Well.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
I have got some of those too,#Statement-non-opinion
cause I love flowers#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that is good.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I do, I try to do some arts and crafts#Statement-non-opinion
and I love to go,#Statement-non-opinion

I don't know what the, the last thing I've done as far as car repairs go is, is change oil and filter an, and that kind of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't gotten really involved in anything, uh, extensive in car repairs in, oh, oh, probably a year or so.#Statement-non-opinion
I think the last thing I did of any significance was change the water pump on an Oldsmobile.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I had a similar thing, that I've worked on cars ever since I was, uh, a kid#Statement-non-opinion
And that was some time ago,#Statement-non-opinion
but I've gotten to the point where, uh, the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that, uh, oh, most of the cars#Statement-non-opinion
I buy, I try to buy as simple a car as possible.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know what you mean.#Appreciation
So, you know, changing the oil, changing the spark plugs#Statement-non-opinion
and most of them now, you know, you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
or fuel injected,#Collaborative Completion
and so there's,#Uninterpretable
or fuel injected#Other
so there goes the carburetor#Statement-opinion
and if the fuel injection system breaks down,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's no way in the world you're going to work on that.#Other
No#Agree/Accept
there's no way.#Agree/Accept
Somebody once said, uh, I had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it#Statement-non-opinion
and a woman asked me what that meant#Statement-non-opinion
and I said that means that I can't work on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
basically that's it.#Appreciation
You know, they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that, uh, the guys, average guys can't really go out in the, in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs, uh.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I've got, uh, an eighty-four Chevy van that's, uh, a one ton van with a camper conversion on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's got the, the, the good old three fifty,#Statement-non-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
standard engine in it.#Other
Regular gas engine,#Statement-non-opinion
and that engine I understand,#Statement-non-opinion
I can, wo-, I can actually work on that engine.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I used to have, uh, ch-, Chevy van,#Statement-non-opinion
it was a short van,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that had the, the three fifty in it.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And basically it, it was a motor#Statement-non-opinion
and you didn't have all the other junk around it,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you could get to it to work on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I had to change the water pump in that, here about a year ago.#Statement-non-opinion
And it was really fairly easy.#Statement-non-opinion
Take the grill out and the radiator out#Statement-non-opinion
and you can just stand there and work on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the hardest part about, uh, water pump changes is getting all the junk off, before you can get too it.#Statement-opinion
Well that's true#Agree/Accept
You're right, you know,#Agree/Accept
by the time you've finally got down to it,#Statement-opinion
I was hoping I could remember where all those other things went.#Statement-non-opinion
Well that's kind of the way I was,#Statement-non-opinion
I tried to remember as I took stuff off where it went,#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't think I had too many nuts and bolts left over when I got it all put back together.#Statement-non-opinion
A few years ago I had an Oldsmobile diesel#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, the,#Uninterpretable
uh, it,#Uninterpretable
after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, I bought it when we were living in Lubbock,#Statement-non-opinion
when I came back here, I brought the car back here#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I don't know, diesels got pretty unpopular#Statement-opinion
and you couldn't sell the thi-,#Statement-opinion
I mean, though for what you could get for one,#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you might as well drive it over a cliff.#Other
And, uh, the injector pump went bad#Statement-non-opinion
so I found a outfit down here to rebuild it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Other
And, uh, i-, reinstalled that#Other
and that was probably one of the most miserable things I had gotten into in a long time.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't think I'd know where to start with a diesel.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, it, you know, i-,#Uninterpretable
diesels don't require mechanics,#Statement-opinion
they require plumbers.#Statement-opinion
Well that's true.#Agree/Accept
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
I think the onl-, closest thing I've come to, to a diesel is, I've worked for a tractor repair shop, uh, when I was in high school#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we used to overhaul farm tractors basically,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they were nearly all, all diesel,#Statement-non-opinion
but as far as cars I've never, never been involved with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Well the injector nozzle and stuff in, you know, the big diesel farm tractors, you know, what are about the size of your thumb,#Statement-non-opinion
and the-,#Uninterpretable
Well, ye-, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you ca-, you can get to them.#Statement-opinion
yeah#Agree/Accept
you can get to them,#Agree/Accept
and the ones in, in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with.#Statement-non-opinion
Well I,#Uninterpretable
I've had a lot of good service out of that car,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, uh, I finally gave it to my son#Statement-non-opinion
and he drove it literally into the ground, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He was out at Tech#Statement-non-opinion
and he, he finished it off.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, I guess you're right#Agree/Accept
the, the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status.#Agree/Accept
I don't know exactly why.#Statement-non-opinion
One of the reasons is#Uninterpretable
I, I'm beginning to wonder is, where do you get gas at.#Rhetorical-Questions
I su-,#Uninterpretable
I don't know if it's still, uh, limited like it was,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
I don't notice it, probably because I don-,#Statement-non-opinion
What,#Wh-Question
the availability?#Yes-No-Question
Huh?#Signal-non-understanding
You mean the diesel availability?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I don't, I don't notice#Statement-non-opinion
but maybe because I'm not looking for it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well I'd bought, uh, a G M C diesel pickup and, uh, loved that thing, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I really liked it.#Statement-non-opinion
But it turns out a pickup wasn't what I really needed,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it was the van that I needed then, to buy the, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
traded it in on the Chevy van.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, sure enjoyed it.#Statement-non-opinion
But yo-, you got the, the three fifty in the van?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah#Yes answers
the three fifty regular gas engine.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's what I like because, they've got plenty of power,#Statement-opinion
and, uh,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you treat them right, they're not the gas guzzlers I think that they've got the reputation to be.#Other
I'm convinced that, uh, Detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake,#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
co-,#Uninterpretable
years ago when they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm convinced that the small V eight like the, the Mustang's original two eighty-nine or some of the Chevy two eighty-threes,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
were good little V eight engines that were not gas guzzlers#Other
but they had enough power t-, pull all this weight.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the four cylinders just don't have it.#Statement-opinion
I think that little, the little Chevy V eight when it started out in sixty, in fifty-five, I think was two sixty-five, something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Little, you know, not whole lot more than the, than the, than the six cylinder that I think was like about two thirty-five or so.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a four hundred, small block four hundred that was, uh, the same block, you know, just, just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more, an.#Statement-opinion
I think those gu-, those little V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines, if they would have gone with it,#Statement-opinion
but.#Uninterpretable
Well that was, uh, that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The two little cars I've got now,#Statement-non-opinion
bought a Mitsubishi Mirage here a couple of years ago#Statement-non-opinion
and, and it was normally carbureted#Statement-non-opinion
and it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's kind of like,#Uninterpretable
and you know changing the plugs and stuff.#Other
the, the first, well my first car was a fifty-six Mustang#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, over the years, uh, all#Uninterpretable
I had a, uh, Dodge pickup several years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I can't remember the size of the engine#Statement-non-opinion
it was a three oh, seven or something like that,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, I remember working on those cars,#Statement-non-opinion
you'd open the hood#Statement-non-opinion
and there was basically nothing in there but an engine,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a few things.#Other
Now, you open the hood and it's scary.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes.#Agree/Accept
The friend of ours over here, he's got, uh, sixty-five, or sixty-six Mustang the six cylinder.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I was look under the hood of that the other day#Statement-non-opinion
and like you say, you can see the road.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's amazing.#Statement-opinion
Well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to.#Statement-opinion
You coul-, yeah, you could stand in there if you really wanted to, I guess.#Statement-opinion
My dad's got a new, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess it's an eighty-nine or ninety, uh, Chrysler something or other.#Statement-non-opinion
It's one of those transverse mounted V sixes, front wheel drive.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, he was showing it to me#Statement-non-opinion
and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, you can see the three spark plugs there in the front.#Statement-non-opinion
And I said well where are the other three.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And he'd never really thought about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he says well, hopefully I won't have to change them, before I trade it off.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well when they went to the,#Uninterpretable
started with the newer engines, you know,#Statement-opinion
when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much, you know, trouble. Because the three fifty with all the, you know,#Statement-opinion
like well, actually, I guess, her-,#Uninterpretable
within a couple of years ago anyway was the last I've paid any attention to it.#Statement-non-opinion
The three oh five was that, that,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
V eight that they put in the, the three quarter and, and half ton van.#Other
And it had all the air pump and, uh, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know, all that, all that stuff.#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the anti-smog pumps.#Statement-non-opinion
And all the anti-smog stuff.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, boy that was, uh, really a mess back under there under the, in that van.#Statement-non-opinion
And all that stuff loads the motor down.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
So it's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things.#Statement-opinion
But that's one good thing#Statement-opinion
I've got a, uh, eight ninety, uh, Chevy Blazer now#Statement-non-opinion
and it's got one, uh, belt on it a serpentine belt.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, it's that one that's about, uh, what an inch and a half wide.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Got a bunch of groves in it.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
I haven't had to replace the thing yet.#Statement-non-opinion
It looks like it would be, uh, better than having,#Statement-non-opinion
I've got an, an Olds Toronado that, I think's got six belts on the sucker.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I had to get all those off, you know, when I was replace that, uh, water pump.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck.#Statement-opinion
You know, when one of them breaks,#Statement-opinion
Oh man.#Appreciation
it's not the outside one,#Other
it's, it's the, it's usually that power steering be-,#Statement-opinion
or something that's way back in there.#Statement-opinion
You bet,#Appreciation
everything else's got to come off first.#Statement-opinion
Everything's got to come off.#Agree/Accept
Well, it's a pleasure meeting you.#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
and we'll, uh,#Uninterpretable
how many times have you done this now?#Conventional-closing
Is this,#Uninterpretable
Uh, I've got, uh, five stickers here from T I,#Conventional-closing
so I guess I've done probably, uh, I'd say seven or eight of them.#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
I hadn't, uh, hadn't, not gotten any calls here in the last, uh,#Conventional-closing
this is the first one in a week or so.#Conventional-closing
Yeah,#Conventional-closing
I haven't gotten any calls in two weeks,#Conventional-closing
so I don't know, if, if it's tapering off, or what.#Conventional-closing
If ta-, it's winding down or what.#Conventional-closing
I had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting, uh, answers.#Conventional-closing
Finding a taker.#Conventional-closing
So it sounds,#Uninterpretable
it's taken them ten, fifteen minutes at a time,#Conventional-closing
so, people are either not,#Conventional-closing
no-,#Uninterpretable
maybe they're burnt out or,#Conventional-closing
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Yeah, well.#Conventional-closing
Anyway let you go.#Conventional-closing
Thanks for talking.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
all right.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay.#Other
Great.#Appreciation
Um, currently, I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm mainly do a lot of walking.#Statement-non-opinion
I have a son that's a little bit overweight#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around.#Statement-non-opinion
So my wife and I kind of take turns.#Statement-non-opinion
At one time I had a fairly regular exercise program.#Statement-non-opinion
But, in the last couple of months I've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down.#Statement-non-opinion
All this space that normally would be dedicated towards the,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
exercise area, is covered in boxes.#Other
Um, what did you do when you did exercise regularly?#Wh-Question
Well, I had, uh, a little routine that I did for warm ups.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then I did some very mild, say, light weight lifting.#Statement-non-opinion
Nothing,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not trying to make big bulging muscles,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, right now, um, I try when it's nice out,#Statement-non-opinion
it's been raining a lot this spring,#Statement-non-opinion
but I try to, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I have a bicycle#Statement-non-opinion
and I like to cycle a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, my husband and I, we have entered a few rallies, that's pretty popular in Texas,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if it's up north,#Other
but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally#Statement-non-opinion
and thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles, which that's a lot of fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that.#Statement-non-opinion
And, um, T I, where I work has, uh, a fitness center#Statement-non-opinion
so a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends, we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine, that are fun to ride and workout on.#Statement-non-opinion
So I try to,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis.#Statement-non-opinion
I used to, uh, get into it and get out of it based on my schedule,#Statement-non-opinion
so I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's a big commitment.#Statement-opinion
We don't have any kids yet#Statement-non-opinion
so, that's a lot of, part of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's a plus.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I have a total of five children.#Statement-non-opinion
I have three left living at home.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they do take up a big part of my, uh, my evening and weekend.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
That's why, they, uh, really stress, at T I, they really stress, staying in shape, like stay in fit, overall fitness, you know, no smoking and all that.#Statement-non-opinion
But it's hard to find, uh, an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, you know, because like I know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't know if that would work for me because I don't know I wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain.#Statement-non-opinion
But it's really hard to find something that works, and, you know, to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever.#Statement-opinion
I think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You have to,#Statement-opinion
what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you can use what ever rationale you want,#Statement-opinion
but basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, you know, if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, well, then I'll around a lot longer,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now, well, you know, get the enjoyment of me, years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have taken it.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I've been learning a lot lately about, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if you're familiar with him#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really.#Statement-non-opinion
He's, he's, kind of, he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, he was talking about the three things you could, that cause aging smoking are inactivity, * mistranscribed? listen#Statement-non-opinion
and what was the other one, I think was, yeah, obesity.#Statement-non-opinion
If you can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, you know, cause those are risk factors,#Statement-non-opinion
so anyway,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's kind of a tip.#Other
Oh, I've done a lot of study over the years#Statement-non-opinion
and I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water.#Statement-non-opinion
Really#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, the research that I've done#Statement-non-opinion
and I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, it's amazing, that, uh, you know, prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There were none prior to nineteen-hundred.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water. In nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities,#Statement-non-opinion
and after that we,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
we started having the hearts attacks#Other
and, uh, Dr. Price wrote a book CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL, AND CHLORINE.#Statement-non-opinion
You can usually find it in a health food store.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know they had it in health food stores in Plano,#Statement-non-opinion
I used live in Plano.#Statement-non-opinion
Dr. Price?#Signal-non-understanding
Uh, Dr. Price,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
And it's amazing,#Statement-non-opinion
he makes the,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, it's a very small book#Statement-non-opinion
and the guys very opinionated,#Statement-non-opinion
um, but he makes a very good case against chlorine.#Statement-non-opinion
There were no heart attacks before we started using it#Statement-non-opinion
and he points out that people in, uh, England#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks.#Statement-non-opinion
That's really interesting.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis, which is the,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
clogging of the arteries.#Other
And, uh, you know, he's,#Uninterpretable
there's been a lot of reports since then.#Statement-non-opinion
This whole thing about,#Statement-non-opinion
first it was stress, then it went to cholesterol,#Statement-non-opinion
and now they're saying what's cholesterol,#Statement-non-opinion
well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, it's amazing what he points out in that book#Statement-non-opinion
and, in fact, he, everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency, who did work back in nineteen eighty-six, who wrote a letter to Dr. Price in nineteen eighty-seven. And in this letter he praised Dr. Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis.#Statement-non-opinion
And, E P A never published that report.#Statement-non-opinion
And what's the name of this book again?#Wh-Question
CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE.#Statement-non-opinion
I'll have to remember that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That will be very interesting.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon#Statement-non-opinion
so, he's really interested in the heart.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he's, in fact, he's a, well, heart, too,#Statement-non-opinion
he's, uh, he's done a lot of research on like how your heart reacts to exercise#Statement-non-opinion
Sorry,#Apology
he made me laugh.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, so anyway,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There is, there is a lot of good information out there, uh, about health.#Statement-non-opinion
And a lot of the, a lot of the myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because that's, that's good for you,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, but to believe some of the things,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, and I don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet,#Statement-non-opinion
but to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is, is just hard to believe.#Statement-opinion
If you get a chance read Dr. Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's a real good,#Statement-opinion
um, he talks about that.#Statement-non-opinion
Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I actually eat pretty much anything that I want.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I've had my cholesterol checked and, uh, a few times#Statement-non-opinion
and I've never been above, like, you know, one-hundred and fifty,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
never.#Other
And, uh, uh, I mean, I,#Uninterpretable
You have a good ratio of good to bad.#Statement-opinion
Um,#Downplayer
Cholesterol.#Other
Well, what they tell me,#Other
but, I mean, you know, everything is like within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing#Statement-opinion
You know, they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, we've,#Uninterpretable
I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley, Maryland.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we've had a few of the health fairs up here#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, you know, I've always come out aces.#Statement-non-opinion
That's good.#Appreciation
You know, I'm not really that big on watching what I eat,#Statement-non-opinion
but I do eat, you know, some health cookies that are high in fiber,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
low in fat and all that kind of stuff.#Other
But, I mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine, I'm not, cholesterol, I'm not worried about it.#Statement-non-opinion

Well, I am new to Texas,#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't even know what the law is,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh?#Backchannel in question form
in the state,#Other
do you?#Backchannel in question form
Well, yes,#Yes answers
of course, we do have capital punishment.#Statement-non-opinion
And we've, you know, done away with our, quote, fair share number.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's right,#Appreciation
I think now, that I recall, reading about it in the paper.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, you know, different things,#Uninterpretable
is it restricted to certain crimes?#Yes-No-Question
Or just,#Uninterpretable
Yes,#Yes answers
it's certain crimes, uh, capital crimes, murder, of course, uh, rape,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this sort of thing.#Other
Um. Well.#Uninterpretable
It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get into the system.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know,#Statement-opinion
the one thing that I think is really sad about it, as I recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if, if people who have been there, are going to be killed. Um, there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent#Statement-opinion
and, they want,#Uninterpretable
I mean they're anxious for someone to be killed#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just,#Uninterpretable
I can't see that.#Statement-non-opinion
That happens on occasion,#Statement-opinion
it sure does,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
has affected you personally.#Other
You know, I don't know,#Hedge
or a person personally.#Statement-opinion
No.#Reject
I think I would be, you know,#Statement-opinion
I guess, really if I had to say yes or no, I guess I would say, you know, that I am in certain cases, in favor of the death penalty,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know that it's a big deterrent really.#Statement-opinion
I don't know that it is.#Statement-opinion
I don't know how we'd ever find out, you know, really whether it is or not.#Statement-opinion
Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it kee-,#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
oh, absolutely,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
it goes on for years and years, and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, taxpayer money.#Statement-opinion
Ye-,#Uninterpretable
it's really sad.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
I just think, um,#Statement-opinion
somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than, than, um, expecting,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the feeling that it#Other
with,#Uninterpretable
someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yes, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Is really kind of bad#Statement-opinion
Yes#Agree/Accept
it is.#Statement-opinion
It's a tough, tough question.#Statement-opinion
It really is.#Statement-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
I suspect I would be, uh, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know, one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that.#Statement-opinion
Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might be by it.#Statement-opinion
That's true#Other
and there really are criminals that are hard-core and,#Statement-opinion
Oh, absolutely.#Agree/Accept
repeat, and never have any chance for,#Other
Tha-, that's right.#Appreciation
Oh, I don't know,#Hedge
is it,#Uninterpretable
do you feel at all like, it's a religious issue?#Yes-No-Question
Not with me personally.#Negative non-no answers
It is with a lot of other people.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's not, not to me personally,#Statement-non-opinion
no.#Yes answers
Um.#Uninterpretable
No.#Yes answers
I don't know,#Hedge
sometimes I feel,#Uninterpretable
I mean I do go to church and things.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know how I would feel about it.#Statement-non-opinion
But like you say, if it hit you personally,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
closer at home you would feel,#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
feel differently.#Other
That's a, it's a tough, tough question,#Statement-opinion
it really is.#Statement-opinion
Do you think most states have that#Yes-No-Question
or?#Uninterpretable
Yes,#Yes answers
I think most states do have capital punishment.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Yes answers
Uh-huh, huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do.#Statement-opinion
That still does it,#Summarize/reformulate
that's right.#Appreciation
Yes,#Agree/Accept
they're only,#Uninterpretable
I was reading something about it the other day,#Statement-non-opinion
I think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have capital punishment still.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A lot of them had to have el-, elected not to do so.#Statement-opinion
Now I don't know, what they do in place of it.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, maybe it's life in prisonment or, you know, something,#Statement-opinion
I don-, I don't know how they handle it#Statement-non-opinion
bu-, I was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment.#Statement-non-opinion
Have that.#Summarize/reformulate
Well, and it doesn't seem like very many people, uh, are really, I mean,#Statement-opinion
there's a lot of people that are on death row.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But there's not very many people that actually, um. do get killed.#Other
Yes,#Agree/Accept
a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, it seems like a of people live there,#Statement-opinion
and then through appeals.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I know they do frequently,#Statement-opinion
I mean they cover, cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If it finally gets to that point.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the first appeal is automatic,#Statement-opinion
so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There's, there's a lot of, you know, last minute, uh, things that happen cause a person not to,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
have to go through the whole thing.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So is it, uh,#Uninterpretable
are we doing lethal injection now?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
uh-huh.#Yes answers
That's, that's fairly recent, I don't know, how recent, but fairly recent, in the state of Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Before that, it was, uh, death by electrocution.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
wh-, which seems so awful.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it certainly does.#Statement-non-opinion
So, it's a little bit more humane,#Statement-opinion
I guess, it is,#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it would almost have to be, I suppose.#Statement-opinion
If you, if you had to chose, I guess I would, I am sure I would take the lethal injection.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
the other one just seems so terrible.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
absolutely.#Agree/Accept
Um.#Uninterpretable
It's a, it's a tough question.#Statement-opinion
It really is.#Statement-opinion
I guess, if I had to say yes or no, I would say, you know, yes.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I would have to lean toward capital punishment, you know, for certain crimes.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime#Yes-No-Question
or, it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison?#Or-Clause
No,#No answers
I don't think it's a monetary thing.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think,#Uninterpretable
we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of determ-, deterrent or, you know, an eye for an eye type thing, or something like that.#Statement-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
Some of the crimes are just so brutal and so, you know, useless.#Statement-opinion
This may seem to be the best way out.#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Easiest way out maybe.#Summarize/reformulate
No,#No answers
I don't think it's a monetary thing.#Statement-opinion
Um. Well, um, and I notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area#Statement-non-opinion
It's,#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
especially the murder rate, its just gone crazy.#Statement-non-opinion
It's kind of been scary,#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to think about it#Other
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
And you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that.#Other
Yes,#Agree/Accept
I wish I had the answer for that,#Statement-non-opinion
everybody does.#Statement-opinion
You hate to have the dubious honor of being, you know, so high in the,#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it's nothing to be proud of,#Statement-opinion
in statistics,#Other
certainly not.#Statement-opinion
But I, you know,#Uninterpretable
we have been really fortunate#Statement-non-opinion
our family,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
hasn't had any crime.#Other
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so have we been very, very fortunate.#Statement-non-opinion
And, so we don't,#Uninterpretable
it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
And how they would expect,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
how they would hope,#Other
I mean you, you hear of people who have, um, committed crimes, and then they get out of jail and they go, and they do the same thing again.#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you wonder why they can't just stop it.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's right.#Appreciation
So, maybe you would,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone.#Statement-non-opinion
So would I,#Agree/Accept
I fortunately, I have never been in that circumstance,#Statement-non-opinion
I hope I never am, like, like everybody else.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
I know when, um,#Uninterpretable
we just, we moved here, uh, I from the, I got a summons, jury summons,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just like constantly, it seemed like,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but fortunately I had small children#Statement-non-opinion
and I didn't have to go.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's not that,#Statement-opinion
I mean, I think everyone should have to serve on the jury,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's just that, I didn't,#Statement-non-opinion
I hate having to be in charge of someone else's life.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure,#Agree/Accept
it's, it's a big responsibility,#Statement-opinion
it really is.#Statement-opinion
And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
involving a violent crime or anything.#Other
So would I.#Statement-non-opinion
That would be really awful.#Appreciation
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
Well, anyway, I sure have enjoyed, uh, talking to you about this. Although it has been difficult#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh.#Uninterpretable
It is, it's a tough subject,#Statement-opinion
it really is.#Statement-opinion
I'd hate to decide it, but I guess, uh, guess it's important,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that we decide as a people what, what we're going to do.#Other
That's right.#Appreciation
Anyway, well, you have a good day.#Conventional-closing
Well, thank you,#Conventional-closing
it's nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Thank you,#Conventional-closing

Do you?#Yes-No-Question
Have you?#Yes-No-Question

Yes,#Yes answers
uh-huh.#Yes answers
Uh, no,#No answers
not actually#Negative non-no answers
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
well, yes I do.#Yes answers
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
In fact, I am at work right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and so let me take the lead, uh, Angela.#Offers, Options Commits
Uh, I think what is really important, uh,#Statement-opinion
of course, salary is very important, because that's why you are working for your, for the money, but, job satisfaction to me is also, uh, very important in having a job.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, one of the things that, uh, she asked us to discuss was benefits.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
And so we could, we could talk about, uh, that path, you know, how important you think his benefits are. And, and, and, uh, how important you think they are and if, what would you like to see increased#Action-directive
Okay.#Agree/Accept
in his benefits.#Other
Like, uh, perhaps, uh, he has, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family, uh, uh, and how much coverage, uh, it provides and also, your hospital coverage, and, uh, um, probably dental.#Other
How important you think that would be.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
I, I think that job wise benefits are import-, just as important as salary is.#Statement-opinion
Because they, of course, if you did not have them, you would be pulling from your salary, of course.#Summarize/reformulate
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
Right,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
Especially when you have a family, with children, and you are always going to the doctor for,#Statement-opinion
And they always have surprises for you.#Summarize/reformulate
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
With children,#Repeat-phrase
they always do.#Statement-opinion
You know, and so, it's, it is, uh,#Uninterpretable
we could not do without the benefit package from, from any company that we worked for, whether they be a conglomerate or just a small, uh, uh, business.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think any, any, even if your insurance policy is not the greatest.#Statement-opinion
You would still have something.#Collaborative Completion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
You you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time#Summarize/reformulate
Right.#Agree/Accept
just by yourself.#Other
Also, for working women#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
uh, I think a lot of the companies should start providing for day-care in the, in the,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the building.#Other
They are getting a handle on that, in fact, uh, my oldest daughter is, uh, is uh, a nurse#Statement-non-opinion
and she just received her masters degree#Statement-non-opinion
and she is now into consulting#Statement-non-opinion
and that's one of the areas that she is working on. To have, uh, uh, a day care center for the indiv-, the children of the, of the nurses that are staffing the facility.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that is true in many, many areas of, you know, uh, job titles#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and professions.#Other
Like in may case, I have three children *#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
from ages nine to two.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that I would,#Other
Would,#Uninterpretable
it would,#Summarize/reformulate
be making would be going to day care.#Other
It would be just futile.#Other
And it would be just,#Statement-non-opinion
And they would not have the quality,#Summarize/reformulate
basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care,#Statement-non-opinion
And they,#Summarize/reformulate
center.#Other
would be deprived of their mother.#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No,#Other
I understand that totally#Appreciation
Besides which, it would be easier, uh, there's a lot of single mothers out there now, from divorces and a lot of,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I hear ,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
women are starting to have babies without a partner.#Other
Yes,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
And to go to work, you are worried about your child, besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
And if they were in the same building#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then you are going to the same place,#Other
and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child,#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Do you,#Yes-No-Question
or, you know, and take your breaks with your children, or something.#Other
Do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit, if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting?#Other
.#Non-verbal
Do you think that would be,#Yes-No-Question
I think tha-,#Statement-opinion
I,#Affirmative non-yes answers
acceptable?#Other
think it would be fair.#Other
I do too.#Agree/Accept
I think if, if the company could not provide it all on their own,#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
that you,#Uninterpretable
for the, for the people that would be using it, you know,#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
a certain amount of their salary would go to it.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
But it would still probably be cheaper#Statement-opinion
With the company than,#Collaborative Completion
with the company helping,#Other
than having to go,#Other
our if everybody, you know, pulled their own weight in it.#Other
That's ,#Uninterpretable
that's right.#Agree/Accept
Yes,#Agree/Accept
I,#Agree/Accept
I think it would be really.#Statement-opinion
agree with that.#Other
really great.#Other
That would be fair.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do.#Agree/Accept
Uh, and how, how do you feel about, uh, let's see, eye care?#Open-Question
Eye care is good.#Statement-opinion
I do not,#Statement-non-opinion
I am not sur-,#Statement-non-opinion
I do not think we have that on our policy.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, we,#Uninterpretable
Vision, I guess it's called,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
vision care.#Other
It would be great, I mean, uh, the glasses that,#Statement-opinion
the exams themselves are not expensive, it's the glasses.#Statement-opinion
It depends on who ha-, examines your eyes.#Dispreferred answers
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
If you have an, an optometrist or an ophthalmologist,#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
now like my ...#Uninterpretable
there's a vast difference in those two, uh,#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
professionals.#Other
Well, like my mother, she has to go for testing cause she has got,#Statement-non-opinion
Glaucoma.#Collaborative Completion
Well, she does not have it,#Reject
but,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she is like, on the verge of it or,#Other
Oh, okay,#Response Acknowledgement
so,#Uninterpretable
something.#Other
Her eyes are changing,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and she has to be tested periodically.#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and those are expensive tests.#Other
Yes,#Agree/Accept
they are.#Agree/Accept
Now, I think your insurance covers her#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on that,#Other
but you know, for something like that, it-, that's just as bad as a medical, you know,#Statement-opinion
that's,#Uninterpretable
Right,#Agree/Accept
that's critical, because she's in need of it so often.#Summarize/reformulate
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yes,#Agree/Accept
and, you know, we have, uh, needs in our life that are unique to us#Statement-opinion
and, uh, you know, people have needs in their life that unique to us, to them.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
I mean, we are all different#Statement-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Now, I would like to see betl-, better dental insurance to me.#Statement-non-opinion
Was that our beep?#Yes-No-Question
Well, no#No answers
that's my other phone.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, that's it#Statement-non-opinion
that's okay,#Statement-non-opinion
my,#Uninterpretable
that phone is ringing to an empty desk#Statement-non-opinion
and she's on vacation,#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
so, it's okay.#Statement-non-opinion
But, with the three children#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, orthopedic care, um, not orthopedic, orthodontic care,#Other
That's very expensive.#Statement-opinion
because on, on a lot of the dental insurance, they do not cover that well.#Statement-non-opinion
For the, the orthodontia stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
Orthodontic work is terribly expensive.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Agree/Accept
Especially when you have a lot of problems with the children teeth,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and you have to really get them when they are young, in order to have, uh, not, uh, a decent smile when they are fifteen, sixteen years old.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
I know, two of my daughters had to have that#Statement-non-opinion
and they started having extractions at age eight, uh, because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we footed the bill, because there was not any such thing and when they were young.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
My middle child needs to have, uh, orthodontic, he's because his, his pallet is squared, not rounded.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it affects his speech a little bit, not, not anything, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
major.#Collaborative Completion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But just enough that his bite is off a little bit#Statement-non-opinion
and it's like four hundred dollars,#Statement-non-opinion
and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I tell you I, I just read an article in the paper about what they are doing, I think it was an ad in, in our publication at Texas Instruments, where they are breaking the jaw and,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and lining the jaw up with the teeth.#Other
It's, it's less painful and less expensive.#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
That sounds like it would hurt more.#Statement-opinion
I, I know,#Agree/Accept
but it, it's, it's, uh, easier on the patient in the long run,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gosh.#Appreciation
which amazed me.#Other
I, I would much rather that, do that,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to myself than make my five year old go in and do it.#Other
.#Non-verbal
That would kill me.#Statement-non-opinion

What is it about, nursing homes?#Wh-Question
Uh-, well, about nursing homes,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and older people.#Other
Uh, my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they're just really close here.#Statement-non-opinion
And his mother has bad health too#Statement-non-opinion
and so I go over sometimes in the day when he's at work#Statement-non-opinion
and I, um, help with her and bathe her and feed her.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, and I, that's hard to be a caretaker I really believe.#Statement-opinion
It's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty-four hours a day.#Statement-opinion
Oh, it's very difficult#Agree/Accept
I know.#Agree/Accept
Uh, i-, she has Alzheimer's and does not remember, uh, a lot#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if anything.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so she asks the same questions over and over again. Which is not un-, you know, unrealistic.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I, uh,#Uninterpretable
some nights his mother calls me and says can your family,#Statement-non-opinion
and just bring the kids in the family#Quotation
and just come over and, and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented.#Quotation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
how old is she?#Wh-Question
She's ninety-two.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, my, see my father is ninety-two#Statement-non-opinion
and still, uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I think that's wonderful.#Statement-opinion
and do the whole thing,#Other
but you know if something would, uh, whenever something happens to one of them then,#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
I don't know what I'll do up there.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes#Statement-non-opinion
and so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I was just going to say.#Statement-non-opinion
They're in Missouri#Statement-non-opinion
and I could, I, I know, I know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, well, they can't take the proper care of them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Most of them.#Other
Um,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, it's, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, uh, don't have a pla-, really don't have a place to go.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
So,#Uninterpretable
Uh, I think it's wonderful these, these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily#Statement-opinion
but they can go and reside there like little apartments,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
places in between places.#Other
And I like that idea if they can handle it themselves.#Statement-non-opinion
Um,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's one very close to where my parents are#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I think it would be nice#Statement-non-opinion
but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, I mean, he's from that old depression era#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, you know, it's, oh, it's just blissfull that they're both,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
able to do everything for themselves.#Other
I would imagine that I'll, uh, if something happens, I'll move one of them or bot-, you know, in, in with me.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is#Statement-non-opinion
and, but I think you'd have to really,#Statement-opinion
they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Nursing homes.#Collaborative Completion
on this homes.#Other
But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a,#Statement-non-opinion
Visit.#Collaborative Completion
I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.#Statement-opinion
They don't go and see them.#Agree/Accept
That's right.#Agree/Accept
They never go to see them.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
I've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even,#Statement-non-opinion
maybe, maybe Christmas.#Statement-opinion
You know, um, I, I think nursing homes are, are, um, some are good#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have to say that.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I do too.#Agree/Accept
Um,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or if, i-, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
Uh, because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing ho-, homes, uh, regulation in Texas#Statement-non-opinion
so maybe we'll get it improved.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
I hope so.#Statement-non-opinion
Anyway.#Uninterpretable
You know, it's, I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to have them go there.#Other
Oh, it's tough I'm sure.#Agree/Accept
And then if you find out that they are not having good care, you know, I'm sure that it is just,#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast.#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
that would be devastating I'm sure#Statement-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
And, uh, and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker I don't, uh,#Statement-opinion
it's a very, very hard decision I think.#Statement-opinion
It is a tough decision#Agree/Accept
and it's one that needs a great deal of thought,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and prior probably.#Other
I think that's right,#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now I know a friend of mine who had a father, uh, she brought to her home, uh, to live there,#Statement-non-opinion
but he needed the medical treatment#Statement-non-opinion
and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to, to help him out.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that might be a partial solution,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or something.#Other
But, um, I personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before I think I'd ever,#Statement-non-opinion
I would hope we could do that,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then go from there.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, anyway,#Uninterpretable
Well, I, I think we kind of are along the same lines.#Statement-opinion
We've covered a little bit#Statement-opinion
and, uh, it's good to hear from you#Conventional-closing
and,#Uninterpretable
Good to hear from you.#Conventional-closing
Have a good,#Conventional-closing
Have a lovely day.#Conventional-closing
Have a good lif-,#Conventional-closing

Wha-, what sort of company do you work for?#Wh-Question
Do you work for a big or a little place?#Or-Clause
Uh, I work for Georgia Tech.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes sir.#Other
I work for the research facility.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and it's, it's kind of small in a sense#Statement-non-opinion
but it, it does have, about, uh, I guess, two thousand civil employees.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, on a, a scale, I guess it's still considered small.#Statement-opinion
It just have a lot of different laboratories.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The area I work in, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that's make up most of the laboratory#Statement-non-opinion
so from, from that standpoint, it's pretty small#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's pretty small.#Other
What about yourself?#Open-Question
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I, I work for, uh, actually probably similar kind of place.#Statement-non-opinion
I work for, uh, Lincoln Laboratory.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Uh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and, uh,#Uninterpretable
so we're, we're part, we're actually part of M I T.#Statement-non-opinion
So it's very much the same kind of place and, uh#Statement-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the technical institution.#Other
Right. Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what, uh, uh, what things were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. I guess, uh, list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the working conditions, things like that.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know.#Hedge
What are your, uh, what sorts of things would you consider important?#Wh-Question
Well those and probably the security aspect of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, uh, you're treated,#Statement-non-opinion
and it may not be true in every place.#Hedge
In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a, a person.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people and, and, you know, their well being as far as, you know, how they going, their next dollar going to come in.#Statement-opinion
How they going to pay their bills.#Rhetorical-Questions
They just lay them off.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I think the company still exists.#Statement-non-opinion
What they use to do is, they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
That way that, you know, one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, you know, I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, you know, other than s-, you know, something like,#Statement-opinion
unemployment is good#Statement-opinion
but I mean the company as a whole#Statement-non-opinion
because you as an employee, even the company is making money,#Statement-non-opinion
they paying you a salary#Statement-non-opinion
but you are responsible for that company growth.#Statement-opinion
You're responsible also for helping that company get to the par-, point that it's at at making profits.#Statement-opinion
So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know. Because it's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know.#Statement-opinion
I don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of com-, a company situation.#Statement-opinion
Now how do you mean that?#Open-Question
I know it,#Uninterpretable
Well in a sense that say, how do you make a, a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people.#Declarative Wh-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, for the bad times of the company.#Other
What about the, the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well.#Declarative Wh-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know. In that standpoint.#Uninterpretable
Well, you, you think it's better than to, to try to spread the, the effort equally among all the employees of the company#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Ye-, yes,#Yes answers
I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I really do.#Statement-non-opinion
I think it'd be better that way#Statement-opinion
and even at that, it would at least give the person time to look for another job because#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they know that that there are problems#Other
and, you know, there are reason to look for another job#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
instead of just dumping it on them all at one time.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know. That's just, that's my views, you know.#Hedge
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that.#Statement-non-opinion
I think, uh, back about, a few years ago when things were tough, Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile.#Statement-non-opinion
They went to a, uh, a, a four and a half day work week rather#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than cut, yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, have to, give everybody a half day a week off.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think you can do that for a little while#Statement-opinion
but I'm,#Uninterpretable
Well at least that would give a person a chance to look#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know. Because the way it is, a person really don't have a chance#Other

Okay,#Other
what kind of ex-,#Wh-Question
do you have children?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
we have one that's seventeen, one that's fifteen, and one that's just now six.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
And we had kind of a hard time finding someplace we could put Michael's goods ,#Statement-non-opinion
his birthday is the first of September,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he was going to school at five.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, he started the first grade when he was five#Statement-non-opinion
or,#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
started,#Other
yeah,#Uninterpretable
first grade when he was five years old.#Statement-non-opinion
And you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, we could, you know,#Uninterpretable
we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
mediocre expensive,#Other
it wasn't really that expensive,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something.#Statement-opinion
To learn something.#Collaborative Completion
And that's, I mean, that's#Uninterpretable
even not only toddlers but, you know, even your older children.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's hard to find anywhere they're really going to learn something.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well,#Uninterpretable
And then, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you do have to pay, you know, if you,#Statement-non-opinion
the better the place, the more you're going to pay.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but parents pay when they stay home with them anyway#Statement-opinion
True,#Agree/Accept
very true.#Agree/Accept
It's,#Uninterpretable
You know, my wife works#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the baby-sitter#Other
so. We try to,#Statement-non-opinion
If I had any children I would, uh, I hope that I'll be in a position to stay home with my child because I'm not real, uh, uh, trusting of a lot of people,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
see I don't know,#Hedge
uh, especially today.#Other
People,#Uninterpretable
I work in the news business#Statement-non-opinion
and I just see different things all the time,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and people are just crazy these days.#Statement-opinion
They're crazy#Statement-opinion
and,#Hedge
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I don't, you know,#Other
it takes me a, takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
much less to, you know, trust someone with my, with my child.#Other
Well, see we took our time#Statement-non-opinion
and we checked it out,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we found a preschool for him.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it, you know,#Uninterpretable
through other folks where I, where I work,#Statement-non-opinion
I work at T I.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool#Statement-non-opinion
it was actually at a licensed preschool,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
we, had those requirements,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so,#Uninterpretable
I guess that's the best way, you know, to get,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
recommendations from your friends or,#Other
I know,#Appreciation
I'm,#Uninterpretable
well,#Uninterpretable
family members.#Other
that#Uninterpretable
and, you know, I don't think I would have left him anywhere that would,#Statement-opinion
I would have stayed home with him first,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
before I left him somewhere that, you know,#Other
they still have unlicensed baby-sitters running around up here#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, I just, I, I don't think I'd take that chance.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, I think it's out of sight or out of mind,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for less than,#Other
I mean you have to be, you've got to be sure,#Statement-opinion
for more than,#Other
that these people,#Other
a minute or so.#Other
I mean not that they're going to abuse your child or anything,#Statement-opinion
But you never know.#Collaborative Completion
but you just have to be sure that they're going to be watching them, you know,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that they wouldn't let them drink something or, you know, eat something off the floor,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
just simple things,#Statement-non-opinion
But you, you know,#Uninterpretable
as,#Statement-opinion
that can be harmful.#Other
as far as child abuse is these days you never know,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you don't know who you can trust,#Summarize/reformulate
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and who you can't, you know.#Other
Then you hear so much, you know, on the news about, uh, child care places#Statement-non-opinion
and also, um, senior care facilities, you know, you hear abuse.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
senior care, is getting real bad.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so you just, you just don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
and you almost want to, you know, spend a couple of weeks with, in class with your child just to see how it is or something.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But,#Uninterpretable
So, you have no children at all.#Summarize/reformulate
No,#No answers
I don't.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#No answers
Gee.#Appreciation
No.#No answers
I'm,#Uninterpretable
Do you miss that part in your life#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Uh, no,#No answers
I'm only, I'm twenty-three#Statement-non-opinion
so I,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
still have a little bit of time,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, it's just not in the cards for me right now#Statement-non-opinion
I'm trying to get my career going.#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Uninterpretable
I imagine,#Appreciation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
working in the news production,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
anyway back to the subject,#Action-directive
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
we should have discussed this earlier,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but anyway, it's tough,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it really is,#Statement-non-opinion
it's hard to find good child care,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
going to be fine all day long.#Other
And you brought up a good point, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Uninterpretable
about learning,#Other
you just don't want a baby-sitter#Statement-opinion
you, you would hope that maybe they'd come home and know some of their A B C's or something, you know,#Statement-opinion
get them,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, and he's, he's doing real well,#Statement-non-opinion
it, it, it has paid off for him.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He's in first grade now,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he's, you know, got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you know, those early ages when he would, you know, when his mom and dad are at work,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he's actually in child care in a preschool not,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just child care,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, we could have sent him to anybody,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
there's a lot people at work that would have baby-sat him but sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
has paid off not only for us,#Other
his, his attitude is I think a little bit,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
tall for a six year old#Other
and, you know, but his,#Uninterpretable
Did you take this same, uh, route with your other two children?#Yes-No-Question
Um, they, they were outside my marriage,#Hold before answer/agreement
Okay#Response Acknowledgement
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, I don't know.#Hedge
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was wondering how,#Uninterpretable
I would say, no,#No answers
but, you know, all my children,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
excel,#Other
they're, they're really good,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I guess, no,#Statement-non-opinion
he learns from the older boys too#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it helps that he has older brothers, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, just to have role models and things like that.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
seeing#Uninterpretable
like, uh, in one way we're kind of lucky because they're all boys,#Statement-non-opinion
but in another way we're not so lucky because we don't have another woman in the house for my wife to share,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, we faced that too#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he learns quite a bit,#Other
he learned quite a bit from, not only from nursery school#Statement-non-opinion
but he learned quite a bit from the older boys,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, he's excelled#Statement-non-opinion
and it's paying off for him,#Statement-opinion
it really is.#Statement-opinion
He's,#Statement-non-opinion
That's excellent.#Appreciation
he is pretty smart,#Other
sometimes he's a little bit smart mouthed,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
but he is smart you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, what kid isn't#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
these days,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
But I think it's important, I think it's really nice to know that you can find someplace,#Statement-opinion
I don't know, you know, how it is down there in Waco,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but in Lubbock we have a few that you can send your children to#Statement-non-opinion
and they can actually learn something instead of just being baby-sat.#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Uninterpretable
Do they have any kind of program like at T I or wherever your wife works, um,#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
not in,#Statement-non-opinion
some in kind of day care?#Other
Huh-uh.#No answers
We just,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh, because I know they're, they're putting that into a lot of, uh, corporations now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're trying to.#Statement-non-opinion
The federal government is trying to intercede on that too,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, no,#No answers
we don't get,#Statement-non-opinion
So, maybe that will be an option for,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, it would be nice, you know, there,#Statement-non-opinion
But then I, I foresee that being just a baby-sitting thing not much learning but, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's not,#Uninterpretable
well,#Uninterpretable
kind of somebody to just watch your kid while your at work.#Other
You know, where, where we sent Michael the first few years was, there was different teachers all the time, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
some,#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
girls were there in the morning#Other
and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and then they had a group of kids#Statement-non-opinion
and they put on skits#Statement-non-opinion
and they put on plays,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they did the Halloween thing,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the Valentine's Day things#Other
and it's, you know, it was important to us,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so we, you know, we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you think it would have been better for him to have, um, maybe one continuous teacher, somebody to, that he could, uh,#Yes-No-Question
Um,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
get attached to#Other
or is it better the other way with a lot of different,#Or-Clause
No,#No answers
because I think, you know, as a child growing up I think is a task that belongs to his parents.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't think he needed to be attached to too, even though he did,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, he attached himself to a couple of those,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I think his attachments at home#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, he gets the idea of what school is for#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, you know, I have different teachers,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
here#Other
and this person can teach me one thing and this person teach, teach me another#Quotation
and, no,#No answers
so, I, I, I really can't say that it would be, it's important for him to attach himself to anybody.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He did well,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you#Uninterpretable
with, with another child I can't say that.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I don't have that experience.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
each child is individual,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
see.#Uninterpretable
in life learning and things.#Other
But I don't have that experience,#Statement-non-opinion
so, I can't say that,#Reject
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, he did well,#Other
so, I don't think we made too many mistakes.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, it sounds good,#Appreciation
We tried hard.#Statement-non-opinion
sounds like he's doing real well.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he's doing real well.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
good.#Appreciation
And he learned from it#Statement-non-opinion
so, and that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be baby-sat all day.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, baby-sat sounds to me like, well, you're here, I guess I'll watch you when I get time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, maybe I'll clean my house, maybe I'll cook you lunch,#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
maybe I won't, you know,#Other
and,#Other
And they'll probably sit him in front of the television,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Other
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, while they do other things,#Other
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I don't, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't allow that when he's at home#Other
so, but we had a good experience,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Other
and we really did well.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's good,#Appreciation
that's good.#Appreciation
So, and he did, he served better than we did, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
he gained, he actually gained from it, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
sure we gained from it,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because we were allowed to continue our employment and,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
continue our family#Other
but I think in the long run he gained from it just being somewhere where we learned something,#Statement-opinion
That's great.#Appreciation
instead of just sitting around watching T V,#Other
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and playing all day.#Other
And it's important.#Statement-opinion
That's probably what I'll try and look for whenever I do have my children,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know when that will be,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, um, you know, just really look into,#Statement-non-opinion
it will, it will take me a long time to find somewhere I'm sure,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well,#Uninterpretable
just because I, I just want to be, I want to be so positive that, you know, my children are okay,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as well as the other children in the center, you know.#Other
Well, you know, his Mom didn't go back to work until, you know, when he was six months old.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we just didn't want to dump him somewhere,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and make him feel like he wasn't wanted.#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
And we wanted his center of attention at home#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we did what we could#Other
and it, it worked out real well,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm glad,#Statement-non-opinion
It's difficult these day,#Statement-non-opinion
we were so careful.#Other
It's, it's a lot more difficult these days because you have both parents working a lot of times,#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Yes-No-Question
and, so, you have to find day care,#Statement-opinion
Well, it,#Other
whereas, you know, here,#Other
Most of the time now it's a necessity,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you can't afford,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, you know, I'm not making seventy or thir-, eighty thousand dollars a year#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's pretty tough.#Other
No choice,#Collaborative Completion
so child care's a necessity, whereas years ago, you know, the husband basically worked and the wife,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and,#Other
basically stayed home.#Other
Mom, Mom was allowed to stay home#Other
and,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, there was a few families outside of that where dad stayed home and mom worked but not very many that I know of when I was growing up,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, I'm forty now#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, when I was a kid Mom was always at home.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, we didn't,#Uninterpretable
I think that has a lot to do with just, just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is, is breaking, you know,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is,#Agree/Accept
yeah#Agree/Accept
it is,#Agree/Accept
the basic family is not there anymore.#Statement-opinion
I'll agree with that, it is.#Agree/Accept
It's, it's not there.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that plays a big part in, in a child's learning and, you know, what they can and cannot do in child care.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't think,#Uninterpretable

Okay,#Other
we're on, uh, recycling#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
and, uh, I am not real well informed on exactly what Richardson does.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know that we, uh, they ask us to bundle our newspapers,#Statement-non-opinion
and we do that,#Statement-non-opinion
and we recycle our aluminum pop cans and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But now Plano has quite an elaborate system, don't they?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
they do.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, it started out several years ago when they put these, uh, collection sites#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they, uh, near a WalMart, near a football stadium and the like,#Other
and they just couldn't believe how many people were going out of their way to fill these things up.#Statement-non-opinion
These huge dumpsters were being filled up in a, in a matter of a week.#Statement-non-opinion
So they knew that there was something going on here.#Statement-non-opinion
So, they started looking into programs,#Statement-non-opinion
and what we have now,#Statement-non-opinion
it, they changed the whole way that they do garbage in Plano.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Instead of collecting plastic bags of garbage two days a week, they make a collection on Monday for yard waste,#Statement-non-opinion
and the yard waste has to be put in a special bag that's a decomposable paper sack#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's a pretty good size.#Statement-non-opinion
It's maybe the size of two or three, um, grocery bags.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we put that out by the street,#Statement-non-opinion
and they collect those on Monday.#Statement-non-opinion
And then on Wednesday, we put out two containers that they gave us.#Statement-non-opinion
One container's a huge, green, monstrous thing that a, uh, uh, a special truck comes by and hooks onto the side of it and flips the container into the back of the garbage truck.#Statement-non-opinion
So and that's where you put your regular, um, garbage and trash.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then also, that same day, you put out a small tub,#Statement-non-opinion
it's maybe two feet high and three feet by two feet wide,#Statement-non-opinion
and you put, just throw in your aluminum and your milk jugs and newspaper,#Statement-non-opinion
and then the.#Uninterpretable
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then they recy-, they separate it.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Exactly,#Affirmative non-yes answers
they have a big truck that has like te-, not ten, maybe five big doors on the side of it,#Statement-non-opinion
and they throw the different stuff in the different doors.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's a neat system.#Appreciation
Yeah#Agree/Accept
it is.#Agree/Accept
And apparently it's, you know, it, it went off pretty much without a hitch.#Statement-non-opinion
The trucks, the special five door trucks were a little tough in getting because of something to do with the Persian Gulf war#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that the trucks were being, the engines or something were being shipped over there for something or other.#Statement-non-opinion
But it does work pretty well.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I know our son and daughter-in-law live in Plano,#Statement-non-opinion
and I know they have commented on the system.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know that they know that it worked that way,#Statement-non-opinion
but they have the two separate containers and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I noticed something interesting last time, I guess two Wednesdays ago when they were picking up,#Statement-non-opinion
I happened to be out there in the morning when they were picking up the, that tub stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
and the man who was doing the separating, when he was done emptying the tub, he took a little electronic reader device off of his belt#Statement-non-opinion
and he read the bar code that was on the side of the tub.#Statement-non-opinion
So they must be collecting information about who does it, and how often.#Statement-opinion
Oh, that is interesting.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I wonder if that means that if you don't do it#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
do you suppose they will come and knock on your door and,#Yes-No-Question
I, I don't know,#Other answers
but I think that's a really interesting question.#Statement-opinion
That, that is interesting.#Appreciation
You know, will you be penalized if you don't.#Rhetorical-Questions
Will you, uh.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, that seems farfetched only because it, it, there's no law that says you have to buy a newspaper#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
or pop cans or milk jugs.#Other
So there, there's, it's possible that there is a person in Plano that doesn't buy any of those three things, and therefore wouldn't have.#Statement-opinion
That's true, except that it's hard to imagine, you know, when you have, uh, cans, you know, from the, the market and, uh#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, vegetable cans, and et cetera.#Other
No,#Reject
they won't take vegetable cans.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, they don't take vegetable cans.#Repeat-phrase
Just, just the aluminum pop cans.#Statement-non-opinion
This is just their aluminum cans.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, then yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
so they have,#Uninterpretable
that's interesting.#Appreciation
I wonder, uh, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what they're doing with that.#Collaborative Completion
Wouldn't you really like to know?#Yes-No-Question
I would.#Affirmative non-yes answers
.#Non-verbal
Someday I'm sure we'll find out.#Statement-opinion
I'm sure#Agree/Accept
you know, if nothing else call the sanitation department say, okay,#Action-directive
what are you doing reading you know.#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
So tell me your feelings on recycling.#Action-directive
Is it, do you think this is a good thing, or silly.#Or-Clause
I think it's a very good thing.#Statement-opinion
I think that, uh, I think it helps if the city is giving you a nudge to do it#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I think there are a lot of people that don't do it,#Other
and I can't say that my husband and I are real, real conscientious.#Statement-non-opinion
We got started on the aluminum cans because our, uh, grandson was collecting them, uh, to raise money#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and stuff for an organization he was in.#Other
So we started collecting them,#Statement-non-opinion
and now he's through,#Statement-non-opinion
so we've just, we've kept on#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's interesting, too, that we have to drive, we drive to Plano at Plano Road to, uh, just inside your city limits, to, you know#Statement-opinion
Dump them off.#Collaborative Completion
turn them in#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and that is interesting.#Agree/Accept
to dump them in.#Other
I'm sure there's bound to be some here in Richardson#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but we just haven't really seen them advertised or#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, something.#Other
Well, the Pl-,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
the Plano newspaper each, each day, in fact, has a, a little list of all the recycling centers for all the different things.#Statement-non-opinion
They publish it every single day.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's interesting.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and phone numbers, and, and that kind of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I haven't noticed, uh, I haven't noticed Richardson, you know, making that big a,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay#Other
well,#Uninterpretable
There we are.#Statement-non-opinion
All right. Um, um, well, uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
tell me about the car that you've got.#Action-directive
Well, I have a Honda, um, hatchback, nineteen eighty-four.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I had a hatchback, a nineteen seventy-eight version before this one.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I'll be honest with you.#Statement-non-opinion
I have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and, and, uh, put together#Statement-non-opinion
and it, it does its job.#Statement-opinion
All I have to do on my Honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty-five hundred miles,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I did have to put two, two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles,#Statement-non-opinion
but that car just purrs like the day it was built.#Statement-non-opinion
I get forty-two miles per gallon on the highway and uh, twen-, twenty-eight to thirty driving around in town.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a five speed straight stick machine.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, I can carry more in that, uh, that trunk area in my little Honda than I can in the big cars,#Statement-non-opinion
and I have a large, um, Pontiac,#Statement-non-opinion
and I have a sixty-nine Cougar, which really is, I'm saving because it's, it's old,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's in beautiful shape.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I can carry as much in my Honda or more than I can in, in those other bigger cars.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's very interesting.#Appreciation
I've had, I've had exactly the same experience with the one that I've got.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a,#Uninterpretable
and surprisingly it's also an eighty-four#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
L X?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I'm still here.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I'm sorry what?#Signal-non-understanding
It was an L X?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
it's an L X,#Statement-non-opinion
it's not a hatchback,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's, um, it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yours is a four door.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Four door,#Affirmative non-yes answers
yeah#Yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and very, very comfortable car.#Statement-opinion
Big roomy trunk#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, and, uh, and very happy with it,#Statement-non-opinion
and I must admit it's, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
if, if, if, uh,#Uninterpretable
my only consideration were, were, you know, buying another car just to tool around town in and make, you know, brief trips and things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
I would very, very seriously consider buying one. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I think they're extraordinarily reliable cars.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
they are.#Statement-opinion
Um, my, my real concern with, uh, uh, why I'm not sure I want to buy a Honda, is because I have to make a kind of a, a steady, um, trip down the road about once a month, because I'm divorced#Statement-non-opinion
and I have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina#Statement-non-opinion
Um, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I drive,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
down Interstate Ninety-five,#Other
and it's just an absolutely wild highway.#Statement-opinion
Ninety-five is wild in any car.#Statement-opinion
There's no doubt about that#Agree/Accept
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and,#Uninterpretable
because I, I, I run over to Crystal City, or used to,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm retiring the end of this month#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there.#Statement-non-opinion
And, you, well, you've got it,#Agree/Accept
and, uh, so having precious cargo in the car with me as you can well imagine, it's very hard for me to imagine that, that, uh, a Honda's going to be as safe a car as, as the one that I've got my eye on, which is a Volvo.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In, in fact, quite frankly I've owned a Volvo in the past,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I've, I've,#Other
they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I've found that I've had a lot of luck with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, course I'm a mechanically inclined kind of person,#Statement-non-opinion
and I always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that, you know, need to be taken care of, and so forth.#Statement-non-opinion
And I guess that's one thing that, that recommends the Honda to a lot of people, is is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood,#Statement-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it just, just sits there and purrs,#Statement-non-opinion
and you, all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter.#Statement-non-opinion
I get six hundred miles on a tank of gas.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I know.#Agree/Accept
It's really amazing.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, uh,#Statement-opinion
Beautiful, beautiful machine.#Collaborative Completion
Absolutely,#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
incredible#Appreciation
So, um, yeah,#Uninterpretable
anyway, I've been looking at the prices of these cars and, and so forth,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think that it's, it's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're#Statement-opinion
Is that right,#Backchannel in question form
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
willing to buy ones that are about,#Other
.#Non-verbal
the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um,#Uninterpretable
Well, a brand new Volvo costs, what, thirty thousand dollars?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, certainly some of the top end ones.#Affirmative non-yes answers
You can still get, get, uh, even the, the low end wagons, um, for less than twenty thousand dollars#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, we get, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
in the Washington area, of course, being as affluent as it is, there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here#Statement-non-opinion
Um, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any, any week,#Statement-non-opinion
and I sort of, you know, scan the paper and look at them, and so forth#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, um, anyway, and that's, that's the other thing is that I've, I've never really been too terribly much of a new car person.#Other
I think I've bought one or two new cars in my life,#Statement-non-opinion
and I've tended to, um, to, uh, buy cars that are, you know, two or three, and sometimes even four and five or six years old.#Statement-non-opinion
This Honda that I have I bought used,#Statement-non-opinion
and, in fact, it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it.#Statement-non-opinion
I've just rolled seventy thousand miles,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's a seventy-four, I mean, an eighty-four.#Statement-non-opinion
So#Uninterpretable
Well, my, my eighty-four just has seventy-seven on it#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I've made many trips to Washington and down to Virginia Beach, Virginia, where my mother lives, and things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
and I drive it,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay,#Other
what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful#Wh-Question
Have a big family, I guess,#Statement-opinion
that's a start.#Statement-opinion
Well I guess so.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
Have you had any in the la-, ha-,#Yes-No-Question
well how old are you?#Wh-Question
Twenty-five,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Okay#Response Acknowledgement
so you ha-,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
I just got married.#Statement-non-opinion
you have been to some family reunions, perhaps.#Other
Right,#Affirmative non-yes answers
every four years on one side of my family they plan on having, uh, like my p-, grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids.#Statement-non-opinion
Now how long in advance do they, uh, let them know?#Wh-Question
Well, we plan on it,#Dispreferred answers
it's like the third weekend in August,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Response Acknowledgement
so it's every four years#Statement-non-opinion
and so,#Uninterpretable
So they all know it.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah#Agree/Accept
and then, you know, arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know, um, food and who's, who's staying where, because a lot of people fro-, are from down here, in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, a lot of my family is in Indiana.#Statement-non-opinion
That's where I'm originally from.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, um, we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the, um, at the lake and, uh, make a couple days of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well that sounds like fun,#Appreciation
do they all have the small children too, that come?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
pretty much.#Statement-non-opinion
So all ages.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah#Yes answers
and, uh, you know, there's some my age#Statement-non-opinion
and then there are some a lot younger, an, about four generations, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
Well my husband has, uh, on one side has an extended family,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they don't ever plan it li-, as, like you do.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind#Statement-opinion
so they have to start talking about it, or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because they're rather socially active too.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so it has, it seems by doing it about six months ahead, they can pretty much get everybody there.#Statement-non-opinion
If they don't, you know, they'll say, oh we're planning to go so and so that, go to, to a certain place that weekend with somebody else#Statement-non-opinion
and we're already locked in#Quotation
but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My family, uh, my parents are the youngest of very large families.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Therefore, they don't have many people left.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the few previous ones I've had, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't known many of those people,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family#Statement-non-opinion
and that's been very nice,#Statement-non-opinion
with, uh,#Uninterpretable
I have one sister,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and three brothers#Other
and they're only three out of five of us who have children.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they don't see each other very often,#Statement-non-opinion
we don't really know many of them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's kind of bad.#Appreciation
It really is,#Agree/Accept
they're fun,#Statement-non-opinion
they're a lot of fun,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, still, uh, they're not done on a regular basis#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, you kind of forget what happened, and who they were from the time before.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's, it's fun getting together with immediate family.#Statement-opinion
A lot of my cousins are real close#Statement-non-opinion
and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Uh, those are the ones that are in Texas?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, no,#No answers
Or you go to Indiana on that?#Or-Clause
the ones in Indiana,#Affirmative non-yes answers

it's a little north of Indianapolis, about an hour.#Statement-non-opinion

yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's very pretty country in there I think,#Statement-opinion
it's gorgeous.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
so.#Uninterpretable
Well I,#Uninterpretable
uh, when is your next one, uh, scheduled now.#Wh-Question
Well it's like, the last one was my high school graduation#Statement-non-opinion
the next one was when I graduated from college,#Statement-non-opinion
so I guess about two more years.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes, well,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you#Yes-No-Question
Uh, maybe,#Other answers
I don't know,#Other answers
Maybe#Repeat-phrase
two more years,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Other answers
probably.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I mean you need another milestone, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I guess that's, that's what,#Uninterpretable
I mean I've been married now for about nine months#Statement-non-opinion
so that was another milestone, I guess#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
well I'm sure,#Agree/Accept
and ha-, then all of your family probably has not met your husband.#Declarative Yes-No-Question

Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Oh, really.#Backchannel in question form

Are they getting all the data they need?#Yes-No-Question
Well, I don't know, uh,#Other answers
I, I have a hard time getting, uh, people on the telephone.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really.#Backchannel in question form
Uh-huh, getting through to anybody.#Statement-non-opinion
Sometimes I call off and on all day,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but anyway, uh, I guess we're supposed to be talking about family reunions aren't we#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
But I got off that.#Statement-non-opinion
Well we've kind of exhausted everything I guess.#Conventional-closing
Yes,#Conventional-closing
well, um, I think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes.#Conventional-closing
Oh, okay.#Conventional-closing
And, uh, uh, we both look forward to going to our next reunions, I'm sure.#Conventional-closing
Oh yeah.#Conventional-closing
But it has been fun talking to you.#Conventional-closing

Okay.#Other
Uh, before a couple of years ago, I had a, a very narrow view of, of nursing homes#Statement-non-opinion
and it was, uh, more like a funeral home.#Statement-non-opinion
I always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, then I had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler, Texas#Statement-non-opinion
and I went to one#Statement-non-opinion
and it just had a very good activities director.#Statement-non-opinion
Everyone was cheerful#Statement-non-opinion
and now I don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore.#Statement-non-opinion
But I, I certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last re-, resort.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I have a sister that is in nursing school#Statement-non-opinion
and she's real interested in geriatrics.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that sounds good.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, she, she's real interested in, uh, what Ann Richards has been doing.#Statement-non-opinion
She's, Ann Richards is really cracking down on, uh, the nursing homes#Statement-non-opinion
and, I don't know, you wouldn't know anything about a Texas governor#Statement-opinion
I've heard the name#Statement-non-opinion
and that's about all it goes.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Ann Richards is our governor in Texas#Statement-non-opinion
and she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, my sister's real interested in that and, and getting into the, to that side of nursing.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's one problem with the, the nursing home environment.#Statement-opinion
It, the elderly, even out of the nursing home, are very open to abuse.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you know, they don't always have their full wits about them.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it can be pretty sad.#Statement-opinion
I've got a, had a grandmother who had a stroke.#Statement-non-opinion
And she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, it's the type of thing that she was living down in Florida.#Statement-non-opinion
My in-, families was up in Maryland#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the other part of her family was up in, uh, New York state.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was, uh, you know, could not do very much for herself after the stroke.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, the nursing home was the, you know, best facility to put her in.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work#Other
and both my, uh, aunts and uncle work.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which means it's, you know, very difficult for some-,#Other
you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in the home.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which makes it, you know,#Other
it's a necessary evil I think.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
It sure is.#Agree/Accept
And some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive. Because#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, even there you have to watch out for, you know,#Statement-opinion
you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there#Statement-opinion
and, you know, the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My grandfather passed away several years ago.#Statement-non-opinion
I was much younger.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life#Statement-non-opinion
and someone visited him every day.#Statement-non-opinion
My grandmother did.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, if she couldn't, someone visited him every day.#Statement-non-opinion
It was in a very small town nursing home.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, people didn't get paid much there at all.#Statement-non-opinion
They didn't care about what went on.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They would let a, let a patient get a lot of bed sores.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the, the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people.#Statement-non-opinion
And then, the nurses and doctors really didn't put any for, forth any loving care for them.#Statement-non-opinion
Either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to put in the, uh, care that they need.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Cause it's, you know,#Other
an elderly person can, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it's like a newborn baby.#Statement-opinion
You need#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to have twenty-four hour care#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, answering all the needs cause they can't do much for themselves at certain points.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And nurses get so worn down.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, there's a lot of, number of#Statement-opinion
the elderly are very, you know, complaining because they remember the way that things used to be.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And remember being able to do things for themselves which, you know, they no longer can.#Other
Oh, sure.#Agree/Accept
And they feel#Statement-opinion
And it, very, very hard for them to accept that.#Statement-opinion
they feel pretty helpless.#Other
We just, uh, moved my grandfather into, not a nursing home but, you know, a transitional type facility.#Statement-non-opinion
Is it, uh, like a retirement center?#Yes-No-Question
More of a retirement home.#Other answers
He's got his own efficiency apartment.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Response Acknowledgement
And they provide one meal a day.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But they do have, you know, group activities going on.#Statement-non-opinion
How's he handling that?#Wh-Question
Uh, he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you know, to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Ooh.#Appreciation
it's, it's a bit of a shock to the system, weather-wise, if nothing else.#Other
Oh, sure.#Appreciation
There wasn't anything like that, that you could do in Florida?#Yes-No-Question
Well there was stuff like that in Florida#Affirmative non-yes answers
but,#Uninterpretable

Why don't you tell me about your choir.#Action-directive
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Okay,#Agree/Accept
well, we, uh, are a group of, uh, musicians that just kind of have, you know, formed out of a desire to sing#Statement-non-opinion
and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they, or just real talented I should say.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
others have,#Uninterpretable
there's one gal that's in the, uh, Plano Community Orchestra. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
just, you know, different backgrounds.#Statement-non-opinion
It's been really kind of interesting.#Statement-non-opinion
Great.#Appreciation
So,#Uninterpretable
Uh, I play the piano#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I have a four year old who, who has started to play the piano.#Statement-non-opinion
He does that, uh, musically, listens#Statement-non-opinion
and then he can play, which is kind of interesting.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the, since he was a baby.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, my husband and my other son, who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here, in, in the community at Music Man.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, they did?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes-No-Question
and that's#Statement-non-opinion
How did,#Wh-Question
lots of fun.#Other
How did they get involved in that?#Other
Uh, basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions.#Statement-non-opinion
It was the Plano Repertory Theatre.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so they went and tried out#Statement-non-opinion
and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man#Statement-non-opinion
and my son played one of the children in a band.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how fun.#Appreciation
So, yeah,#Agree/Accept
it was really fun,#Agree/Accept
and, uh, my son plays the clarinet in his band at school,#Statement-non-opinion
and my daughter takes piano lessons, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, we just really like music.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a, I, I especially like it as an outlet when the T V goes off,#Statement-non-opinion
we#Statement-non-opinion
Um, uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
get the T V off and just have some nice quiet music.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's nice.#Appreciation
You say have your four year old taking lessons already?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
And, uh, who do you have her, or him, take it from?#Wh-Question
Uh, I have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which is an auditory type learning experience.#Other
You listen to the music and then learn to play it by lear-, by hearing the intervals and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I teach, uh, like what is traditionally taught, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
you look at the note on the page#Statement-non-opinion
and you play what's on the piano,#Statement-non-opinion
but he can't learn like that.#Statement-non-opinion
He's a delayed child.#Statement-non-opinion
He's only about, I guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it, uh, with his right hand,#Statement-non-opinion
we went, wow#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we better have him do s-, do something.#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, educationally.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that was really fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, because my,#Uninterpretable
My husband and I love to go to the musicals downtown, though.#Statement-non-opinion
Pardon me?#Signal-non-understanding
So, my husband and I love to go to the musicals when they come into town#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
into Dallas.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because she wanted, you know, she just seemed to enjoy it so much#Statement-non-opinion
and now my, my four year old, four and a half year old daughter is, is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play#Statement-non-opinion
and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally.#Statement-non-opinion
She just,#Uninterpretable
Oh, I think that's great.#Statement-opinion
So I wasn't sure when to start her.#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't want to push her too early, either, but, uh, kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene.#Statement-non-opinion
That's really hard I think, because, especially if you start them#Statement-opinion
and then they get pretty good#Statement-opinion
and then they get close, ten, you know, eleven or something,#Statement-opinion
they go, I don't want to do this anymore#Statement-opinion
and you're like#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
God, I really want you to do it.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So sometimes it's hard to, to know exactly when,#Statement-opinion
but, I don't know,#Hedge
if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it.#Action-directive
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think she'd like to,#Statement-non-opinion
I just don't know if it's really,#Uninterpretable
knowing from what my daughter has gone through, she's, she learned a lot#Statement-non-opinion
and, of course, it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was something easily forgotten.#Statement-non-opinion
So, uh, I don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight#Statement-non-opinion
or, or should I say seven.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally.#Statement-non-opinion
She does have to really work at it,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, so,#Uninterpretable
That's like me.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, so I'm kind of, you know, just playing with it,#Statement-non-opinion
but at this point we're going to kind of wait, I think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Well, it can get expensive#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's for sure.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, my friend is, is very generous in, in letting us have my children, uh, do the Suzuki method#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
without paying a lot out.#Other
Oh, that's good.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
so it's been good for our family.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a Suzuki method,#Yes-No-Question
have you had any former Suzuki students?#Yes-No-Question
I don't have any Suzuki students. Uh,#Negative non-no answers

Probably not.#Negative non-no answers
Uh, we already knew we wanted to take one,#Statement-non-opinion
and we just started looking around.#Statement-non-opinion
I may have referred to a couple of them,#Statement-non-opinion
but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
resort information, picked up a lot of brochures#Other

and, let's see, we do have NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC,#Statement-non-opinion
and then we have some church magazines,#Statement-non-opinion
but I really enjoy the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a great, great help.#Other
Does it have, uh, articles on how to do things#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth?#Other
Uh-huh,#Yes answers
they do have, uh, mostly they have, uh, the ads on the equipment,#Statement-non-opinion
but the whole magazine is just filled with, uh, pictures and projects that you can make yourself,#Statement-non-opinion
and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project, and, and then how to paint it with the tole paintings,#Statement-non-opinion
and so, it's really a fun one.#Statement-non-opinion
I like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
It's good to get use out of one.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Agree/Accept
I'm not sure that, um, in the case of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC,#Uninterpretable
I mean, I read it,#Statement-non-opinion
but then they just sort of gather dust for a#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
long period of time,#Other
but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find#Statement-non-opinion

you know, France or something or whatever it is#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he's looking for.#Other

I've, I've noticed that, too,#Agree/Accept
but they have been nice to have around.#Statement-opinion
Every once in a while they come in handy#Statement-opinion
I used to take SMITHSONIAN#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
too,#Other
I liked that magazine#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it was, I was, just found myself not ever getting around to reading it.#Statement-non-opinion

You get so many coming in,#Statement-opinion
and by the time the next round comes in I'm still not through reading the first round.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house, too, I forgot,#Statement-non-opinion

if you don't keep them weeded out, they almost take over.#Other
They do, they can do that.#Agree/Accept
I found that they've been fun for my little girls,#Statement-non-opinion

they're just kind of getting started now.#Declarative Yes-No-Question

it's fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I do have a boy in junior high, too,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Oh, okay,#Response Acknowledgement
so you got a little bit of a gap there between,#Summarize/reformulate
so we're kind of running the gamut#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Uninterpretable

I have, uh,#Uninterpretable
I, well, I used to have the opinion that there wa-, that there really was not any more crime in America, in the cities, anyway, than there was in previous centuries, uh, before, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
simply because.#Uninterpretable
The reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced, uh, reporting methods, with computers and other devices.#Statement-opinion
Compile more statistics.#Summarize/reformulate
That's right,#Agree/Accept
and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
However, I have been persuaded, lately, I guess, simply by the, uh, overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime.#Statement-opinion
More especially where you are.#Agree/Accept
Are you,#Or-Clause
Well, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in Washington D C or Washington state?#Other
No,#No answers
I am in, I am in Washington D C.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was going to say,#Uninterpretable
Actually it,#Uninterpretable
you know, I do a lot of business here,#Statement-non-opinion
and I come here quite often#Statement-non-opinion
and, and that again is a, is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Regardless of the racial makeup,#Other
but it's, it's real, uh,#Uninterpretable
there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
It just really grabs your attention.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
It just makes the whole place seem like that.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now just to focus on that a minute, I guess, uh, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
when, uh, previous secretary of, uh, educa-, Bennett, I think his name was,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
became the drug czar, uh, for, uh, President Bush, he was going to focus on it, on this area and do something about it#Other
and I see that even he was met without, with, with little success, even though the entire, I guess a, a quite a bit of money and other, uh, planning efforts went into that.#Statement-non-opinion
What do you, what do you think is causing all this,#Open-Question
Well,#Uninterpretable
because, it seems that there#Uninterpretable
even though#Uninterpretable
crime, though I think it is increasing in number, it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity,#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
and violence too.#Other
Well, I, I have three theories about it, you know, three things.#Statement-non-opinion
I have one theory,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's brought to us by two things.#Statement-non-opinion
One I, I believe that this is a function of, uh, the violence that young people see on television and the movies.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, I am not just talking about, you know, uh, role models of gu-, of tough guys and gangsters and things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
I am not even, I am not even convinced that maybe things like football, hockey and, th-, th-, the, you know, the, and even baseball games now where the, everything is settled with a fight. You know, the, the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle th-,#Statement-opinion
*#Non-verbal
the argument.#Other
And, and then I, I am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree,#Statement-non-opinion
so I think that particularly#Uninterpretable
I, I was reading the other day about, uh, Corpus Christi, Texas which has the the highest,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it's Corpus Christi, that had the highest rates per hand gun death in America#Statement-non-opinion
Um. *#Other
uh, per capita.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was, I have not seen that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
I mean the Saturday night special stuff#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That, that's what I think about it,#Statement-non-opinion
that's some of the things I think about it,#Statement-non-opinion
plus I do not know,#Statement-non-opinion
what are your views?#Open-Question
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I tend to agree with you with, you know,#Agree/Accept
it seems anymore, uh, a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some, some sort of violence,#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
or something in it.#Other
And, and along with that, you know,#Uninterpretable
and then you start making a movie and it has no, there's no call for something violent,#Statement-opinion
but, so they just throw something in there just to say they have it#Statement-opinion
Exac-,#Agree/Accept
well that's, that's, that's the impression I get, you know.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I, and I imagine that it's, you know, it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society,#Statement-opinion
people want to,#Uninterpretable
it conditions people to it#Statement-opinion
and, uh, you have to amp-,#Uninterpretable
it has to be even, uh, magnified to to attract people's attention. I guess,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
you become callous.#Summarize/reformulate
to have them spend money on something like that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I am sure that it does form role models for young, for young men and young women#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I mean I, I, read now where we are, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
women are arr-, young women are arrested fighting with knives over, over whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whatever reason, which is kind of unheard of when I was young.#Other
Now, I do not want to sound like an old fart,#Dispreferred answers
but,#Uninterpretable
.#Other
that's what#Other
seems that those things happened befor-, did not happen in that manner before television.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Other
And I, I, I, I have to think that, that it has some influence on it.#Statement-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
I listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, Rush Lynn Bottom *#Other
I do not know if you listen to him or not,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
he's on A M,#Statement-non-opinion
but, ther-, there's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the,#Statement-non-opinion
there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for Los Angeles, the guy under Gates,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes.#Yes answers
and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was, just some of the things that he believed in, some of his morals.#Statement-non-opinion
For instance, uh, they asked him if he spanked his kids,#Statement-non-opinion
and he said "You bet, I believe in discipline".#Statement-non-opinion
And people, I, I, I, I guess they confus-, confused discipline with punishment.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, just,#Uninterpretable
it seems anymore that, uh, if, if you have, you know, this type of a moral stance, that people come down on you.#Statement-opinion
It's like, you know, hey, everybody has to be free to do their own thing.#Statement-opinion
And I disagree,#Reject
and I think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes.#Agree/Accept
Well, I mean, I, I guess what I wanted to say and I stopped, uh, I do not know, I got diverted, was that, that, uh, there's so mu-, there's so much of a return from pris-, to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure.#Statement-opinion
And, and that is not emphasized.#Statement-opinion
I recognize there's, there's over crowding problems#Statement-non-opinion
and, and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now, that that's complicated the entire process.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What I also think that,#Uninterpretable
I guess it's the reflection of the society where, where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to, uh,#Statement-opinion
you know, it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you, where you live#Statement-opinion
or. I do not mean respons-, attachment and responsibility,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess I mean any sort of,#Uninterpretable
Well, nobody feels responsibility to do something.#Statement-opinion
It's like, oh boy, I wish they would stop doing that.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I do not know how that's,#Hedge
I do not think it's done by, uh,#Hedge
the changes come simply by statutory nature.#Statement-opinion
I do not know what it really will take#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, I do not know if I have solutions, except, except to,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, I am sort of a, a, an advocate of, of, uh, of letting people, of having free speech#Statement-non-opinion
and I guess to curb, uh,#Uninterpretable
television, uh, the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
However, there does seem to be a,#Uninterpretable
right now in verbalizing,#Uninterpretable
it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then how many,#Uninterpretable
And the sacrifice is not that great.#Statement-opinion
How many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between,#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, what you see and how yo-,#Other
I mean, what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes,#Agree/Accept
I think, I think that's correct.#Agree/Accept
And, yes#Uninterpretable
but, you know, as soon as you start, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, Texas has, uh, Texas has, uh, has always struck me,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean I, I, I have lived in and out of Texas, both in the service and, uh, uh, short business stints.#Statement-non-opinion
And it seems to me they are a pretty, pretty tough law and order state,#Statement-opinion
but that's a,#Uninterpretable
but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state.#Statement-opinion
Just citing that, you know.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, unfortunately you have got a lot of the, uh,#Uninterpretable
some, well a lot of it can be contributed to th-, the racial differences, I mean, just that we are so close,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to the border with Mexico,#Other
we have got a lot of that influence.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Well what do you feel about the, um, present situation in the Mideast?#Open-Question
Well, it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What do you think, Mark?#Open-Question
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree.#Agree/Accept
I think, I think there's definitely been some changes, um,#Statement-opinion
and I think you know, the, the, um, end of the Soviet Union will definitely have its effect on, on the situation.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, you know, in that there's, there's not, you kno-, there, you know, i-, you know,#Uninterpretable
basically since the end of World War two there was always, you know, that little proxy war going on.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, with, um, the U S funding Israel and, and the, um, Soviet Union funding the Arab countries.#Other
And then we'll see what happens when, uh, they're not funded quite as much.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or supplied with arms the same way.#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but on the same token, you know, Israel has lost a lot of their, you know, value to the U S in being, you know, the foothold of capitalism.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know in, in the Mideast.#Other
Well, I, we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, we s-, kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
overall tend to support them.#Other
But, I think one of the most interesting things to me recently was, you know, during the war,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, in, uh, Kuwait was, uh, the fact that they did not retaliate,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for the, uh, scud missiles that were, uh, launched there.#Other
That just seemed to me to be a, uh, a phenomenal, uh, demonstration of restraint,#Statement-opinion
and it must have reflected, uh, uh, some awful good, uh, diplomacy on the part of the U S.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but on the other hand, you know, if they would have had a hard time retaliating because the, you know, they, they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes.#Statement-opinion
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They basically would have, you know, had a, had a f-, they had, they would have had, had to fly through, you know, two enemies.#Statement-opinion
Oh, you don't think they got the codes from the U S already?#Yes-No-Question
The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them.#Statement-opinion
I see.#Response Acknowledgement
I mean, of course, you know, public statements can be taken for,#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
They can, yet they,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
D-,#Uninterpretable
Well what do y-,#Uninterpretable
what about this situation with the, you know, the, uh, continual, uh, harassment by Iraq right now and, uh, apparently failing to let the, uh, arms inspectors have free access.#Open-Question
Uh-huh.#Hold before answer/agreement
You know, well, to begin with, you know,#Hold before answer/agreement
I pretty much question or what, what the U S -s motives were in, uh, in, in actually the original involvement.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I,#Uninterpretable
the cynical side of me says that, you know, it was more for, uh, the, the domestic political situation than for anything else.#Statement-opinion
Huh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and that, you know, and for portraying Bush is a strong President.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I mean I really, I really think that, that, my gut feeling is that, that, you know, he pretty much picked, picked the fight with, uh, with, um, Hussein.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean I'm not, not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to ge-, enter that fight.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, you know, I think, I think that, that, um, we chose to have our official feelings hurt.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Where a lot w-,#Uninterpretable
Well, do you think that, uh, we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and, uh,#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
you know, move on into Kuwait and see what happens?#Other
I think, I mean I thought, I think that, um, in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I, I really don't, I really don't think that,#Statement-opinion
I think, I think it was, it was, there were, there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well may have been.#Statement-opinion
You know, I'm not saying that that's not the case. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I mean in, in, in along this line since, since, you know it, it really, it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting, getting, uh, the Iraqis out of Kuwait.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just don't, I just don't, I, I, I d-, I, I, I don't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and, you know, in, in fighting a second battle.#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
Um, you know, over, over the, uh, over, over what, what probably won't accomplish him, accomplish much for him politically.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
it doesn't look like we're getting ready to do, to do much more in there.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Even at this point.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well what about, uh,#Uninterpretable
do you have any, any views on, uh, Israel's relation to the U S?#Yes-No-Question
Do you,#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
think we ought to, you know,#Other
.#Non-verbal
back off on our support of the country#Other
or what do yo-,#Uninterpretable
Well, I have, I have very fixed feelings about Israel.#Dispreferred answers
Um, I think that, that for a long while we've, we've had almost a, you know, ha-, t-,#Statement-opinion

Okay.#Other
You think you're getting your money's worth?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, never#Negative non-no answers
.#Non-verbal
Uh, the only thing I'm, I'm thankful of is that we don't have to pay any income tax in, in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's probably the next year's agenda.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Boy, I tell you what,#Hold before answer/agreement
I sure hope they don't pass something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
They're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around,#Statement-opinion
and I, I think one way or the other, we're going to pay for the bureaucracy, I guess.#Statement-opinion
Uh, it's one area that is really, I, I think hurting the economy more than anything.#Statement-opinion
I think the taxes have just, every time you turn around they, they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products,#Statement-opinion
and I, I, I think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now.#Statement-opinion
Well, I, I tell you, um,#Hold before answer/agreement
I remember every time, it seems like, we turned around, they're adding another nickel or#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
a few more cents onto the price of gasoline.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
And actually, that one, the, the, the taxes on gasoline don't, don't bug me as much as, uh, uh, what are we, eight and a quarter percent sales tax?#Wh-Question
Yep,#Yes answers
that's right.#Agree/Accept
And every time you go to buy anything now, uh,#Statement-opinion
even, you know, they, they tax food.#Statement-opinion
That's the one that really kind of bothers me.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I think that, uh, that the problem with the sales tax, of course, is it's an unfair tax across the board, uh, as far as ability to pay, which a-, allegedly, allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of, you know, taxes on everything they buy, and where people that make, you know, two hundred, three hundred thousand dollars a year, certainly a portion of that, they aren't going to be paying taxes on, you know.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, that's the unfair equity, inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue,#Statement-opinion
but I don't think it is anymore, not in Texas anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I got you, because people that, uh, don't make very much money wind up spending it all.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whatever they spent it on, they have to pay tax on.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
And that's the unfairness of the thing,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I think taxes generally are unfair#Statement-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Wha-, what do you think of that new luxury car tax, anything over ten thou-, or thirty thousand dollars?#Open-Question
Well, you know, like other things, if they don't affect you, you don't worry about them too much.#Dispreferred answers
.#Non-verbal
I have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still,#Statement-non-opinion
so it doesn't,#Uninterpretable
I, I think, uh, you know, generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line, which is, uh, you know.#Statement-opinion
Oh, sure.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, I guess if people got thirty, forty thousand bucks to spend on a car, uh, that's their prerogative, you know#Statement-opinion
I, I, I don't have a whole of sympathy on that .#Statement-non-opinion
You, maybe you buy that, you know,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
and I don't mean to be knocking, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
No,#No answers
uh, no,#No answers
I haven't,#Statement-non-opinion
but it, it to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax, uh, on top of it.#Statement-opinion
And there's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
there are,#Agree/Accept
there are.#Agree/Accept
And the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that, I guess, you know, unless they really want it, buy something that, you know,#Statement-opinion
more, well, it, it's just like having taxes on, or exemptions for kids, you know.#Statement-opinion
It's a way of increasing the population, that, that was one of the initial ideas of, you know, giving exemptions on kids, on, on federal taxes.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And where you exempt things, like, uh, uh, one of the best things I heard on taxes to stimulate the economy, someone, brilliant deductor, probably Lloyd Bentsen, said that all, you know, if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
people would probably be, you know, spending more money using their credit cards.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now, I don't know if that's true or not,#Statement-non-opinion
but if you look on all interest things, not just credit cards, but on your cars and, you know, a-, any kind of interest that you're paying, from a personal point of view, that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers.#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Agree/Accept
So that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go, you know, tax things that they don't, you know, to a degree, well, like booze, you know,#Statement-opinion
example, they keep raising the taxes on booze,#Statement-opinion
it gets to the point, you know, it makes drunks sober, you know#Statement-opinion
They quit buying it.#Statement-opinion
Well, what, what about the taxes on cigarettes?#Open-Question

Okay,#Other
for as far as, um, I would think the, probably the, uh, worst substance that's probably, um,#Statement-opinion
or, started to say the, uh,#Uninterpretable
what causes the most air pollution is probably the car#Statement-opinion
Probably so,#Appreciation
and, uh, whether or not, um, they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, uh, train or, or something like that#Statement-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's exactly it,#Appreciation
and that's what we're finding, um, here, where we're at, in Minneapolis area, is that people don't want to carpool#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that there are inconveniences to that,#Other
or maybe you don't like the person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing,#Statement-opinion
so it's, it's kind of a thing where, uh, I think the majority of the people do not carpool.#Statement-opinion
I think so too.#Agree/Accept
I'm in Texas#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and very few people carpool#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, the people that I know don't want to because, uh, they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they just feel they need their car.#Other
or if somebody gets sick.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or if somebody gets sick, and it's not the other person#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then they're, they're stuck,#Other
you're#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
definitely right,#Other
so, *#Other
And people don't want to give it up#Statement-opinion
Yes, *#Other
but now I think we've made great strides#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and to change the car itself#Other
Sure,#Agree/Accept
that happens quite a bit,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, you know, I, I don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but#Uninterpretable
that's very true.#Appreciation
yeah. *#Other
Uh, other than that, uh, I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, my other line is ringing#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but we're going to ignore it#Action-directive
Oh, okay,#Agree/Accept
we'll try to be real quick here.#Action-directive
I'm sorry for these beeps,#Apology
The other thing then is, because I don't know how long they want us to talk,#Declarative Wh-Question
Oh, close to five minutes, I believe.#Statement-non-opinion
Five minutes, oh, okay.#Repeat-phrase
And you're in Minneapolis,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Minneapolis area,#Affirmative non-yes answers
Well, is the pollution really bad up there?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, actually no.#Negative non-no answers
We have, uh, quite a bit, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and of course hay fever season#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you get some pollutants such as those,#Statement-non-opinion
but those are natural#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
um, but there is starting to,#Uninterpretable
in Minneapolis itself, because of so many people on the highway, there is becoming a problem of pollution,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you have to have your car inspected#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to see if it's releasing any, uh, lead into the air#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or other pollutants,#Other
and if that's the case, then you have to get your car fixed,#Statement-non-opinion
Well#Statement-non-opinion
at least where you .#Uninterpretable
that's the way it has gotten here.#Other
We have just had that law, I think, about a year, maybe a year and a half here in Texas#Statement-non-opinion
Sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, I think it's a good idea#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's not a bad idea.#Statement-opinion
because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which you can't blame them for that#Other
Sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, but if they are polluting the air, they need, do need to have them fixed#Statement-opinion
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
and you know, there's a big move, especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the C F C -s#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're having to change the type of products they use#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, they can't use,#Uninterpretable
like, I have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning syst-, systems#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it is, it costs them three times as much to get it fixed#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many C F C -s into the atmosphere#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it doesn't cost as much#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, you know,#Other
Sure#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But,#Uninterpretable
uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air conditioning, I'm sure#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
over there it's a necessity#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
versus something up here we can live without it#Other
but it's uncomfortable#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, this year my husband recharged our freon because it was, needed to be done,#Statement-non-opinion
and one of the cans released entire amount#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
of freon into the, uh, into the air because he opened it,#Other
and, I don't know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if there was something wrong with it, or it, his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that,#Other
and I was thinking how many other people#Statement-non-opinion
It's probably happened to millions of people,#Statement-opinion
oh, sure,#Appreciation
because#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you take it into a service station,#Other
.#Non-verbal
they want to charge you forty dollars just for, uh, freon, which only costs you about three dollars#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say, Hey, that's#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's right there.#Other
I think it's like three or four dollars a, a can#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I thought about that,#Statement-non-opinion
and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because I'm sure he breathed it#Statement-non-opinion
Inhaled so much of it,#Collaborative Completion
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, you think about that, all the people that are using freon and things like that#Statement-non-opinion
and, *#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, of course in the, uh,#Uninterpretable
I think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places, in the hair sprays#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh. *#Other
we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
nearly everything is in the pump squirt,#Other
Pump, yeah, *#Repeat-phrase

Okay Charles, uh, gun control,#Statement-non-opinion
what are you, uh, for, in favor or no comment?#Or-Clause
I'm very much in favor of gun control.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you are?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yes#Yes answers
I am.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Well, this should be very interesting,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
because I'm against it.#Other
I don't, I don't mind people owning guns,#Statement-non-opinion
I just think it should be a little, you know, a little, a little more regulated.#Statement-opinion
Well, you know, uh, now he-, here's something that, uh, first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic, uh, weapons.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons.#Statement-non-opinion
I believe that's correct,#Statement-non-opinion
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, yet, their, uh, the gun control enthusiasts are, are, uh, preaching about the gun control and how they should be, we should have stronger laws and what not.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have.#Statement-non-opinion
That would certainly help,#Statement-opinion
I'm sure.#Statement-opinion
Now this is not just a state law,#Statement-non-opinion
this is a federal law,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
controlled by the Treasury Department.#Other
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, for fully automatic weapons.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, all right, now for instance,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
in California where they passed the uh, uh, semiautomatic#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or, or, uh, now what was it they called them?#Self-talk
The military version, attack weapons,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
right,#Affirmative non-yes answers
uh-huh.#Yes answers
or something?#Other
Uh, h-, how is that going to affect the, uh, sports weapons? I mean, rifles,#Wh-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that are automatic or semiautomatic?#Other
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I really don't have any problem, Jack, with, you know, uh, people using firearms for sporting purposes.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't have any problem,#Statement-non-opinion
the only thing I,#Statement-non-opinion
I am in favor of the seven-day waiting period.#Statement-non-opinion
I would like to see that, see that happen.#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
well, now, uh, I've got to admit I'm inclined to agree with you there#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, even though I am a member of the N R A,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they are again-, they, their reason being that well, if you let one little law get through, pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so forth and so on.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I understand that.#Statement-non-opinion
And you've got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way.#Action-directive
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
I, I, like I say, I don't have any problem with people using firearms, you know, for sporting purposes or hunting purposes,#Statement-non-opinion
I just think it's just may be a little too easy you know, to acquire one.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh,#Uninterpretable
On, on a whim of some sort.#Other
That, that's true.#Agree/Accept
Uh, now did you hear about the, the control that they have up in Virginia?#Yes-No-Question
I'm not sure I have.#Other answers
Uh, it, it's, it's a little hard to believe,#Statement-opinion
but they can, uh, of course,#Statement-non-opinion
like just like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law.#Statement-non-opinion
Anyone ever convicted of a, a felony is, cannot purchase a weapon.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they don't have a waiting period, because they have access to computer records concerning all these felons.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the-,#Uninterpretable
uh, when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in, uh, uh, Virginia, the salesman just calls some number and, uh, punches in your name,#Statement-non-opinion
and if it comes up negative, okay, fine,#Statement-non-opinion
and you get your gwu-, your gun right then and there.#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but they are the only state that does it.#Statement-non-opinion
Hm, that's interesting.#Appreciation
And, uh, according to Virginia, it didn't cost all that much.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and frankly, I, I don't understand why a state doesn't have those records available anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, uh, at least#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Agree/Accept
you would think they would.#Statement-opinion
uh, records of, of, uh, known felons#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which are available to local police departments.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I'm surprised that more states doesn't do that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, uh, uh, certainly those, those records are available,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and all they would have to do is expand it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
To, uh, uh, well, connect them into a modem somehow.#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
I wouldn't think it'd be that difficult to do.#Statement-opinion
Well, Virginia is not a particularly rich state,#Statement-non-opinion
and they managed to fi-, squeak out a few bucks to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yep,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
And, uh, it's, uh, uh, one-hundred percent successful.#Statement-non-opinion
Hm, that's interesting.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I just heard about this last week.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, they were bragging about it,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with,#Uninterpretable
uh, uh, they should have, have pride in this because it's, it's a good system,#Statement-opinion
Absolutely.#Agree/Accept
and it's working well.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree.#Agree/Accept
And they don't need that seven-day waiting period.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because the whole idea of that waiting period was,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
so that, uh, it, uh, the police could check up on you.#Other
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you know what's going to happen there,#Statement-opinion
those files are going to back up on somebody's desk, just some of that typical bureaucratic work.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's another, uh, uh, thorn in my side,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
bureaucratics,#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
I agree.#Agree/Accept
politicians.#Other
Yep,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
I was,#Statement-non-opinion
So anyway#Statement-opinion
just thinking there's,#Other
well, we seem to be one in favor and one against.#Other
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I guess that's about right,#Statement-opinion
Although neither one of us are, are, uh, really uh, uh, dyed in the wool.#Statement-opinion
Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, we,#Uninterpretable
but we both,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm not totally rigid on the subject,#Statement-non-opinion
I just think there should be, you know, shouldn't be quite so easy to do.#Statement-non-opinion
well, there should be some way of checking,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now here in, in Texas, uh, all you need is a driver's license.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, even felons can still get a driver's license.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure, uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I, I don't think they are too,#Statement-opinion
well, they're not rigid enough here, in Texas.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
But don't tell the N R A I said that.#Action-directive
I wo-,#Uninterpretable
I promise.#Agree/Accept
I won't#Agree/Accept
They're liable to tear up my membership.#Statement-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I promise#Statement-non-opinion
You say you retired a year ago?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
I did,#Affirmative non-yes answers

I'm looking forward to it in about a, just, just over a year, myself.#Statement-non-opinion

I really enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh,#Uninterpretable
I stay pretty busy.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do quite a, not quite a lot,#Statement-non-opinion
I do some, uh, volunteer work here in Plano.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I have a few, uh, handicapped persons that I, you know, try to do things for, help them do.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, uh, I bought a motor home here f-, four years ago#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I have been living in it ever since,#Statement-non-opinion
That's, uh,#Uninterpretable
and I'm looking forward to just traveling.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can understand that.#Appreciation
I have four sons scattered all over the country,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a f-, few grandchildren.#Other
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them.#Statement-non-opinion
That'd be neat.#Appreciation

Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

I guess we are just to discuss trials and, and punishment. If it's to be given by the judge or not.#Statement-non-opinion
Did you, did you catch your explanation of that?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
I did.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The, uh,#Uninterpretable
maybe I'm a hard liner#Statement-non-opinion
but I think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases. Rather than, uh, degrees of sentencing.#Statement-opinion
You mean the crimes or the punishment should fit the crime?#Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Okay#Response Acknowledgement
Uh, again, having participated in jury duty myself, I know#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
I did also.#Statement-non-opinion
I know how such a diverse group of people get together, the different backgrounds, different ideas, that#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sometimes you can have one person or two,#Other
.#Non-verbal
that can hold up what I consider the proper sentencing,#Other
.#Non-verbal
of the p-, person.#Other
Could you hang on one minute Jim?#Action-directive
Yes ma'am.#Agree/Accept
Thank you#Thanking
.#Non-verbal
I am so sorry to keep you on hold.#Apology
No problem.#Downplayer
Are you at work?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
I am too. Um,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I think what you have is, the way the, the justice system works is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty.#Statement-opinion
Oh, it's insane.#Statement-opinion
So many things in their back,#Statement-opinion
pardon?#Signal-non-understanding
It's insane.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
I know,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
my wife participated in a jury trial several years back#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
wherein the individual after it was over and they,#Other
.#Non-verbal
had came up with the maximum sentence#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the jury form they found out that, uh, the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which was theft of#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, property.#Other
Oh yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And yet, the as-, the attorney,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
for the prosecution could not enter these, uh, the good man's background into it.#Other
It was like,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
this was a first time offender.#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Whereas, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I think that's,#Other
It seems like ,#Statement-opinion
Those that should be in jail should be in jail#Statement-opinion
That's correct#Agree/Accept
and there's too much leniency,#Statement-opinion
there's too much, uh, um, underhanded, uh, things going on that the public are not aware of.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
And it seems as though we are, uh, giving the criminal the benefit, more than the victim.#Statement-opinion
The victim has been victimized twice, not only by the perpetrator of the crime but also,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
the courts that try to do the justice.#Other
Well, I think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a, a, unsavory reputation,#Statement-opinion
shall we say?#Rhetorical-Questions
I do not have any, I don't have an ounce in my body of credibility toward the, the judicial system in#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
the United States.#Other
Well, what you got is the situation wherein, uh, if you ever get in trouble, you want to hire the smartest, crookedest, lawyer you can find.#Statement-opinion
Isn't that terrible?#Backchannel in question form
And, uh, that's not the idea.#Statement-opinion
It's, the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that he committed, but to punish him for the crime he committed. * slash error#Other
Well, to punish him for the crime but also to try and reeducate the man's thinking.#Maybe/Accept-part
Yeah. *#Other
To get him out of that, uh, uh, criminal mind that he has and to direct,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
him into a more productive life.#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Well we have, uh, a situation again that I am familiar with where, uh, the son of an acquaintance of mine#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
was killed#Other
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
while trying to stop a robbery.#Other
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
how sad.#Appreciation
And the person that killed him was a young woman who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes, carrying a gun in her purse.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, anyway it'd get to the,#Statement-non-opinion
she was sentenced to jail#Statement-non-opinion
but then due to technicalities, she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Of course it took eighteen months for the thing, the trial to happen.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, then, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
there was a letter writing campaign that went in,#Other
and the Parole Board received approximately a thousand letters protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months after killing someone.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, fortunately it worked.#Statement-non-opinion
They, uh, elimi-, they corrected the technicality.#Statement-non-opinion
Well if,#Uninterpretable
And the person now will have to serve three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced to.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If enough of the public,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
responded to, uh, the dir-, the, uh, parties that are involved, and if enough,#Other
they will listen to the voice of the people.#Statement-opinion
I have found that out. That if enough people respond and rise up against the injustices being done, something is going to change.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
People have to be involved.#Statement-opinion
This is it#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and most people don't take the time.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Again the only reason I took the time is because I was personally acquainted#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
with these people.#Other
I'm just#Statement-non-opinion
You were,#Uninterpretable
as guilty as the rest in that respect.#Other
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Uh, but, and I'm not making an excuse#Statement-non-opinion
but we, our priorities are a bit backward.#Statement-opinion
Oh yes.#Agree/Accept
Well, they, again the,#Statement-opinion
and I'm not knocking the civil rights program or anything like that,#Statement-non-opinion
but we've gone,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
overboard to, uh, protect persons from being, having their civil rights,#Other
.#Non-verbal
violated to the point where the person that is damaged,#Other
.#Non-verbal
is not protected.#Other
It's again the victim gets worse punishment then the person,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that commits the crimes.#Other
That's correct.#Agree/Accept
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think we're both in agreement on this subject.#Statement-opinion
Well, I am too.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I mean I, I just can't.#Statement-non-opinion
I, you know, I served on a jury for a lady that was having a mental problem#Statement-non-opinion
and we found her not guilty because the lady obviously was not in their right mind.#Statement-non-opinion
So if the person is not in the right mind, I mean they had to, uh, put her away.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But for her own safety and for, because she didn't know what she was doing.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And we couldn't, we just dismissed the case.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Other
and, and, she was, uh, taken care of by the proper facility.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well another side of the coin that with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court.#Statement-opinion
There are a lot of things that could be settled out of court#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
which, uh, or should never have gone to court.#Other
And then the amazing thing, of course, is how, uh, some cases can come to trial in thirty days,#Statement-opinion
and others it takes eighteen months#Statement-opinion

Okay,#Other
do you want to start?#Yes-No-Question
Okay,#Agree/Accept
uh, I haven't, I don't know that much about the possi-, what the possible choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I think it works better than many other systems, like having a judge decide.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide, although it's difficult because they all have to be new-, unanimous.#Statement-opinion
Now that, do you, do you agree, that they should all be unanimous?#Yes-No-Question
I don't,#Uninterpretable
Or even, even in, uh, like they said, you know, lesser, you know, trials, you know, lesser convictions, do you think that they should be all unanimous still?#Or-Clause
I don't know,#Other answers
I don't know if I feel, I don't feel real strongly about that.#Statement-non-opinion
If the, uh,#Uninterpretable
the thing is, though, I, I didn't think even if it was a lower conviction, I didn't think that you could, uh, I didn't think that you really had to have a, a jury#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Unless, I guess, if you request one you can.#Statement-non-opinion
But I think,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
making it unanimous sometimes might, uh, let, the only thing, it might let more people get off.#Statement-opinion
I don't think it would convict any more people.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we have so many people already, you know,#Statement-opinion
the jails are already overloaded.#Statement-opinion
Well, the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean if one is determined that it's, you know, that he feels that he's, you know, going against the other eleven, they all stay until everyone agrees.#Statement-non-opinion
So I don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting, you know, just gives in.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, if it's,#Uninterpretable
no,#Reject
but they, they, what if they never agree.#Wh-Question
Doesn't it just, uh, do they have to go back and do a whole new trial#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
And they have to stay in until they all agree#Statement-non-opinion
Agree#Repeat-phrase
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know,#Hedge
I'm not sure if they go, I mean to twelve new people or what they do exactly,#Statement-non-opinion
but I do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before he can either, you know, either he or she can either go free or to jail, either one.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that maybe on the lesser crimes that aren't too severe, that's a little stringent#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Especially because there's twelve.#Statement-opinion
The thing about it is, I think jury selection, too,#Uninterpretable
a lot of times, uh, the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury#Statement-opinion
and they can sway them that way, too.#Statement-opinion
That's, that's just it.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't understand.#Statement-non-opinion
You're supposed to, you know, go in if you have, you know, like if you've never heard of the people before or anything,#Statement-opinion
but I don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are total, totally impartial to it.#Rhetorical-Questions
I know.#Agree/Accept
I don't think, well, I guess you really can't,#Statement-opinion
but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials, how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either.#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, but then, again, you know, they, the, one of the questions they asked is, should it just be decided by a judge#Statement-non-opinion
and that's kind of tricky, too, because a lot of positions the judges are in, they, they can't be fired, you know,#Statement-opinion
they have to, they stay till they retire#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements, too#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree.#Agree/Accept
I don't think it should be left up to the judge alone.#Statement-opinion
Not only, you know, that they have to stay in there,#Statement-non-opinion
but, hey,#Appreciation
how many times have you heard of judges being bought over.#Rhetorical-Questions
I know.#Agree/Accept
You know, so it, it's, I, I think, I think in, in the end, the judge has the presiding, you know, uh, vote.#Statement-opinion
I think he can be, you know, I, I don't know if it's the way it is in real life,#Statement-opinion
but I've seen it on T V where the juries go one way#Statement-non-opinion
and the judge to-, totally finds it obnoxious#Statement-non-opinion
and he completely, you know, goes the other way.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now, I'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what.#Statement-non-opinion
I think in some cases they are.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if it's, you know,#Other
so that's another thing where they have the power,#Statement-opinion
but maybe juries could be less than twelve people#Statement-non-opinion
or would that be more fair or less fair.#Rhetorical-Questions
Maybe there should be more than twelve people#Statement-opinion
I don't,#Uninterpretable
Oh, oh, my God.#Appreciation
If there were more than twelve, can you imagine how long they'd be sitting#Statement-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
I don't know.#Hedge
I, I think it's just, I don't, I mean, I think it's as fair as it can possibly get,#Statement-opinion
but I just think it's really har-, you know,#Statement-opinion
I mean, some cases go on for years, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
That's true,#Agree/Accept
and I've never been on jury duty,#Statement-non-opinion
but they have to keep going and going and going.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And lose their, not lose their jobs, but not go to work.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I don't know how it could be more fair.#Statement-non-opinion
Course, I don't know.#Hedge
Maybe#Statement-opinion
It could be,#Statement-opinion
maybe they should be asking someone that's been on, on trial before.#Other
Really,#Agree/Accept
I've never seen one in real life either#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't have, you know, I don't know that much about it,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think, it seems that we have a, a pretty fair system compared to other countries.#Statement-opinion
I don't know how we could make it more fair.#Statement-non-opinion
I really don't.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The unanimous vote is questionable, though.#Statement-opinion
And, and how, how many cases get juries might#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
want to be reviewed, too.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because, uh, I don't know if you should really have a jury for s-, a small infraction.#Statement-opinion
But I'm not sure who gets them#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know anything#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know that much about it either.#Statement-non-opinion
I just, I don't know.#Hedge
I, I guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail, you know, how they can make it more fair for them or not,#Statement-opinion
but then again, maybe they should be there#Statement-opinion
so that is fair.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't, I, I don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty, uh, unique#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think, when they started it.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, how long do we need to talk?#Wh-Question
Do you know?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, I think we can hang up anytime#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Uh, in, uh,#Uninterpretable
what do I do now?#Conventional-closing
Do you know?#Conventional-closing
Anything,#Conventional-closing
or just#Conventional-closing
No,#Conventional-closing
I don't#Conventional-closing
wait for someone else.#Other

Uh, taxes#Other
Do you want to go ahead?#Yes-No-Question
Sure.#Affirmative non-yes answers
We pay far too much in taxes.#Statement-opinion
Well, far too much for what we get.#Statement-opinion
I mean#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's just,#Other
I agree.#Agree/Accept
I don't know, it ju-, just seems too much of the money is just lost#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Well I think, uh, you know, when I look at, uh, all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money that's not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at a, at a better discount, uh,#Statement-opinion
when you, when,#Uninterpretable
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You mean like those, you know, twenty thousand dollar toilets ?#Yes-No-Question
Exactly,#Affirmative non-yes answers
exactly.#Affirmative non-yes answers
That's exactly, uh, the whole thing.#Statement-opinion
When you take a look at all those issues of where our money is going#Statement-opinion
and it's just,#Uninterpretable
as long as the person that's spending the money, uh, doesn't think about#Statement-opinion
oh, I can go out and spend anything that I want to#Quotation
it's just unlimited,#Quotation
Sure,#Agree/Accept
it's real easy to spend other people's money.#Yes-No-Question
Right?#Tag-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
An unlimited source#Statement-opinion
so they, they think well I'll go out and buy a four hundred toilet seat#Statement-opinion
and I could have went to K-Mart and bought it for, you know, ten or fifteen#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, that kind of thing#Statement-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Agree/Accept
E-, I don't mind them getting what they need.#Statement-non-opinion
It's just when they pay so much for it.#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
It takes you know, very little to just shop around and,#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
And I know a lot of, uh, corporations now are looking at their amount of money that's being spent#Statement-opinion
and they're looking#Statement-opinion
That's true#Agree/Accept
at what's the best buy.#Other
It used to be you could go, if you had a company you had to go through certain people#Statement-opinion
and you didn't care what you paid.#Statement-opinion
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean you just got it done.#Statement-opinion
Now people are putting in bids for things and are looking at things.#Statement-opinion
Going to actually shop at Best Buy for, Best Buy is one of our electronic stores#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for fax machines, things like that, instead of going through these office supply companies that mark up their amounts and say, you know, I'll give you a legal pad for five bucks,#Other
.#Non-verbal
and you can go to another shop and get it for maybe sixty cents or nin-, or ninety cents#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that kind of thing#Statement-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
I'm also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering like the world's probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years#Rhetorical-Questions
Except for everything keeps going up, you know.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And I know as a middle class, uh, you know,#Uninterpretable
and also I have one dependent has#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
my daughter#Other
and I keep looking at well where's the tax, so-called tax, uh, relief#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I know.#Agree/Accept
for having children.#Other
I mean, there is none#Statement-opinion
I mean, I think I paid just as much as when#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I know,#Agree/Accept
I mean I don't even,#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't have her,#Other
so#Uninterpretable
You know, I don't even get to see half my paycheck.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Between Four Oh One K and, and the thirty-four percent they're taking out for taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Agree/Accept
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Let alone what I end up having to pay#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's the whole thing.#Statement-opinion
Now they have gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but you're still going to owe the government as much money#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so by the end of this coming year, what's going to happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government#Statement-opinion
and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings, uh, account.#Statement-opinion
Nope,#Agree/Accept
they won't be able to pay.#Statement-opinion
They won't be able to pay it#Statement-opinion
and there'll be a lot of problems because of that, you know.#Statement-opinion
Put people into, you know, January or February which is always suppose to be,#Statement-opinion
the month after Christmas is supposed to be high spending because everything is on sale.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Nobody's going to have the money to spend.#Statement-opinion
Sure#Agree/Accept
none .#Agree/Accept
They're going to be paying on their taxes#Statement-opinion
so they're going to have to just cut back#Statement-opinion
so, I don't know where the answer is#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
I don't,#Uninterpretable
in the first place, you know, there's also like taxation without representation.#Statement-opinion
Well I don't feel represented anymore in our government.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's certainly not a government for me.#Other
It doesn't take care of my needs#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
no.#Agree/Accept
Well, that's the whole thing.#Statement-opinion
I think people are getting so fed up with it.#Statement-opinion
Now, we go through another election and listen to all these lies about the,#Statement-opinion
an-, and people don't care anymore either.#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
No.#Agree/Accept
People don't want to go out to vote.#Statement-opinion
Well, I don't think people think they can make a difference.#Statement-opinion
And when you've got candidates as you do.#Statement-opinion
It's candidates that have money#Statement-opinion
Yep.#Agree/Accept
and it's backed by big business.#Statement-opinion
And big business says well we don't care about the little person#Statement-opinion
and, uh, you know, you're not going to get anymore Abe Lincolns#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
but#Statement-opinion
around.#Other
but that, that's going to backfire because#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Well who knows, uh,#Rhetorical-Questions
yeah.#Uninterpretable
little people who buy everything,#Other
so#Uninterpretable
Generations from now we might, uh, set back in our little, uh, rocking chairs and watch our grandchildren go through an entirely different system of things and say, you know, this government itself isn't working.#Statement-opinion
Just like the communist government of, uh, the old U S S R.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And maybe that's going to happen to America where they'll say, hey#Statement-opinion
we're fed up.#Quotation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I wonder though#Maybe/Accept-part
Maybe it'll have to be just individual state tax.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And each state take care of itself and no government type of, uh, you know,#Statement-opinion
where you have to pay out to federal or whatever.#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
Who knows#Rhetorical-Questions
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm not#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
I can't think of any easy answers to it#Statement-non-opinion
but something has to happen,#Statement-opinion
I mean#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
I'm certainly fed up with it.#Other
Yeah#Agree/Accept
Everybody is,#Statement-opinion
in fact, I'm not sending in my check#Statement-non-opinion

Where have you been on a wonderful vacation?#Wh-Question
Well normally when we go on vacation we go home, to Colorado.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's where we go home, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Colorado Springs is where we're from.#Statement-non-opinion
That's where we go.#Statement-non-opinion
How funny.#Appreciation
Yes,#Agree/Accept
my husband's family lives just off of Academy Boulevard at Maize land.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Yes.#Yes answers
We live up, up, uh, Lake, in the Broadmoor area#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Uninterpretable
that's where my fam-, my in-laws are.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, we've been there.#Statement-non-opinion
We haven't skied at Broadmoor.#Statement-non-opinion
We went there last year at Christmas time#Statement-non-opinion
and it was twenty-seven below.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So we had to cancel our ski lessons#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as of you can't even ski there anymore.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
they closed it down.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, just this year?#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh#Yes answers
Oh, my,#Appreciation
they don't have enough money#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Uninterpretable
to keep it going,#Other
it doesn't, doesn't pay.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
So that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation, now#Statement-opinion
Well#Reject
if you were a skier.#Other
you know, well, now I don't know.#Other
Now Colorado Springs is real accessible to Lake Breckenridge#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's only a couple of hours away.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, so, it's, it might not be too bad if you want to go skiing somewhere else.#Statement-opinion
But, you can't, can't ski up there any more.#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, I'd like to go on vacation.#Statement-non-opinion
I c-, my husband and I want to go to Florida#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to go to Disney World,#Other
but we have two little ones#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that are under two right now,#Other
so we want to wait until they're a little bit older#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to do that,#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Well, we went on a family cruise last year, on the Premier Family Cruise Line#Statement-non-opinion
and then we went to Disney.#Statement-non-opinion
It was all part of the package.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And on the cruise ship they had Mickey and Minnie and Chip and Dale and Goofy and Donald Duck,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was really oriented toward little kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, how fun.#Appreciation
So the kids could eat with Chip and Dale, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know#Statement-opinion
Oh yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was just a lot of fun.#Other
Oh, I bet.#Appreciation
So then we were on the cruise for three days in the Bahamas,#Statement-non-opinion
and then landed at Cape Canaveral and then drove over to Orlando and spent four days at Disney.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow,#Appreciation
well that sounds pretty,#Appreciation
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that was the way to travel.#Statement-opinion
Yeah, that sounds pretty good.#Other
Yes.#Agree/Accept
And it was all a big package deal#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
where you just pay one price#Other
That's right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
and get everything?#Other
That's right,#Affirmative non-yes answers
and kids are really cheaper, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise,#Statement-non-opinion
so they said we could either cancel, reschedule, or take whatever was available.#Statement-non-opinion
So we took whatever was available,#Statement-non-opinion
and we left a day early,#Statement-non-opinion
and they put us up at the Cocoa Beach Hilton,#Statement-non-opinion
and the ship that was available, the only, uh, rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
So we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what a deal.#Other
So then our cruise was actually extended a day,#Statement-non-opinion
and our Disney was extended a day,#Statement-non-opinion
so we turned a seven day trip into ten#Statement-non-opinion
Great,#Appreciation
and they paid for everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's great.#Appreciation
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that was a wonderful vacation.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I bet.#Statement-opinion
That sounds like the way I'd want to do it#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think.#Other
Well, what kind of things do you like to do when you go to Colorado?#Open-Question
Oh, well, we like to ski, of course,#Statement-non-opinion
so we spend so much time with our families#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, and seeing our friends,#Other
because we moved to Texas about two years ago. So when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so we don't, we don't get a lot of time to just vacation.#Statement-non-opinion
We did, um, last year, though, go to San Antonio for Memorial Day#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which was fun just to get to kind of walk around#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing.#Other
Uh, but, you know, other, other than that, with, with both my kids being under two, it's real hard#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to do any, any kind of#Other
That would be,#Uninterpretable
events that, uh#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
don't, don't require as much,#Other
I know,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think one of the places I always hit in Colorado, is that current outlet store.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's funny *#Statement-opinion
That's what,#Signal-non-understanding
funny#Other
you should mention that,#Other
I just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, with the Santa Claus on the cover.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've already ordered from that one,#Statement-non-opinion
but we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Oh, do you live, where do you,#Wh-Question
what state are you in?#Wh-Question
Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you're in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
I'm in the Dallas area.#Statement-non-opinion
So am I.#Statement-non-opinion
In Plano.#Other
I'm in Garland.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that's not too far.#Other
I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or something the other day.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I guess they get people from all over.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
driving for Thanksgiving, that's going to be quite a drive for,#Statement-opinion
Well it was when we left last year.#Agree/Accept
We left on the eighteenth, right before that big snow storm hit Colorado#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we pulled in just as it hit.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
So, how do you go?#Wh-Question
Do you go up through the Raton Pass, when you go up there?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, no,#No answers
Ret-, oh,#Uninterpretable
well, wait a minute,#Hold before answer/agreement
yeah,#Yes answers
we do,#Statement-non-opinion
we do.#Statement-non-opinion
That's on like Route two eighty-seven or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then we go straight up through Trinidad#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
and straight up I Twenty-five from there.#Other
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
we, uh, went a different way when we went last Christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little U Haul trailer,#Statement-non-opinion
because we had to take our dog in the car, there was no room for luggage.#Statement-non-opinion
So, we went all interstate.#Statement-non-opinion
We went up, um, through Oklahoma City#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then up through, uh, Kansas, and then turned left and went in on I Seventy#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour.#Statement-non-opinion
It was a little more mile wise#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but because you could go sixty-five miles an hour on the,#Statement-non-opinion

So, uh, what things do you consider an invasion of privacy?#Open-Question
Ooh, well I don't know.#Other answers
What do you think?#Open-Question
Oh, I don't know.#Other answers
I had a little bit more time to think about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I was thinking of, like, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
I was ju-, started to think about all the big, you know, data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and all those, you know, demographics studies that they do that, um, you know, have, who knows, how much, you know, stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere#Other
and I don't know,#Hedge
I don't know how much the stuff actually, what they actually have in there#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know they use that, I mean they sell those,#Other
Well what about, uh, required drug testing, uh, as a, uh, condition of employment?#Open-Question
Yeah,#Hold before answer/agreement
that was, that, that was the other one I was thinking of#Statement-non-opinion
I think that's, uh,#Uninterpretable
I mean I know drugs are illegal.#Statement-non-opinion
It thing actually.#Uninterpretable
Uh, I, uh, have worked at Texas Instruments.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh. Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, they instituted a drug policy there. Drug testing policy where they randomly would test, uh, employees#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and actually, to tell you the truth, I really did not think much about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I hadn't, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it really didn't relate to me.#Statement-non-opinion
But there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they, they get a false positive, you know, what recourse do you have.#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, also, uh, uh, this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing, this kind of big brother activity#Statement-opinion
and yet, uh, a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments, although they don't admit to it, it's actually, oh, a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So what that means is, to me, that really it's the government that's requiring this,#Statement-opinion
although they don't actually e-, execute it themselves, it's really the government that .#Statement-opinion
So, in that sense, it, at least, philosophically, it's really borderline legal.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I, I think the, I think that, you know, a person's competence should be more determined by, you know, their actions and their behavior#Statement-opinion
and if they're, you know, if they're on some kind of, you know, contol-, controlled substance then, you know, it kinds of takes away from the job of, you know, the supervisor or manager type person, you know, who is able to evaluate them.#Statement-opinion
I think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a, you know, a chemical, you know,#Statement-opinion
Well, what about this, uh, AIDS epidemic now?#Rhetorical-Questions
Where you find that, uh, uh, you know, certain people are actually are, are criminal in their disregard for it-,#Statement-opinion
These people that are carriers and don't#Yes-No-Question
others.#Other
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
and#Statement-opinion
that don't reveal it?#Other
and, uh, of course, the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't,#Other
.#Non-verbal
it, uh, it destroys their libido.#Statement-opinion
Yeah, tha-, that would be kind of an extreme.#Statement-opinion
Now, uh, you know if they ever,#Uninterpretable
I mean I've heard of things like, you know, making them, you know, marking them somehow or, you know, or something like that or, you know, putting them all someplace like in a kind of,#Statement-non-opinion
So what about that as an invasion of privacy?#Open-Question
Yeah.#Hold before answer/agreement
Wel-, I guess it kind of borders on where, I mean what do you value more. The invasion of, uh, the person's privacy or the possible danger to, you know, other people.#Statement-opinion
So really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it i-, gets to balancing, uh, personal freedom against, uh, the general welfare#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
of society.#Other
I guess that's alwa-, that's been the big role of government, I guess I mean generally.#Statement-opinion
Well, it, it's supposed to have been.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well, that's kind of a difficult one to go into.#Statement-opinion
I mean that, that particular case.#Statement-opinion
No,#Reject
it ,#Uninterpretable
Because I mean, there's a lot of people that, uh, I mean they could require, you know, ob-, obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because I'm, you know, there's a huge part of the population,#Statement-opinion
not a huge part but a, you know#Statement-opinion
A growing part.#Collaborative Completion
the AIDS population I guess that have it, that don't know they do#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
are spreading it.#Other
But, again, to require, you know, such a test and jus-, and then to make, make it is to subject them to, to discrimi-, discriminatory practices and other things.#Statement-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
uh, I don't know how exactly I feel about that.#Statement-non-opinion
Maybe chop their weenies off.#Statement-opinion

Okay.#Other
Uh, so, what do you think, uh, about putting the elderly in a nursing home?#Open-Question
Well, I think that it, it varies on on the individual basis.#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
Uh, sometimes it is, there is no alternative.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you do not have, uh, uh, family available or family that's, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
you may not even have family that is, uh, uh, in, you know, who are around.#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
So, sometimes it's not an alternative.#Statement-opinion
Huh#Uninterpretable
And I think, uh, but I think also, sometimes it can be, uh, a benefit if it's for a short time.#Statement-opinion
Sometimes in a nursing home#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, especially if, if it's after an acute illness.#Statement-opinion
To get over a,#Uninterpretable
or to rehab after, uh, an illness.#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
I never thought of that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
Sometimes you know, sometimes the nursing homes are good for, uh, just short periods of time.#Statement-opinion
That's true,#Agree/Accept
until they get over that hump#Summarize/reformulate
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
of whatever it is they're dealing with.#Other
Because too often the acute hospitals will, are sending them out much faster than what they're#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
really able to.#Other
They really are.#Statement-opinion
They don't like to keep them#Statement-opinion
So#Statement-opinion
longer than a week.#Other
so there is some good to it.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, sometimes too, it's used as a dumb job.#Statement-opinion
You know the fam-,#Statement-opinion
What do you mean?#Signal-non-understanding
well the families do not necessarily uh, know what to do with them#Other
and they don't want to take the responsibility#Statement-opinion
so they will put them in a nursing home.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Statement-opinion
So you see, uh,#Other
there's both sides to it too.#Statement-opinion
What do you think?#Open-Question
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it depends on how, how sick the person is too. What you're capable of, like if you have a family to take care of, you know, of your own#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Repeat-phrase
uh, I would personally like it#Statement-non-opinion
if my parents were to get ill, I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help.#Statement-non-opinion
That's not always possible.#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
But, uh, to the best of my ability, I'd like to do it until it gets impossible#Statement-non-opinion
I think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to,#Statement-opinion
it's there's not a choice, it's#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because, it's not economically feasible even to#Other
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
put them in a nursing home.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that, that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the, uh, either Medicare or insurance to cover it.#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
So,#Uninterpretable
But I think nursing homes can be good.#Statement-opinion
It just depends on what kind they are.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, you need to check them out ahead of time.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then there's also some that are set up for specialties#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I know some.#Statement-non-opinion
Unfortunately, some elderly have to go to or have, I guess it's Alzheimer's or where#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they wonder or, or, uh, confused or have some mental problem#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that they're#Uninterpretable
And you need a special nursing home for that.#Statement-opinion
You need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you need people who are trained for that type#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
of problem.#Other
Who know what they're doing with that.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah#Agree/Accept
so, so there's different types of nursing homes I think.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, my, uh, grandmother's not really in a nursing home, but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it.#Statement-non-opinion
And she really liked the idea of, of moving there.#Statement-non-opinion
She's not ill yet#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years#Statement-non-opinion
and then she decided that, uh, she's eighty five years old, that eventually, you know, she she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden.#Statement-non-opinion
She's very independent.#Statement-non-opinion
So she's in this nursing home.#Statement-non-opinion
It's out in the country#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook#Statement-non-opinion
Gives her a little bit of her own independence#Summarize/reformulate
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
but she still has, uh, a security there.#Summarize/reformulate
Right.#Agree/Accept
Some support.#Summarize/reformulate
And then there's also, uh, sort of a wing for those people that do get sick#Statement-non-opinion
and, what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now#Statement-non-opinion
and then, so if she ever does become ill, uh, it will be like family around her.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right#Appreciation
and I#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've seen some of them like that too#Other
and also they have a lot of, uh, activities going on for the ones#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
who are more active.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sh-,#Uninterpretable
So it's not sort of like, uh, uh#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a sick place.#Other
No,#Agree/Accept
she loves it.#Statement-non-opinion
She has a great social life#Statement-non-opinion
and she travels#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it's in, in the very in the mountains#Statement-non-opinion
and it's beautiful#Statement-opinion
and, uh, I, I hope that I have something like that when I get older#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I think, I think the, uh#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the, uh, elderly#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, person who's going in and the family that's going to be, uh, effec-, effected by it#Other
Oh definitely it's,#Agree/Accept
and, uh, you know, sometimes it can, those choi-, those choices can be made in advance#Statement-non-opinion
and sometimes#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're,#Other

Well it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
I'll start off here.#Offers, Options Commits
Uh, I don't know.#Hedge
I get, probably, most of my information either from the newspaper or from C N N.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I like C N N because it, uh, you know, repeats it,#Statement-non-opinion
well HEADLINE NEWS repeats every half hour#Statement-non-opinion
but it#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
makes it really convenient cause I keep a rather hectic schedule#Other
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
but the newspaper p-, provides a little bit of depth#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you can't really get from,#Other
I, I think I'd agree.#Agree/Accept
A, a s-, similar method of getting the news with me too.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, uh, uh, C N N has been a welcome addition to the T V scene here in the,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
last, uh, number of years.#Other
Uh, p-, prior to cable, you know, you didn't get much news off of normal, uh, television broadcasts.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature#Statement-opinion
and, and I like, uh, C N N because you get some world, world events too#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, which is not too common on, on the other format, newspapers, and so forth.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know, the,#Uninterpretable
my only major objection is that, uh, I don't think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada.#Statement-opinion
Uh,#Uninterpretable
That, that's true, you know.#Agree/Accept
You hardly ever see, uh, headline articles about the, uh, either the economics or, or other wor-, news events going on in either of those countries.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, whereas if you pick up a, a European paper, you know, uh, it, all the surrounding countries, Soviet Union, and everything has, uh, major news, uh, articles in them.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, you know, Canada has gone through a lot of problems now with, with Quebec and, and everything#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it's amazing that,#Statement-opinion
you know, I, I listen to D C area and the WASHINGTON POST, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean the most they'll give it is the back of the A section.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you know.#Uninterpretable
I'm, I'm currently living in Dallas#Statement-non-opinion
and it, it won't even give it the back section#Statement-non-opinion
You just,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
never see, you just never see anything about it,#Other
uh, which is a shame because you go to other countries, uh,#Statement-opinion
and, and they carry quite a bit about the U S on the other hand.#Statement-opinion
And if you go up to, uh, Canada, those people are usually pretty, uh, familiar with the politics going on and and the#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
news U S#Other
and we're pretty, uh, limited in our understanding of, of leaders up in Canada or Mexico.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
definitely.#Agree/Accept
You just don't know what's going on.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'd, I,#Uninterpretable
every once in awhile, I have to travel overseas#Statement-non-opinion
and lately I've taken the, taken a little shortwave radio, uh, around and picking up the B B C#Statement-non-opinion
and it's sort of like, uh, a C N N too.#Statement-opinion
You#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you can tune into some stations#Other
and you get some, like thirty minute summaries of, of news events.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I occasionally get into some of the middle eastern, uh, area#Statement-non-opinion
and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
There's not much in the way of television in some#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of those places.#Other
Uh, but that's a good point about, about the neighboring countries.#Statement-opinion
I hadn't really thought about it#Statement-non-opinion
but I guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, well part of it, touring.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, you know, i-, I was amazed cause I'd pick up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting things going on.#Statement-opinion
There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, because of the problems with Quebec#Other
and n-, I had never heard any of that before.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, there was, a, a,#Uninterpretable
what is it called,#Wh-Question
is it Meech Lake Accord?#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Or, or, i-, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of#Statement-opinion
and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it.#Statement-non-opinion
And, and c-, came ,#Uninterpretable
it was a big thing going on there#Statement-non-opinion
and I came back here#Statement-non-opinion
and nothing in the papers.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I didn't see a thing about it.#Statement-non-opinion
So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I guess.#Statement-opinion
It's improved.#Statement-opinion
And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news.#Statement-non-opinion
Even, even there's, uh, uh,#Uninterpretable
it's sor-, it's semireligious in some respects.#Statement-non-opinion
But what is it?#Wh-Question
It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel.#Statement-non-opinion
The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I, it surprised me.#Statement-non-opinion
I've caught it a few times#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they do some pretty good news.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, seemingly unbiased news broadcasts.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, the, the title of the network is sort of surprising.#Other
You'd think it would carry mostly religious#Statement-opinion
but it, it doesn't seem to.#Statement-opinion
So I'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too, uh, and catch something maybe a little different than, than C N N might be covering.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, some more in-, interest type topics in, in other countries.#Statement-non-opinion
But it's kind of world, world, uh, network too.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I, I guess I've never seen the T V show.#Statement-non-opinion
I used to get the, uh,#Statement-non-opinion

Um, I don't,#Other
I am only twenty-eight#Statement-non-opinion
and I haven't had much experience with nursing homes.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't, I have never visited any of them#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I don't think I've ever even been in one.#Statement-non-opinion
Have you?#Yes-No-Question
Um, actually I have, um, I've, I've been in them but, um, just visiting#Affirmative non-yes answers
and, uh, we used to g-, when we were like in, in our teen ages#Statement-non-opinion
we'd go on Sundays and visit, you know, the older people.#Statement-non-opinion
But, um, I have an elderly grandma that lives with us.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And she's lived with us for like five years.#Statement-non-opinion
So I kind of know how it is to, how to decide if you want to put somebody in a rest home#Statement-non-opinion
or, um, like we, I mean we've had those discussions, you know, about should we put her in or because she's pretty senile#Statement-non-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
And it, it takes a lot of care#Statement-opinion
like twenty-four hours a day someone,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
has to be,#Other
It's rea-,#Uninterpretable
Well, there's someone in my, my fiancee's family.#Other
His grandmother too and they're, that hi-, her son, his uncle, whatever, you know, anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
He, he has, he's recently retired#Statement-non-opinion
and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke#Statement-non-opinion
and, and all the other children are working or whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They're all my parents age.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, so he's got, you know, his retirement though is really twenty-four hours a day.#Statement-non-opinion
They have a day care two days a week.#Statement-non-opinion
They call it senior citizen day care.#Statement-non-opinion
But she goes in the senior citizen center.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
So sh-, he gets a break two days a week#Statement-non-opinion
but it's only for like two or three hours at a time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, just, you see a lot of things like you, you know, was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired,#Statement-non-opinion
and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But he refuses to consider any other,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't,#Uninterpretable
To put her in a rest home?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
and is that how your parents feel#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Um, well, see it's more my grandma that feels that way.#Dispreferred answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
She says that when her husband died that he said, oh, that my uncle had said that he would never ha-, put her in a rest home.#Statement-non-opinion
So it's kind of, uh,#Uninterpretable
I don't know.#Hedge
I mean, I don't, I don't think my parents would#Statement-non-opinion
but she is getting pretty bad#Statement-non-opinion
like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's,#Other
and my mom has to take care of her pretty much#Statement-non-opinion
so it gets,#Uninterpretable
I don't know.#Hedge
It's, it's a hard decision,#Statement-opinion
but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally#Statement-non-opinion
I know at this,#Uninterpretable
I know I feel like I would never do that with my parents either, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
But I, I really feel bad for the people I see th-, not very,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not really, really experienced#Statement-non-opinion
but like I said I just have that one family,#Statement-non-opinion
and I just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now#Statement-non-opinion
and, than he thought it would be.#Statement-non-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
When he retired?#Wh-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
and he's got, you know, seven brothers and sisters#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, uh, he's the one because he's the one that isn't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone.#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's like that good for us just because my uncle and my, and my mom switch off like we have her for three months#Statement-non-opinion
and then he has her for three months.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, that's great.#Appreciation
So that,#Statement-non-opinion
That's a good idea.#Appreciation
We ought to,#Uninterpretable
that works out good.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever, I don't know what they're going to do.#Statement-non-opinion
It's really not my family.#Statement-non-opinion
It's my fiancee's#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't, I can't say much.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I always feel like I would never put my parents in either#Statement-non-opinion
and I wonder, I'm going to be the only sibling that isn't going to have children#Statement-non-opinion
so if my parents do need to live with someone, it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
You know,#Other
and I'm, I,#Uninterpretable
that's fine with me.#Statement-non-opinion
I-, my fiancee and I both figure that's what's, we're going to end up with both of the parents or whoever.#Statement-non-opinion
If the-,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
You know what I mean?#Rhetorical-Questions
We feel like,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's our responsibility,#Other
and I feel like I would never put them in a home.#Statement-non-opinion
But I wonder how much, you know, if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You think about it#Statement-opinion
and it's really,#Uninterpretable
I don't know.#Hedge
This country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country.#Statement-opinion
You think?#Backchannel in question form
I, I#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Statement-opinion
I'm not really familiar with how other countries,#Other
It's really more of a, um, like a respect issue th-, that the older, older people in other countries that I've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people#Other
and, and they really seem as wise#Statement-opinion
and, and in this country nobody really,#Statement-opinion
They're seen as senile#Statement-opinion
Yeah, nobody really pays attention#Other
and they, oh, the old-timer made with the old way#Statement-opinion
and nobody respects the traditions.#Statement-opinion
And, you know, it's I,#Uninterpretable
I'm not saying that I do either#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, it's just funny#Other
and, and we really don't have any that don't have the Social Security#Statement-opinion
and everything really isn't that much#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for elderly people to live on.#Other
You know, even if they're in good health it's incredible.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They don't have any,#Statement-opinion
they don't get special treatment and maybe they should, you know#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because we're all going to get old someday.#Other
I know.#Agree/Accept
And so it's a, it's kind of a depressing topic though.#Statement-opinion
How old are you?#Wh-Question
Um, I'm twenty.#Statement-non-opinion
So it is, yeah, and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
it's,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
it really is#Other
but, and she, she drives us craz-,#Statement-non-opinion

I, I, I, assume you have kids#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh, we have one.#Affirmative non-yes answers
She's only nine months old.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well she, she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, my degree is in teaching,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well,#Statement-opinion
.#Other
we have a little bit of a basis for conversation.#Other
I was a substitute teacher for about a year.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, uh, thought I wanted to be a teacher#Statement-non-opinion
so, but before I went through all of that I wanted to see how I was going to like it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and they, uh,#Uninterpretable
in Alabama, where I came from they, they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree.#Statement-non-opinion
So I went out and played substitute for a while and decided, nope, not for me.#Statement-non-opinion
Did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels#Declarative Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Yes answers
It was,#Uninterpretable
I just took grades one through six.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I thought I was going to be smart and get the good kids, wrong.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, my degree was in fourth through seventh grade#Statement-non-opinion
but I taught junior high.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And I expected it to be a lot of trouble#Statement-non-opinion
but it wasn't that bad,#Statement-non-opinion
I taught remedial reading kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
And, well, they don't call it remedial reading these days,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they call it something else.#Other
But, but, anyway, at the time that's what I taught.#Statement-non-opinion
And, um, you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when you have your slow readers#Other
but it, it wasn't too bad.#Statement-non-opinion
We, we got long real well.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I, I sometimes wonder if I didn't mess up.#Statement-non-opinion
I maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can, if you have to you can get mean with them.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Those little kids don't understand it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
especially with the real young ones.#Statement-non-opinion
I started out wanting to teach ele-, lower, like primary and then top primary and thought, well, no, I don't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth#Statement-non-opinion
and so that's what I got my certification in.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I had decided long before I was even married that I wanted to, if possible, teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, and my reason for that was I don't like the, uh, what's the right word. The varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's a nice way of putting it.#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
You can find a lot of good public schools if you, if you look real hard#Statement-opinion
but I don't think they could cover everything that you could teach,#Statement-opinion
Exact-, exactly,#Appreciation
your children on an individual basis.#Other
And too, most people don't have that option.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know. And plus it also depends on the district your in as, I mean, on the,#Statement-opinion
I've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, accept for the private ones, of course, we're talking about public.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know#Hedge
Back when I was going to school uh, you just didn't get away with the things these kids get away with now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean you, you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and, uh, usually bending over to get five of the best,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, but now, nowadays they can't even, they can barely scold the children for something, you know, without getting sued.#Statement-opinion
And the, the, um, the crime is just escalated and the drugs and,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even in the, the, the lower, the lower schools.#Other
Well, the thing that really did it for me, I was subbing in a fifth grade class#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, this kid comes to school with his lunch box#Statement-non-opinion
and inside this lunch box he, he's got easily two, I'd say two hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
And I asked him, uh, what are you doing with that?#Statement-non-opinion
And he says, "My father gave it to me."#Statement-non-opinion
And I didn't believe it for a minute.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, so, uh, but, uh, you know, the,#Uninterpretable
not a lot I could do about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants.#Statement-non-opinion
Crazy for him to#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Well, I have,#Uninterpretable
I, I, I've full-,#Uninterpretable
I think I understood what the, what the kid was doing he was a, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
well let's just say he was one of th-, those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But not a lot I could do about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, we had the problem when I was in,#Statement-non-opinion
with teaching, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I was eighth and ninth graders that I worked with#Statement-non-opinion
and if we did have a, a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you don't know if you were reaching them or not#Statement-non-opinion
but we felt like, you know, maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them was bet-, trying to teach them was better than have them taken out.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because, uh, uh, that just,#Uninterpretable
that doesn't do a lot for them.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
alleviates your problem#Other
but it doesn't do anything for them.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, most the time if they were, they were,#Statement-non-opinion
some of them were even better behaved.#Statement-non-opinion
I've only had two instances where I cou-, it was really noticeable#Statement-non-opinion
but they were better behaved when they were, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if was alcohol or something else that they were on#Statement-non-opinion
but it ended up better#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Uh, I don't know,#Hedge
guns and,#Uninterpretable
I don't know#Hedge
it's something.#Statement-opinion
I think there's a problem too with teachers trying to, um, to be so versatile that they do loose sight of the basics, you know,#Statement-opinion
they've been a big drive in, especially in the seventies to return back to the basics.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, and I'm not completely just, you know, just teach the basics in schools#Statement-non-opinion
but I think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because,#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of our, our lower grades in the standardized test and such.#Other
Oh, sure.#Appreciation
I mean, i-, i-, it's indicative across the board that we, we've done something wrong.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And when you see, uh, Koreans and Chinese and Japanese who are taking all the, uh, science jobs, all the engineering jobs, all the mathematical jobs#Statement-opinion
and, you know, here we are#Statement-opinion
we can't, we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I don't know.#Hedge
Well, I spent a year and a half in Japan also#Statement-non-opinion
and I've seen how their school system works#Statement-non-opinion
and I,#Uninterpretable
they go by a complete rote system,#Statement-non-opinion
you just memorize everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then at the end of the, of a certain time period you spitted everything back out#Statement-non-opinion
and the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I don't completely agree with that either.#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
But there,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's, that's a great deal what law school's like#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, is it?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
Is that what you ended up going into?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
And, uh, I did the same sort of thing,#Statement-non-opinion
they just,#Uninterpretable
you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases#Statement-non-opinion
and then you get one examine for the whole semester#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's how well you can remember it all.#Statement-non-opinion
How, how much can you stuff in your brain.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I found that a particularly useless way of studying.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I never did.#Statement-non-opinion
I always tried to understand things, not tried to memorize.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And consequently some of the very best students were, had excellent memories#Statement-non-opinion
but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It didn't show me anything.#Statement-non-opinion
A year and a half, I gave it up.#Statement-non-opinion
I wasn't really wa-,#Uninterpretable
I didn't want to be a lawyer anyway,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just wanted the degree.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well,#Uninterpretable
Well,#Uninterpretable
I don't know.#Hedge
What can we do about it?#Backchannel in question form
Goo-, good question#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
Probably,#Uninterpretable
Money,#Statement-opinion
Taking,#Uninterpretable
Money is not the answer.#Other
No.#Agree/Accept
There's plenty of money in the system,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's just,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, the-, they're throwing more money at it now than ever before#Statement-opinion
and things are getting worse.#Statement-opinion
I think it's like a lot of things in the, in the United States.#Statement-opinion
We've got so much built up in, um, in the, in the, uh, bureaucracy and in the politics of it,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and in the, the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again#Statement-opinion
and there's no way that, that can be done.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Not without wiping out a whole generation of, of kids in the school system,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Maybe on smaller, smaller scales.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I don't know#Hedge
I, uh,#Uninterpretable
as much as I didn't like school when I was going through it,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
from my perspective now I can see that it's a lot better than what we have now.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, I mean, it's, it's silly that these, that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right into the classroom it needs to be#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
be able#Other
Exactly,#Appreciation
to be enforced.#Other
I mean, I, I mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to students because they're going get, they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something.#Other
It's like doctors in lawsuits,#Statement-opinion
Oh yeah.#Appreciation
you know, they're kind of fearful of,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
everything.#Other
Well, lawyers help create that#Statement-opinion
That's, that's,#Uninterpretable
well, at least I've heard that#Statement-non-opinion
I, I, I haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
been applicable to me#Other
but ,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I think, I think, I, I mean what we've turned the school schools into now are just day-care centers#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
you know, somebody,#Uninterpretable
okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day#Statement-non-opinion
and he's out of our hair.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, they're just,#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah#Appreciation
it has to be reinforced in the home.#Statement-opinion
Oh, sure.#Appreciation
I, I#Uninterpretable
you,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you can, you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get any-, anything at home then it's, it's not going to help either.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I don't know,#Hedge
I don't know,#Hedge
I don't know what the answer is.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's an interesting, interesting thing you want to do.#Statement-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools,#Open-Question
do they allow it?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
They allow it under certain circumstances.#Statement-non-opinion
You have to, to prove that you're teaching them something.#Statement-non-opinion
You have to follow,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a preferred curriculum,#Other
um, they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be, they're kind of monitored.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, they, they will allow you to,#Statement-non-opinion
I can't think of any examples#Statement-non-opinion
but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence.#Statement-non-opinion
And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't think they're were in this area#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, they, they are monitored by the, um, by the State School Board.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
So.#Uninterpretable
That's interesting.#Appreciation
I remembering reading a few cases about that when it, when some people first tried that and they got sued.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Got taken to court by the school system.#Other
I'm glad the parents won.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it seems silly that, um, we started#Statement-opinion
that's, that's the way you got your education in this country.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then, um,#Uninterpretable

We're supposed to talk about the Middle East Crisis,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and should we be involved and, uh, what's it going to cost us in the long run.#Other
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Are you ready?#Yes-No-Question
I guess so.#Affirmative non-yes answers
The Middle East Crisis should we be there?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, dear that's a hard one.#Hold before answer/agreement
That's really hard for me because, uh, you know, I really, I have a son that's sixteen#Statement-non-opinion
and I think, you know, eventually, you know, he'll be of, of drafting age.#Statement-non-opinion
And I think gosh, do I want him to go#Statement-non-opinion
and yet I'm proud to be an American#Statement-non-opinion
and I know that we have a country that, you know, people would give anything to live in, a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have.#Statement-opinion
And yet, I don't know whether I'd be willing to give his life for, for this country#Statement-non-opinion
and yet, and yet, I know that I, that,#Hedge
and I, I, when I was in school it was always the tired, the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm not sure that that's the reason anymore. I mean, not sure that communism is, is as strong as it once was.#Statement-opinion
And I'm not sure that, that that's the reason why we're, like we were in Vietnam supposedly so.#Statement-opinion
Well, you realize why we were in the Middle East. Why we invaded Iraq, why we were#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, with the,#Uninterpretable
in Saudi, why we attacked Kuwait and we we're, why we are still fighting Iraq.#Other
Well, it's because of oil isn't it?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
I really believe it's because,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it has something to do with oil, don't get me wrong.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But Saddam is, Saddam is a madman.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
I agree with that.#Statement-non-opinion
Anyone that would use chemical weapons to fight his own people,#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he's, uh, a bad person, very definitely,#Statement-opinion
And,#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
obviously, that has something to do with it.#Other
Oh, sure.#Agree/Accept
And, and if, you know,#Uninterpretable
I can see that he was in Kuwait#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Kuwait was the nonaggressor#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the Saudis are our allies.#Statement-non-opinion
We have several treaties and several alliances with the Saudis that range back for probably forty years.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
many years.#Summarize/reformulate
You know they've been our friends through thick and thin.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They,#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
were at the Saudi border.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And ready to storm into Saudi.#Other
Shouldn't we try and help our friends?#Yes-No-Question
Certainly,#Affirmative non-yes answers
but what at, at what cost, you know,#Rhetorical-Questions
that's the, uh, the thing, it came out, it came out wonderfully supposedly#Statement-opinion
I mean everything is#Uninterpretable
What did we lose,#Rhetorical-Questions
and we won.#Statement-non-opinion
forty-one Americans,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
lives.#Other
and that, that's wonderful#Statement-opinion
but what if, if that wasn't the case.#Rhetorical-Questions
What if we would have lost thousands of young men.#Rhetorical-Questions
Would that, would it have been too much of a price to pay for that?#Rhetorical-Questions
I don't know.#Statement-non-opinion
See, and I think there are a lot of things that we don't know#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Oh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that,#Other
of course,#Statement-opinion
the American people,#Uninterpretable
our government is full of liars, thieves, and crooks.#Other
Oh, sure.#Agree/Accept
Well, and there's a lot,#Statement-opinion
And that's,#Statement-opinion
that we,#Other
our own fault because we elected them.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I think that's true#Statement-opinion
but I think there's a lot that we, the public doesn't need to know.#Statement-opinion
I think there's some things we shouldn't know just for nation-, national security sake.#Statement-opinion
And I, you know, I think if we did know I think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because I don't, I don't think people could handle it.#Statement-opinion
So I think there are things that we should not know, the masses shouldn't know#Statement-opinion
but I also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
I went on jury duty here not long back.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And uh, one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if, if you could believe a lawyer or if a,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed#Other
and one guy being selected snickered and couldn't keep his head up, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the guy said, Well, can you share it with us what you, what you find so funny?#Statement-non-opinion
He says, Well, I already told you my sons a lawyer.#Statement-non-opinion
He said that when he graduated, the day after his bar examine#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there in Houston.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He told him, Dad, you know how to tell when a lawyers lying to you?#Statement-non-opinion
His lips are moving.#Quotation
Oh, my gosh#Appreciation

And ninety percent of all politicians,#Statement-opinion

and lawyers,#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Have a lawyer background,#Summarize/reformulate
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Have a law background,#Summarize/reformulate
you're right.#Statement-opinion
So by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars.#Statement-opinion
The fact that they take our money and don't do what we think is right makes them thieves.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
that's true.#Statement-opinion
So what's it going to cost us in the long run there in Saudi?#Wh-Question
Are we going to lose more lives there?#Yes-No-Question
See, and I don't know, I don't know I can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean I thought the war was going to go on and on.#Statement-opinion
I really was surprised when it ended so quickly#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Well, we hit them with more in one month than we used in three years, the last three years of Vietnam.#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
And whenever you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's nothing they can do about it.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know it's not like we threw eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We were there,#Statement-non-opinion
the Brits were there.#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and to some level even Russia was behind.#Statement-non-opinion

Right,#Agree/Accept
they were.#Statement-non-opinion
So honestly if there is, was a well perceived war, world wide this was it.#Statement-opinion
Oh, sure.#Agree/Accept
Sure.#Agree/Accept
But what I can't understand is then many of the Kuwaiti youth didn't fight, wouldn't fight.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's okay for us to go extend our youth's lives like so much water in the desert.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's not their job to fight for their own land.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that is very it's very strange.#Statement-opinion
Uh, and yet, you know, see that's another thing that, that's difficult for Americans,#Statement-opinion
their culture is so much different than ours, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I've heard from many people that we could not even begi-, begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, they just don't think the same way we do.#Statement-opinion
Their culture is completely different and almost opposite.#Statement-opinion
And really from all I can indica-, from all indications the Iraqi beliefs, if you will, are more similar to our own.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
that's true.#Agree/Accept
And the Kuwaitis aren't even helping rebuild their own country.#Statement-non-opinion
The Kuwaiti young won't rebuild anything.#Statement-opinion
They won't work.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I didn't realize that.#Statement-non-opinion

I don't know the answers to those questions.#Statement-non-opinion
I think they're tough#Statement-opinion

but I would still like to see it.#Statement-non-opinion
I'd like to see, uh, Italy.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I would love to go there.#Statement-non-opinion
That would be nice.#Appreciation
And, course, there is a lot of places in the United States I still want to come, you know, go to.#Statement-non-opinion
Now, have you been to Yellowstone?#Yes-No-Question
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Yellowstone,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Yes answers
yes.#Yes answers
Have you?#Yes-No-Question
We have been there.#Affirmative non-yes answers
We, I was there as a child and then we, we went to California and came back through Yellowstone with our kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they loved it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
I was in Utah, in Salt Lake City when I was a, uh, youngster.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, you know, I've touched on that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now I'm just about, oh, a half hour, uh, north of Salt Lake.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, it's at#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
my husband works in Salt Lake,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we're real close#Statement-non-opinion
and, yeah,#Uninterpretable
we,#Uninterpretable
Now that's a pretty city.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
we, we like it.#Statement-non-opinion
Very clean.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Other
It is.#Statement-non-opinion
Utah is a pretty state from what I remember of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, we kind of like it#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Well, do you like to camp, those kind of trips?#Yes-No-Question
We,#Uninterpretable
no,#No answers
we used to#Statement-non-opinion
We used to camp a lot with our#Statement-non-opinion
kids. *#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, but now we like things like the Regency Hyatt#Other
Oh, you like the motels?#Yes-No-Question
We like the motels,#Affirmative non-yes answers
yes#Yes answers
Oh, oh, well.#Uninterpretable
We have, we've gone past the camping stage.#Statement-non-opinion
We lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee for two years.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, did you?#Backchannel in question form
And we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys#Statement-non-opinion
and it was beautiful#Statement-non-opinion
and our kids loved it and everything#Statement-non-opinion
and then we moved to, uh, uh, the Dallas area#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, it's hot down here#Statement-non-opinion
and camping is not near as much fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, so, and then the kids were getting older and, and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, although our son loves to fish#Other
and, uh, and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Okay.#Other
Um, I guess what, I guess my task.#Statement-non-opinion
I usually ride my bike.#Statement-non-opinion
I have, uh, a stationary bike and, uh, a regular bike.#Statement-non-opinion
And when I can, I like to ride my regular bike outside, because it's so much nicer.#Statement-non-opinion
The stationary bike is, is so, uh,#Statement-opinion
Boring.#Collaborative Completion
boring.#Other
But I have head phones,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, plus I have it, uh, in the living room#Statement-non-opinion
so I either watch T V,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
or we have a fish tank,#Other
so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied.#Statement-non-opinion
If, I like to have the T V on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied.#Statement-non-opinion
It kind of takes the time away#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't realize, really, that's really the only time I ever watch T V, is when I'm on the bike.#Statement-non-opinion
But, and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and that just kind of gets myself, uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
But it's definitely a task.#Statement-non-opinion
You think so?#Backchannel in question form
I can't say that I really enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
I wish that I did enjoy it more,#Statement-non-opinion
but I do it because I have to not because I want to#Statement-non-opinion
I bought a stationary bike,#Statement-non-opinion
but I find that if I sit on that seat too long, it hurts.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
And I haven't figured how to get that soft,#Statement-non-opinion
and I tried even tying a pillow to it.#Statement-non-opinion
But two years ago, I joined, well, it's not quite two years, it's almost two years, I joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I love it.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
I just love it.#Statement-non-opinion
So is it just women that go there?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
It's totally women.#Statement-non-opinion
See, I think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place, uh, a, a health club.#Statement-non-opinion
Because I don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, so I have tried to just do stuff at home#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I just feel conscious about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I'm not big, you know, or anything,#Statement-non-opinion
but I still don't like other people watching me.#Statement-non-opinion
I like to be able to sweat, have my hair a mess.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh,#Other
.#Non-verbal
feel that, okay fine, if my bathing suit slips a little bit I don't have to be conscious#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of it being a little bit too low.#Other
And I, my bathing suit's just one piece,#Statement-non-opinion
so there's no big deal all the way around,#Statement-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't have to be conscious of what I'm doing or how I'm doing it.#Other
And it's, uh, oh, it's just, I don't know, it's, it's a total free relaxation.#Statement-opinion
Because, hey, you can do what you want.#Statement-opinion
You're a female,#Statement-opinion
and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing.#Statement-opinion
That's what,#Uninterpretable
And they've got such fantastic equipment in there.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
That's,#Appreciation
Oh, yeah.#Yes answers
that's great.#Other
How,#Uninterpretable
And I love the water aerobics.#Statement-non-opinion
I love the water aerobics.#Statement-non-opinion
Do they have a pool#Yes-No-Question
or what is,#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah.#Yes answers
They've got a nice one.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They have two types of water aerobics.#Statement-non-opinion
They call it aqua exercise, I guess is what they call it.#Statement-non-opinion
I've heard that that's really good for you to do.#Statement-non-opinion
It pushes you because you're pushing against the water#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in itself.#Other
So it is like double strenuous.#Statement-non-opinion
But you're not being double strenuous on your own body.#Statement-non-opinion
Because you're pushing it yourself.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So you're doing it yourself.#Statement-non-opinion
So you don't really feel like you're really working that hard, do you?#Yes-No-Question
Huh-uh.#No answers
When you're in the water?#Yes-No-Question
Huh-uh.#No answers
The only thing that I ever felt was, every time I stop and start going again, because I end up getting two jobs once in a while.#Statement-non-opinion
I end up having to quit for a while.#Statement-non-opinion
But I get blisters on my toes on the bottom because,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
I really jump a lot.#Other
Well, that's funny,#Appreciation
I never would have thought of that.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, a lot of people wear those little, uh, terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom. Especially around the pool.#Statement-non-opinion
So they just#Statement-non-opinion
Like wat-,#Yes-No-Question
wear them right into the pool.#Other
Are they water shoes?#Other
Is that,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Yes answers
They're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay,#Response Acknowledgement
okay.#Response Acknowledgement
rubber, you know, soles,#Other
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
okay.#Response Acknowledgement
so that, you know,#Other
no big deal one way or the other.#Statement-opinion
Huh, that's really funny#Appreciation
But, I never think about it until after you go there for about a week, your toes, you start getting blisters anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
So no big deal.#Statement-opinion
Huh, that's,#Uninterpretable
But it's fun.#Statement-non-opinion
So, how often do find yourself going?#Wh-Question
Um, on a, if you're doing it on a regular basis, how often do you go?#Wh-Question
I try to make it at least three times a week.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's really,#Uninterpretable
For a while I was doing it every day. Just,#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
going, uh, five days a week.#Other
I wish that I could make myself exercise every day.#Statement-non-opinion
But I do force myself to do it at least three times a week. Which I don't feel like is enough,#Statement-non-opinion
but i-, it's, it's at least something.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, it, it,#Uninterpretable
I just force, I have to force myself to do it, like I said, because to me, I really don't enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
But I know that I have to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it's just, it's, it's not a question of whether I want to, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
But,#Uninterpretable
When I was working up at, uh, The Summit,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
here in Plano, I'd leave there,#Other
and I'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's,#Uninterpretable
Oh, actually about four thirty because they start at five to six,#Other
so I was there by four thirty, every night.#Statement-non-opinion
And the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because no matter what I did or how I did it, I invariably got myself wet.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But the water only comes up basically to your, anywhere from your waist to your, oh, chest, I'd say.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I mean, it's your choice where you want to go,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
Did you ever,#Uninterpretable
I enjoyed it higher.#Other
Well, I'm sorry#Apology
That's okay.#Downplayer
Uh, did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for T I?#Yes-No-Question
Did you#Yes-No-Question
I have a,#Negative non-no answers
ever try that?#Other
I have a bad back,#Other
so I'm very limited what I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
It's like I can walk,#Statement-non-opinion
but if I walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard,#Statement-non-opinion
it will bother me.#Statement-non-opinion
Then that would,#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
it will bother me.#Agree/Accept
I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you, wouldn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Well, that, what pushed me that way though, was basically was the fact that when I went in there, is wasn't for the water aerobics.#Dispreferred answers
I went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
And, uh, she said, Hey, go for the swimming pool.#Statement-non-opinion
She says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor.#Statement-non-opinion
She says in fact you get more.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
I said, okay, because I'm not a swimmer.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like water.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not scared of it.#Statement-non-opinion
But I couldn't,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess I could swim across the pool,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm no swimmer per se.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I found that this worked really well.#Statement-non-opinion
And I came out of there#Statement-non-opinion
and I saw my stomach going down well.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I dropped, oh, I'd say almost twenty pounds.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
Just by watching what I ate.#Other
And they fix you up with a diet, which worked real good.#Statement-non-opinion
What if you're already on one?#Wh-Question
I mean,#Uninterpretable
What?#Wh-Question
A diet?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
I mean, when you go in there, they wouldn't make you do theirs. Would they?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, no,#No answers
they have nothing to do with that.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
See I joined, uh, when this one down here opened up, I joined as a V I P.#Statement-non-opinion
And the V I P gives you, uh, oh, gives you a diet, a computerized diet.#Statement-non-opinion
And they go over all your health and all your history,#Statement-non-opinion
and they show you how, everything to do, and how to do it, and the whole nine yards.#Statement-non-opinion
So it became part of the package,#Statement-non-opinion
so I went through it.#Statement-non-opinion
It worked out well.#Statement-non-opinion
But they have packages where they just offer the exercise program.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Is that what you're saying?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, yeah.#Yes answers
You can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too.#Statement-non-opinion
I see,#Response Acknowledgement
okay.#Response Acknowledgement
I just went and took the, because they were offering it as an opening benefit,#Statement-non-opinion
so it was, it's less than what you pay now for going in there,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
after all this time.#Other
So it's like when I got laid off,#Statement-non-opinion
I went back in there, and start all over again because it had been a while since I'd done it.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I get all the same treatment again.#Statement-non-opinion
So it's kind of nice.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
That's,#Uninterpretable
Like I said, I like it.#Statement-non-opinion
I like the heat.#Statement-non-opinion
I like the,#Uninterpretable
I jump out of the swimming pool,#Statement-non-opinion
and I go into the hot tub.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I love it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That would be really nice#Statement-opinion
Because I have n-, I have never,#Uninterpretable
let me reword that,#Offers, Options Commits
I think I have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore.#Statement-non-opinion
But that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's,#Uninterpretable
I knew I was pushing too far.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But usually, when I go into the hot tub before I go swimming, or when I come out, I'm totally relaxed when I go home.#Statement-non-opinion
It's no big deal.#Statement-non-opinion
So you really do enjoy your exercise then, since your,#Summarize/reformulate
It's fun.#Agree/Accept
It's fun.#Agree/Accept
Uh, I've gotten on the bike.#Statement-non-opinion
And they've got, uh, the stepping bike, where you step.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I've enjoyed that, watching how well I can walk up and down stairs.#Statement-non-opinion
That's, you know,#Uninterpretable
I wanted,#Statement-non-opinion
But most of the others to me are very dull.#Statement-opinion
I wanted to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike,#Other
but I got talked into the bike instead.#Statement-non-opinion
And I don't know,#Hedge
I really wanted a stepper.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm considering maybe even buying one of those too.#Statement-non-opinion
But I'm not sure if I'll get benefit out of both of them.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I don't know if it would really do any good having both of them.#Statement-non-opinion
Which one do you feel is better, since you use them both?#Wh-Question
Um, I get bored very easily.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit.#Statement-opinion
Like you said, you can sit and do it, and watch the T V and not even really be conscious of what you are doing.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
With the stepper, you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So you have a little, you know, little,#Uninterpretable
you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to what your gear is.#Other
Uh, I,#Uninterpretable
it would depend upon which one you want.#Statement-non-opinion
I think now that I've had the bicycle,#Statement-non-opinion
I would go to the stepper.#Statement-non-opinion
But if I were you, I would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while.#Statement-non-opinion
Because you can buy a month's membership.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
And see what you feel is best for you.#Other
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because it all depends, you know, for everyone their own what they want to do.#Statement-opinion
Because I jump on the bike here at home.#Statement-non-opinion
Mine has its, see, the handle bars go up and down,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-hum.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I can sit there and read and listen to music, like what you said,#Agree/Accept
and it has no effect on me.#Statement-non-opinion
So I mean, it's boring#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Say you did, uh, starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
and, uh, helped my wife replace some carburetors.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Some that, she had to, uh, label everything#Statement-non-opinion
She had to label everything.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah#Yes answers
because,#Uninterpretable
What was she driving?#Wh-Question
It was a Cadillac.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they, uh, well, they quit making those, the quieter jet carburetor#Statement-non-opinion
and they quit making it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They rebuilt it#Statement-non-opinion
and it never did, never did run right again.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
quad not really easy to get rebuilt just right.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on?#Wh-Question
Uh, a Maverick and also, uh, a Chrysler station wagon before that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Did you replace just the, uh, bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, the,#Uninterpretable
I'm replacing the, two or three starters on the Chrysler.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They,#Uninterpretable
The starters are kind of fragile.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the,#Uninterpretable
Especially if you need a tune-up.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They kept saying that the Chrys-, that's what Chryslers did, is they wore out starters.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, i-, i-, if they start real easy, you know, you just hit the key#Statement-non-opinion
and it starts up#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and when it's properly tuned up, that starter will last for a long time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
See, they built that starter so it would fit every V eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirty-five years.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They all take the exact same starter.#Statement-non-opinion
They'll interchange completely.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean completely.#Statement-non-opinion
One starter will fit all of them.#Statement-non-opinion
So they've got a whole lot of torque,#Statement-non-opinion
but to do that, they did it,#Statement-non-opinion
use an underdrive system,#Statement-non-opinion
but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it's got, to spin for very long,#Other
it's kind of tough on the bushings.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Usually what goes is the bushings.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You take a little time, replace the bushings, you still got a perfectly good starter.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, most places don't put, don't rebuild them with, with g-, with good enough bushings.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's, you know,#Uninterpretable
after you get rebuilt one, you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly, especially if you need a tune-up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Anyway, what are you driving now?#Wh-Question
Uh, my Chrysler van#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, it's pretty maintenance free, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, at the beginning of the year last year and drove a Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon#Statement-non-opinion
and it didn't give me any trouble at all.#Statement-non-opinion
That's good.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was a late model,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
is that Chrysler van?#Yes-No-Question
It's a eighty-seven.#Affirmative non-yes answers

one of the little mini vans?#Yes-No-Question

well, yeah,#Yes answers
it rides, rides rough,#Statement-non-opinion
it runs good.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, I kind of,#Uninterpretable
it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You have to kind of wait for it, especially when you get on the highway.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right now, without getting some of the sportier models, uh, the four cylinders aren't real peppy.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years, too.#Statement-non-opinion
You driven American cars all,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh, yeah,#Yes answers
I've driven one im-, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I drove a Volkswagen Beetle for a while, about a month.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, in a month I think I put, uh, three oil coolers on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Go-,#Uninterpretable
Uh, every time I turned around I was having trouble with it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Everything else I ever owned was American built. Uh, mostly older cars.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I've been a mechanic,#Statement-non-opinion
well, I worked, starting working my father's service station when I was about, uh, twelve.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I've been around cars a lot, but, uh, driven a lot of old Pontiacs.#Statement-non-opinion
My first three cars were, uh, seventy model Pontiacs. A G T O and a Bonneville and a station wagon.#Statement-non-opinion
I had a couple of Chryslers.#Statement-non-opinion
Had a super B for a while with a four forty in it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was a lot of fun.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Not much gas mileage, though.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
gas mileage wasn't too bad.#Statement-non-opinion
It got about seventeen.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
Well, till you got crazy with it.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, you get the four barrel all worked up#Statement-non-opinion
and suddenly it, it, it drops off fast,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
long as you didn't spin the tires too much or, or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it, it didn't do too bad on gas.#Other
Didn't have to work too hard to move the car around.#Statement-non-opinion
Now, do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, yeah,#Yes answers
yeah,#Yes answers
definitely.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the,#Uninterpretable
my last G M car was a seventy Chevy station wagon#Statement-non-opinion
and it still had the points and condenser in it.#Statement-non-opinion
When I rebuilt the engine on that, about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, uh, pulled that old points distributor out and got, an H E I distributor, electronic distributor put into it.#Statement-non-opinion

Hi.#Conventional-opening

I'm wondering what, what camping means to you.#Declarative Wh-Question
When I think of camping I think of, of bugs and sleeping bags and, and tents, uh, like along the Appalachian Trail.#Statement-non-opinion

That's sort of the same thing that, that I do.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't think of, um, trailers and campers and all this stuff.#Statement-non-opinion

Really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know I've,#Uninterpretable
Where you live now,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Say?#Signal-non-understanding
Did you camp up in Maryland,#Other
or,#Uninterpretable
No, um,#No answers
I used to live abroad,#Statement-non-opinion
and so, I, I camped a lot in, um, the Middle East#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
and I was able to camp right in ruins, which was always very exciting#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I bet.#Appreciation
and, a bit exotic#Other
.#Non-verbal
for those who love bugs,#Other
but,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
um, and then when I used to come back to the states in summer we'd often go up, um, to the lake country in New York#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with my brother's family and, and do camping there.#Other
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, my cou-, uh, husband and, and his uncle especially, uh, grew up camping together,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, they, they just love it,#Statement-non-opinion
and they're planning a trip, uh, into Canada this, I guess in about a year,#Statement-non-opinion
and they're going to spend about a week and a half camping up there,#Statement-non-opinion
And you're not going?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
this is, this is a, a man's trip#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's too bad,#Other
So they're really looking forward to that#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gee.#Appreciation
so.#Uninterpretable
I guess it makes a difference.#Statement-non-opinion
I grew up camping, being in Girl Scouts and things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
And see I was, I was never exposed to it#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
I, I feel like I'm a little bit too, uh, much of a city, city mouse to try doing it#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's too bad.#Other
I think the-, you know, there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like,#Statement-opinion
but maybe not the, yo-, you know the Canada men's trip, but some other, you know,#Statement-opinion
a nice tent on the, the shore of a lake,#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
What's the best part about it to, to you, the, the quiet, the getting away?#Wh-Question
Right,#Affirmative non-yes answers
the, the, the no telephone, the,#Statement-non-opinion
gee whiz, you go to bed when it gets dark,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and you get up when it gets light#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, I guess just, just the change,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
from the rat race.#Other
Now, do you usually, like do you usually go and there's lots of other people around,#Yes-No-Question
or is it pretty much isolated.#Or-Clause
No,#No answers
it's, uh, it's pretty isolated, um,#Statement-non-opinion
and to me, I like that, I guess, too, although there are people,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you know, it's really hard to get away#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I guess when, when we did sites in, in the Middle East, of course it was with a group, in order to make it safe#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, I mean, we'd go in different parts of the ruins, and, and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
But we didn't even have tents there,#Statement-non-opinion
we just sort of put out the sleeping roll#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, good grief.#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
That, that does sound neat,#Appreciation
but I don't think I, I've got quite enough nerve to do that.#Statement-opinion

I know my husband's gone, uh, for several days on the Appalachian Trail before,#Statement-non-opinion
and he said that you can, a lot of times you can go for, you know, a good day before you'll see or meet anybody else on the trail.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's not for the faint of heart, I don't think.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Actually I just joined, um, the Appalachian Trail Walking Club, or whatever they call it,#Statement-non-opinion

and I'm very eager to, to start, uh,#Other
I love to walk#Statement-non-opinion

Well, gee whiz,#Appreciation
I hope you get into camping some day, just slowly.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know, uh,#Other
we talk about sometimes going up to Chincoteague#Action-directive
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I,#Uninterpretable
maybe, like you said, start out slow and, and kind of get used to it, and find out that it, maybe it's not as bad as I, I fear it might be#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that, you know,#Statement-opinion
I guess one time recently we went up to Maine, and had planned to camp,#Statement-non-opinion
and you know, the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field,#Statement-non-opinion
and I said, Gee whiz, for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a, a motel#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which we did,#Other
and, so that, you know,#Uninterpretable
if the setting was right and that, it's, it's great,#Statement-non-opinion
but if it's,#Uninterpretable

Okay#Other
he did really decide to go?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Um, to Williams College in Massachusetts?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
sure#Agree/Accept
I'm familiar with it,#Statement-non-opinion
And that he was trying to decide between University of Pennsylvania and Williams,#Other
and it was a very difficult choice#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, *#Other
And he, well, he must know, is he interested in law or medicine,#Or-Clause
he must have a definite profession in mind.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No, *#Other
but that's one of the reasons why he chose Williams#Other
Oh, okay,#Response Acknowledgement
that it has solid liberal arts, *#Other
Medium size,#Statement-non-opinion
aren't they?#Tag-Question
About two thousand, *#Other

I have a husband#Statement-non-opinion
We don't have any kids yet.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay, um,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
About all I can say is I guess about picking schools, um, I guess, uh, if you don't know what you're going to do, liberal arts program is a good idea.#Statement-opinion
Well, I, I,#Uninterpretable
one of the, the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job#Statement-non-opinion
This is true,#Agree/Accept
uh, but what you can't learn, uh, on a job, is a good solid well-, well-rounded education.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
the humanities, the history, yeah,#Summarize/reformulate
That's right, you know,#Agree/Accept
the Renaissance man#Statement-non-opinion

and, uh, and if you get that you can,#Statement-opinion
and if you do well, you can, you can learn a job,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they, you know, if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school#Statement-opinion
That's exactly right.#Agree/Accept
usually a company, it will, if it's worth it's weight, will subsidize,#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
And,#Uninterpretable
So the advice we gave to them#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
was, number one, visit the colleges#Other
This, this is true,#Agree/Accept
that you're thinking about#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
describe first of all, the size school that you might be interested in#Other
And if you want to go away,#Collaborative Completion
right,#Tag-Question
do you want to go away,#Quotation
how far from home do you want to be.#Quotation
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What do you want in a college.#Quotation
Now my son is a national level competitive swimmer#Statement-non-opinion
Good.#Appreciation
so he wanted to swim in school,#Statement-non-opinion
but he did not want to be in a swim factory.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at, they'd, in Austin, Texas, University of Texas,#Summarize/reformulate
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's the University of Texas at Austin, or#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Stanford or something like that#Other
Texas Aqua-,#Repeat-phrase
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so he didn't even consider those.#Other
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well that's, I think the other thing is, too, um, I know I went to a, uh, city high school in Chicago#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say, my brother and I were,#Statement-non-opinion
and economics was the choice#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school.#Statement-opinion
He is very, very strong academically,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
so, we've just,#Uninterpretable
but, you know, he had to look to see#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what kind of environment he liked,#Other
and yet he, he did wind up having to make a choice.#Statement-non-opinion
He did apply to a large, you know, large group,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
University of Penn,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm originally from Pennsylvania.#Statement-non-opinion
Pennsyl-, University of Pennsylvania,#Statement-non-opinion
It's got about nine thousand undergraduate.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's strong,#Statement-opinion
I mean that's#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's, it's, well, it's a little bit, I don't want to use the word wilder, that's not the word I want. Um, more diverse#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
and it, but it does have the under, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school, so that the, uh, the college of arts and sciences is, you know, I guess about four thousand.#Statement-non-opinion
At Williams or Pennsylvania?#Or-Clause
At Williams,#Yes-No-Question
At Pennsylvania.#Statement-non-opinion
At Pennsylvania.#Repeat-phrase
Well how large is Williams?#Wh-Question
Williams is an undergraduate school only#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, and it's a total of two thousand.#Statement-non-opinion
Well that's not bad.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
so he knew the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which is#Statement-non-opinion
Which is a lot,#Collaborative Completion
fifteen hundred#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that he liked the environment#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but he did go on college visits,#Statement-non-opinion
and he liked,#Statement-non-opinion
That's the thing to do,#Statement-opinion
I mean, I, not having any children, my husband was an Ohio State person,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, that has something like either the first or second largest student population, like fifty thousand.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes#Agree/Accept
Combined .#Statement-non-opinion
it's large,#Statement-opinion
and they, both boys had decided no, that they did not want that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that is too much,#Statement-opinion
and I mean, I, um, I can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because I spent a year at Bennington in Vermont,#Statement-opinion
Oh, it's,#Uninterpretable
so you,#Uninterpretable
Um, and that was, this was twenty years ago#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Showing my age,#Statement-non-opinion
And did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Oh my God,#Appreciation
where are you from,#Wh-Question
well, let's not talk about that#Action-directive
No#Agree/Accept
but we've been there when whose gone up there.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, um, in that area.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean I just can't say enough about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, it's, it#Statement-non-opinion
we went#Statement-non-opinion
and he was, you know, impressed by the clean air#Statement-non-opinion
and he, he met the students at both schools#Statement-non-opinion
and he liked them.#Statement-non-opinion
Well you know, um, my husband's an engineer and a strong , a strong liberal arts background with, uh, a graduate degree in a technical field#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
will get him much further than say like a, a strong, um, business administration degree than with another M B A#Other
That's it.#Agree/Accept
on top of it.#Other
The thing is if, if a person really knows very early on#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that they want to go#Other
and they usually,#Collaborative Completion
in a technical field, than you're not, then it's probably good to go to, you know, to apply to a school#Other
Yeah,#Other
but they usually don't.#Statement-opinion
with a good technical program,#Other
but, uh, for, if you're going into,#Statement-opinion
if you know engineering is the thing if, then you've got to at least take engineering.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
but they,#Statement-non-opinion
no#Uninterpretable
but who does.#Rhetorical-Questions
I mean, I think,#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
I think all, I think the majority of people just don't know.#Other
No#Uninterpretable
he looked at criteria such as location, size of school#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh,#Other
No#Uninterpretable
he didn't apply to any school further,#Statement-non-opinion
the furthest away was Bowdoin, in Maine which is about twelve hours.#Statement-non-opinion
That's still pretty far though.#Statement-opinion
I mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that was the furthest and then Kenyon in Ohio which was about six and a half hours#Statement-non-opinion
and Williams is about seven.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's not too bad.#Appreciation
Yeah#Agree/Accept
so, well, I mean he, so it wasn't,#Uninterpretable
he, you know,#Uninterpretable
then the University of Pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train#Statement-non-opinion
and then Bucknell in mid-state Pennsylvania.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he will enjoy Williams I think and is a good academic,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and he will,#Statement-non-opinion
and if, it came down I mean, as he, he came,#Statement-non-opinion
he's been talking to them#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and he came down#Other
and one of the things that he said is, he went to Pennsylvania this weekend#Statement-non-opinion
and he had an absolutely marvelous time#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he had a great time#Statement-non-opinion
but then he said, you know, it was such a good time that I almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun.#Statement-non-opinion
That could very well be#Statement-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
and he said it almost back-,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it backfired.#Statement-non-opinion
So he's developing his, his, uh, internal instincts right now.#Other
That's good because#Statement-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
I mean I'm sure what he said was true, that, uh, you,#Other
well actually that's one of the reasons I went to ,#Statement-non-opinion
Kenyon, he we-, he made a good choice.#Statement-opinion
I went,#Statement-non-opinion
I, well I was supposed to,#Statement-non-opinion
but I spent a year in Vermont, my freshman year,#Statement-non-opinion
it was just too far away,#Statement-non-opinion
it was too different#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, the level of income of lot of the students#Other
and their attitudes was just, um, beyond my,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, in terms of drugs, et cetera, which I thought was shocking.#Other
Of course, that period too was probably difficult.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
you're right#Statement-opinion
but then I went,#Statement-non-opinion
But I did, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
my advice to him,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my hus-, was that, uh, he had to really decide what he wanted out of college.#Other
He had to look at himself.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it, he could probably slip#Statement-non-opinion
and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where, especially in a Kenyon or a Williams, where you see the professors around town all the time, you skip class in the morning and they see you,#Other
And you're going to get a little bit more input than#Statement-non-opinion
That's,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
discipline#Other
yeah.#Uninterpretable
And a swim coach is going to be right on top of you, uh, so that,#Statement-non-opinion
and he will know the professors in a small,#Statement-non-opinion
Well I don't know how to put this either in this way#Hedge
and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this#Statement-opinion
but I just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today, I think the refinement that they get#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't mean specifically or culture but just what you're saying, just a solid background#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I just don't think at that age I just don't think that young people know what they want to do.#Other
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
You know#Other
and, um,#Uninterpretable
And, um, and it's just the personal contact where if you need help#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
he had,#Uninterpretable
I told him to look to yourself.#Statement-non-opinion
Are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says I've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred#Quotation
Right .#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you're really going to look him up#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but if it's a class of fifteen#Quotation
This is very, very,#Statement-opinion
and you need help, you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and even though they may break it up into smaller groups Penn is known for having#Statement-non-opinion
They have video lectures.#Collaborative Completion
graduate assistance teaching.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Video lectures.#Repeat-phrase
They have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups.#Statement-non-opinion
This is true,#Agree/Accept
and I mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the,#Statement-opinion
did he just make the decision today?#Yes-No-Question
he made the decision, uh, I'd say, about, uh, an hour and a half ago#Statement-non-opinion
How funny#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I mean, that's so funny. I mean,#Statement-opinion
and, and, in fact, he had just an hour before that two, uh, recent graduates from Kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him#Statement-non-opinion
That's funny.#Appreciation
and, uh, I mean, and he, they were really nice,#Statement-non-opinion
and, but he said is, that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know,#Statement-non-opinion
but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better.#Statement-non-opinion
It was easy for him to rule out.#Summarize/reformulate
He knew what he didn't want#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
that's exactly,#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Now is your other,#Yes-No-Question
I mean we're talking about what you think,#Statement-non-opinion
but obviously you're experiencing it. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Did your other son, um,#Yes-No-Question
My other son is just as happy as a bed bug.#Statement-non-opinion
A clam.#Other
He,#Uninterpretable
the moment he knew, he, he decided early on that Amherst was the school.#Statement-non-opinion
He's a classical guitarist#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wonderful.#Appreciation
and he decided, he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for classical guitar,#Other
but he decided he was going to go to the, um#Statement-non-opinion
The smaller and the,#Collaborative Completion
the smaller now, and then graduate school later.#Other
And they'll do fine in their studies,#Statement-opinion
and I'm sure they'll go on to graduate school,#Statement-opinion
and, * I think this should be a slash unit, since A's next utterance follows B's longer turn#Summarize/reformulate
Well, he's really, my older boy's real happy,#Statement-non-opinion
and he's minoring in English,#Statement-non-opinion
and he had thought about economics,#Statement-non-opinion
and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't,#Statement-non-opinion
And now he's a sen-, he's a senior * should be an indep slash unit#Other
or is this early admissions?#Or-Clause
He's, um, he's going to be a junior.#Statement-non-opinion
He'll be, he's finishing his sophomore year#Statement-non-opinion
So he's,#Summarize/reformulate
so he's double majoring.#Other
So he's, yeah,#Other
well sounds like you have two talented sons.#Statement-opinion
Well, you know, see the advice we give is to not limit yourself, especially this, you know, go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two.#Statement-non-opinion
I think, and a lot of people talk about,#Statement-opinion
and it's not the economics I solely zeroed in on,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller coll-, colleges because of that,#Statement-opinion
and I think it's rather sad,#Statement-opinion
Well, one of the things we said is that they should pick the college,#Statement-non-opinion
this was our advice, too, irrespective of the cost. That somehow we would manage.#Statement-non-opinion
You are wonderful parents#Statement-opinion
Well, we place a real high priority on education in our family.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I agree,#Agree/Accept
I mean, my husband and I,#Statement-non-opinion
in fact, I'm taking my L S A T -s, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm thirty something#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, good,#Appreciation
that's wonderful.#Appreciation
and taking my L S A T -s on June tenth.#Other
Oh, that's great.#Appreciation
The point being, and your sons will learn this from you, I'm sure, that, uh, no matter what age you are, you can learn#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's exactly,#Agree/Accept
and, it sounds like they're going to, you know, they're,#Statement-opinion

There you go.#Other
What do you think invades your privacy?#Open-Question
Oh, well people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something. You know, that, that try to sell you the s-, newspaper, and, uh, wha-, carpet cleaning, and, uh, what else, roof repair#Statement-opinion
And enough,#Uninterpretable
well I think it's a waste of paper, the people that always leave, uh, junk mail and, because, um, you just end up throwing it away most of the time.#Statement-opinion
Probably eighty percent of the, the junk mail that you get is, is, um, something that you don't need.#Statement-opinion
And the same way with those calls.#Statement-opinion
What is it,#Self-talk
oh M C I, M C I really does.#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well they wo-, they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason.#Statement-non-opinion
They just keep calling back.#Statement-non-opinion
I had a carpet service call up three times,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
all within in an hour,#Other
but, I, uh, I do telemarketing,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, uh, I'm very polite#Statement-non-opinion
and I just say no thank you, and say no thank you very politely#Statement-non-opinion
and I hang up and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
don't bother me after that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me#Statement-non-opinion
and they try to get information out of me.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like the Census Bureau, United States Census Bureau.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That bothered me.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That I think is my invasion privacy because it's the government#Statement-opinion
and I don't understand what their need to know is.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy. If somebody wants personal information out of me,#Statement-non-opinion
but telephone calls I figure, they don't bother me one way or the other.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I know when I do telemarketing, um, I'm a soft person,#Statement-non-opinion
if, if someone says I am not interested I'll just say fine and back out.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I make very good sales,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm not, uh, as I said, I'm not half as pushy as these people because, I don't really care.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, if, if they're not interested fine.#Statement-non-opinion
You know that's it.#Statement-non-opinion
You can't force them to be.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No.#Statement-opinion
And I'm not pushing something down their throat that, uh, I don't think is a good item anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That I don't think I could do anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
But I feel like, oh, movie stars, or#Uninterpretable
sure, it's part of their, I guess they're portray being a movie star#Statement-opinion
they get themselves in these rag sheets#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I think they go too far.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's invasion of privacy.#Statement-opinion
because they follow them around twenty-four hours a day.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you know they do Ted Kennedy.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Of course, he's breaking the law all the time,#Statement-opinion
so it's a different story then.#Statement-opinion
You know, but, but Ed McMahon, I mean, you know, who cares about Ed McMahon.#Rhetorical-Questions
He's probably hasn't done anything interesting in the last thirty years that they've been on the air,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know.#Other
And he has a chauffeur.#Statement-non-opinion
Maybe he drinks#Statement-opinion
but he never drives a car either, you know,#Statement-opinion
it's not the same with Johnny Carson.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
I think my, seriously my classification of, of invasion of privacy is trying to get personal information,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and putting it falsely out or just bombarding me for the answers.#Other
Without your, and without your permission.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
This to me is, is my invasion of privacy.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Anytime I can honestly say no, or, throw the paper away, or,#Statement-non-opinion
but you can always write to, uh, oh I forgot the name of it and stop the junk mail.#Statement-non-opinion
That I've done. Because I don't want junk mail anyway,#Statement-non-opinion
so I c-, wrote to them when it came on the air,#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't get any of that bull,#Statement-non-opinion
tha-, it works by the way.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, good.#Appreciation
But, uh, the telephone doesn't bother me because I leave it half the time, on, uh, you know, answering service anyway,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
unless I'm home,#Other
so I figure I can turn it off one way or the other,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think that's the only bottom line thing that I dislike.#Statement-non-opinion
Because it does,#Uninterpretable
other than the U S Census, um,#Statement-non-opinion
what was it.#Self-talk
Oh the, the carpet place that called me three times,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that I felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place, and called me three times.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I mean one should be sufficient.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
But, if people don't use the telephone,#Uninterpretable
it's like I don't know when the police has their project going#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things.#Statement-non-opinion
That's the only way I know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, that's i-,#Uninterpretable
Well you have to have the telephone,#Statement-opinion
but you can't, you know,#Uninterpretable
and, and it's, sometimes it's hard to screen out all the calls that you don't want.#Statement-opinion
Well see there's no way of knowing,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's, you know, that's the problem.#Statement-opinion
Like the product I sell, uh, I sell mostly to older people which can't get it in a normal public situation.#Statement-non-opinion
The only way we'd get to them is by telephone.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, most of them like it because the company I work for is nationwide, and, uh, reputable#Statement-non-opinion
and they know that hey, we're backing it, one hundred percent.#Statement-non-opinion
Ye-, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, if we were denied the right to call people up, these people would never be able to get it.#Statement-non-opinion
Because your normal companies that offer it, do not offer it in the amounts that we do#Statement-non-opinion
and they'd never have it then, at that point.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because we offer it in a very low, you know, quantity.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So I mean, I, I don't know what to do as far as that's concerned.#Statement-non-opinion
But it is nerve racking.#Statement-opinion
I mean it is nerve racking to have the telephone,#Statement-opinion
but at least, as I said, you can always say no thank you#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
I gather you get a lot of telephone calls.#Summarize/reformulate
Sometimes,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
some days it just rings off the wall.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In other words you own your own home.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
no.#No answers
I think that's where they hit most of us.#Statement-opinion
Like I own my own home.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you just know about what time,#Statement-opinion
like some days I hate staying home because the phone rings all the time,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
I haven't been able to figure that out.#Statement-non-opinion
Something else to do about it.#Statement-non-opinion
When they call up and want to say, well tell me this, this, this, this and I'll give you a free something or other,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My answer is no thank you, I don't need it.#Other
And they say, well don't you want to know what's free,#Statement-non-opinion
and I s-, no#Statement-non-opinion
If I have to give them so much to answer the questions to get fifty rolls of film or something like that, they're taking something away from me#Statement-opinion
and I don't like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah#Agree/Accept
even if, I guess it's for coupons, they, they have a survey they run#Statement-non-opinion
and it, I guess it, one of them is supposed to be a smokers survey#Statement-non-opinion
but the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they ask, tha-, you know, they start out#Statement-non-opinion
and they ask you even, even to your income level.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that's, you know,#Statement-opinion
whether you buy a T V dinner or not, I don't think it has anything to do with,#Statement-opinion

There you go.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, Jean, the subject is jury trials#Statement-non-opinion
and should the jury recommend, uh, sentencing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now my personal opinion,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
Uh, uh, here lately it seems,#Statement-opinion
well up until a few years ago, I guess, there just too many liberals about and permitting too many, oh,#Statement-opinion
they just broaden the human rights to, to cover just about ev-, everybody, and I don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's just not right.#Statement-opinion
I think I agree with that very much.#Statement-opinion
And therefore#Statement-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
do you,#Yes-No-Question
I think juries should be able to recommend sentencing.#Other
Do you think a lot of people, when they are listening to a trial, put themselves in a position like that and say, I would never do something like that,#Yes-No-Question
and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
very possibly.#Statement-non-opinion
So many of us have led sheltered lives#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, uh, when we go into a, sit in on, a jury,#Other
I've never done it myself#Statement-non-opinion
I never have either.#Statement-non-opinion
unfortunately,#Other
I wish I could have.#Statement-non-opinion
Is there a reason why you have never,#Yes-No-Question
I've just never been called up.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
My husband works as a police man,#Statement-non-opinion
so I always assumed that that was why I was never called.#Statement-non-opinion
Well now, that's possible.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I was called up as an alternate once,#Statement-non-opinion
but I#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
never made it to the jury.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, do they have such a thing now as a six man jury?#Yes-No-Question
Not that I know of.#Negative non-no answers
Somebody told me the other day that there is, what they call a six man jury,#Statement-non-opinion
and I had never heard of such thing,#Statement-non-opinion
and I wondered if it was true.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I've never heard of it.#Statement-non-opinion
I never had either,#Statement-non-opinion
but I just wondered. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
another question was, should a criminal case, should the jury be unanimous on their decision,#Statement-non-opinion
and that I wasn't sure on either, whether it should be unanimous or not.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, well, there again, uh, I suppose it should be.#Statement-opinion
That would mean they all would have to decide#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Exactly.#Affirmative non-yes answers
one way or the other.#Other
Is it guilt or innocence.#Collaborative Completion
But then again, so many times you get one or two holdouts,#Statement-opinion
and, and#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it permits the criminal to get a retrial.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And there,#Uninterpretable
that's not too bad in this sense, because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, that's happened#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and giving them another trial might give them additional time to, uh, prove their innocence.#Other
Bring some of these things out.#Collaborative Completion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials.#Statement-opinion
Un, apparently there are.#Statement-opinion
I, I, I,#Uninterpretable
since my husband worked as a policeman, I can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have, are not guilty of something#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
some part of whatever they're accused of.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have, I still have a little bit of a problem with that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, but, I would suppose there are circumstances, you're in the wrong place at the right time, or know the wrong person at the right time.#Statement-opinion
Oh, that's it,#Appreciation
and you just might resemble somebody.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, out here in Texas we had a, a, a, great miscarriage of justice.#Statement-non-opinion
It was finally, after nine years, it was finally, uh, taken care of.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We had,#Uninterpretable
a Black man was accused simply because he resembled#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, someone who stuc-, who held up, a, Seven Eleven, I think it was.#Other
Uh-huh,#Other
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And even though he had witnesses that said that, uh, he was at work,#Statement-non-opinion
and he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not,#Statement-non-opinion
They still found him guilty?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
They found him guilty.#Affirmative non-yes answers
When people said he was at work?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, they said it w-, this, this happened during lunch time.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he could have disap-, gotten away at lunch time#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and committed the robbery.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But after nine years,#Statement-non-opinion
well as a matter of fact they made a T V show about it, after nine years, they finally came up with evidence and proved, to prove that he was innocent.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, for heaven's sake.#Appreciation
So there's nine years of that man's life gone.#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly.#Appreciation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now that just was not fair.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess that's where a lot of the problem lies,#Statement-opinion
we're, we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people, the one's that are on trial.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Statement-opinion
Unfortunately, that's what happens.#Statement-opinion
And we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to, because I bet, they still say our system is the best in the world.#Other
Well, it's not, the, uh, uh, it's not the best system,#Statement-opinion
but it's the best one in the world.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's the best one that exists, I guess.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And unfortunately, we just have to put up with a lot of things,#Statement-opinion
and they try to solve them and everything,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
the Supreme Court,#Uninterpretable
well, I'm, I'm, I'm still rancled about their decision to permit burning of the flag.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I think a lot of people are.#Statement-opinion
I think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country.#Statement-opinion
Well, it,#Uninterpretable
the, the, the First Amendment definitely says freedom of speech#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
not freedom of action.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, uh, well that just rancles me#Statement-non-opinion
no,#Uninterpretable
I swear, if I ever saw somebody to, uh, burning a flag, I'd, I'd try to kill them, I would.#Statement-non-opinion
That bad, huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I wouldn't like it,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't know if I'd go that far.#Statement-opinion
Well, I happen to be a flag freak.#Statement-non-opinion
I served, I was in the service#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was in Korea#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, well, I saw what the red in the flag represents.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I think pride in our country and our flag is so important.#Statement-opinion
It's important in so many facets of our lives.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I, I feel like if they don't, people don't like what our flag stands for, they're welcome to go some place else.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
see what they,#Uninterpretable
There's nobody holding them here.#Statement-opinion
See how they'd like it under another flag.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They'd soon be back,#Statement-opinion
I'm sure.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, Jean, we seem to be of the same opinions here.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I hope they get something out of this.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know about the judge making the decision, if that's,#Statement-opinion
do you think that's good#Yes-No-Question
Oh#Yes-No-Question
you know, like if a jury,#Other
passing sentence?#Other
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Well, uh, uh, yes,#Other
but I think the jury should be able to recommend,#Statement-opinion
Make a recommendation?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Do they sometimes make a recommendation?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, yes,#Yes answers
yes.#Yes answers
That's what I was thinking they, they sometimes do.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if that's a regular procedure or what.#Statement-non-opinion
But I know I'm always hearing that, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
well, the jury came in with a guilty verdict#Statement-non-opinion
and they recommended,#Statement-non-opinion
And they recommend.#Collaborative Completion
twenty years or something.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then the judge has the final decision#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on what does really happen. Yeah.#Other
Of course, now, the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I think that's where a lot of people think, boy they're getting put away for a long time,#Statement-opinion
but actually, their chance, course, when,#Statement-opinion
a lot of times when they come up for parole, they're denied.#Statement-opinion
It depends on#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, what they're, what they'd been guilty of, and a lot of different things, I guess.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but too many times they, they are permitted to go out on parole#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do.#Statement-opinion
And there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They just go out and repeat their crimes.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well there,#Uninterpretable
well, they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think they ought to make it two offenses.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I always thought there was, there was wrong,#Statement-opinion
it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It seemed like there, sometimes there's not a good,#Statement-opinion
the balance isn't right.#Statement-opinion
It doesn't make sense.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
very true.#Appreciation
Well, here again now, there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Race or nationality even.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, like you said, it's, it's not the best system,#Statement-opinion
but it's the best one we've got.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, let's put up with it, I guess.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Improve it if we can, if we ever get a chance.#Statement-opinion
Sure enough.#Appreciation
So.#Uninterpretable
Jean, it's been awful nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Well, it's been nice talking to you, Jack,#Conventional-closing
and I hope you have a real good day and week.#Conventional-closing
Well let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing.#Conventional-closing
I hope not.#Conventional-closing
Take care now.#Conventional-closing
You, too.#Conventional-closing

Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay.#Other
All right.#Other
What have you seen?#Open-Question
The latest movie I've seen that I thought was fantastic was DANCES WITH WOLVES.#Statement-non-opinion
That's,#Uninterpretable
I knew you were going to say that.#Statement-non-opinion
I wanted, I want#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, man.#Appreciation
to go see that.#Other
I, I just finally ended up going to see it, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and one day my husband had the kids#Statement-non-opinion
and I just went because we couldn't, we could never get to go see it together because it's so long.#Statement-non-opinion
By the time we had a babysitter for that long.#Statement-non-opinion
Gosh.#Appreciation
So I finally just went to see it.#Statement-non-opinion
And I just thought it was fantastic.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, I watched, uh, Costner on the Academy Awards.#Statement-non-opinion
I was really happy that he got,#Statement-non-opinion
I was hoping he was going to get Best Actor.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but he, he, he did pretty good on that one.#Statement-opinion
That was quite a,#Uninterpretable
the buffalo scene in that thing#Statement-opinion

was so real.#Other
It's like,#Uninterpretable
I mean it just#Statement-non-opinion

I'd, I bet.#Appreciation
blew me away.#Other

Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
DANCES. Uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.#Other
Uh, I'm, I'm afraid to go see that one.#Statement-non-opinion
That one looks so scary just,#Statement-opinion

from the previews.#Other
I thought gosh#Statement-non-opinion
Nay.#Reject
I'd probably have nightmares for the next six months#Other
It's supposed to#Statement-non-opinion
Nay.#Reject
That's what people said,#Statement-non-opinion
be good though.#Other
I know some friends who went to see it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They said it was really riveting.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you know, they, they, that's what they said about THE EXORCIST, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
No, no,#Reject
it's terrible.#Statement-opinion
You'll have nightmares, you know.#Statement-opinion
I watched last weekend.#Statement-non-opinion
Me and my roommate.#Statement-non-opinion
We, we laughed about it#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you're not a thirteen year old.#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
I saw it when I was a kid#Statement-non-opinion
and I thought, oh, man#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I'll tell,#Uninterpretable
well I guess, I, I guess it was because I'd read the book before I saw the movie.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the book, to me, was far more frightening than the movie was.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Huh. Gosh.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He's a very good writer#Statement-opinion
and he had a way of putting you in that scene, you know.#Statement-opinion
It was,#Uninterpretable
Oh, boy.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, of course, I was, I was living alone at the time#Statement-non-opinion
and it was late at night and scary and, you know#Statement-non-opinion
You start hearing noises#Statement-non-opinion
Gosh.#Appreciation
Call the crisis line.#Appreciation
you know.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I bet.#Appreciation
And there's rats in the attic, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gosh.#Appreciation
Uh, let's see.#Hold before answer/agreement
There was a couple of others that are out,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and I can't remember,#Statement-non-opinion
I saw one I thought was crummy.#Statement-non-opinion
With that new, uh, Michael J Fox movie, THE HARD WAY.#Statement-non-opinion
Where he plays a, a actor that's, uh, like th-, huh.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I didn't, I didn't even like the previews on that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I know.#Agree/Accept
It was,#Uninterpretable
well I ended up at the theater#Statement-non-opinion
and there was, didn't seem to be anything else on I wanted to see,#Statement-non-opinion
so I'll try that.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But it wasn't worth anything.#Statement-opinion
I didn't care#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
for that at all.#Other
I, I don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, the last two I saw him in, one of those BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART THREE deals#Statement-non-opinion
and that was crummy also.#Statement-opinion
I#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
didn't think that was any good#Other
so#Uninterpretable
I saw the original BACK TO THE FUTURE#Statement-non-opinion
and then I, I know,#Uninterpretable
I hardly ever go see a sequel.#Statement-non-opinion

And it's all this,#Uninterpretable
it's the story of this little cat and dog#Statement-non-opinion

It's just, uh, it's just so realistic. Everything they do.#Statement-non-opinion
You wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things.#Statement-non-opinion

And it was,#Statement-non-opinion
a real dog and cat?#Yes-No-Question
A real dog and#Other

He climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river#Statement-non-opinion
and he winds up all over creation.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know where in the world it is.#Statement-non-opinion
Somewhere in China somewhere I think that it was filmed.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, it's just really an incredible thing.#Statement-non-opinion
So-, sounds sort of like the incredible journey.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was pretty wild#Statement-non-opinion
and . Of course, the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it.#Statement-non-opinion

Well, I, I'll have to go get that one I guess.#Offers, Options Commits
It's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore.#Statement-opinion
And I'm just, I guess I'm just middle America or something.#Statement-opinion

I remember I went to see DON QUIXOTE over there when it came out.#Statement-non-opinion

You know something,#Other
I, come to think of it, I don't think I went to the movies one time.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Cause when you're touristing, you probably don't want to take the time to go see a movie.#Statement-opinion
I, uh,#Uninterpretable
where I lived. Uh, it was a little town called Newmarket.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Never sho-, any, anyway, anything that I ever wanted,#Statement-non-opinion

Probably some of them did#Statement-opinion
A lot of, a lot of people did.#Statement-non-opinion

But it would have to be a good show.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's hard to know what the good movies are anymore.#Statement-opinion

Well, my husband,#Uninterpretable
you know, how, sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing.#Statement-opinion

My husband is a hunter, fisherman, outdoorsman, Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog.#Statement-non-opinion
So we have a black Labrador.#Statement-non-opinion
Ooh.#Response Acknowledgement

but to me, he belongs up in the field, you know, in the#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Other
ranch, in the farm#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
Does he sleep in your house?#Other
Well, because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind, uh, he sleeps in the laundry room#Dispreferred answers
and then he goes out for the day.#Statement-non-opinion
But this, this is a beautiful dog#Statement-non-opinion
and he is wonderful with our little girls#Statement-non-opinion
and he is, he's, comes from a purebred line#Statement-non-opinion
and there's nothing you could say bad about him, except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you could sit in the chair and cuddle.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And this is huge.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, course, when he runs around the yard, he just digs,#Statement-non-opinion
he doesn't know that he's tearing up things,#Statement-non-opinion
but he does.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the worst part that I had with him, he's, he's three now#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
was when he was, uh, about eight months old#Other
and I did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one,#Statement-non-opinion
and I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour.#Statement-non-opinion
And I came home#Statement-non-opinion
and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my word.#Appreciation
And it was in the floor#Statement-non-opinion
and I just about lost it#Statement-non-opinion
and I called#Statement-non-opinion
and I said, come home and get your dog.#Statement-non-opinion
And so, he said, well, puppies just chew when they're nervous and I, well, I wish you had told me#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, dear.#Appreciation
you know,#Other
and it was about eight months later, he ate a piece of the linoleum.#Statement-non-opinion
He kept picking at it#Statement-non-opinion
and I didn't kn-,#Statement-non-opinion
the, the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it#Statement-non-opinion
So the last thing he did was, when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard, and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch.#Statement-non-opinion
And I told my husband,#Statement-non-opinion
I said, you know, it's either me or the dog,#Statement-non-opinion
and he looked at me like, well, you know#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Good-bye#Collaborative Completion
He loves this dog#Statement-non-opinion
and every night when he comes home from work, he hugs it and talks to him#Statement-non-opinion
and he's a good dog,#Statement-non-opinion
so it's one of those things I'm just having to get used to#Statement-non-opinion
and that's why I laughed when they called with the topic.#Statement-non-opinion
I thought, oh, boy, do I have a pet#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But, I, I grew up with cats#Statement-non-opinion

get married, you won't have the money or the time.#Other

So just, you know,#Uninterpretable
don't, don't be in any hurry.#Action-directive
I'm not, I'm not.#Agree/Accept
You really should go to Europe.#Action-directive
I went to Europe for six weeks after I graduated from college#Statement-non-opinion

I, I mean I could have had that or a down payment on a new car#Statement-non-opinion
and I took the trip.#Statement-non-opinion

And it was great?#Yes-No-Question
uh, I traveled with a group of sixteen other students.#Statement-non-opinion
Actually they, there was two other graduating seniors besides myself,#Statement-non-opinion
and we just had a ball.#Statement-non-opinion
We stayed at,#Statement-non-opinion
How long did you get to stay there?#Wh-Question
Uh, six weeks.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
It was wonderful,#Statement-non-opinion
so you should think about doing something like that.#Action-directive
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
I just had a friend that got back from Europe#Statement-non-opinion
and she was there like all winter semester.#Statement-non-opinion

About how many calls have you made on this system?#Wh-Question
Uh, I've originated only a, a few.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay,#Response Acknowledgement

But I've received quite a few.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh, I only started doing it after, uh, I started getting calls and said, oh, heck,#Statement-non-opinion
that's right,#Appreciation
I'm supposed to make a few calls.#Statement-non-opinion
So I started about a month ago#Statement-non-opinion
and I,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this is getting close to twenty here which is I think is about all, uh, our little gift book goes up to,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't really know.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Yeah,#Agree/Accept
uh, well, I'll tell you,#Statement-non-opinion
I've been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it's hard to beat any of the benefits that, or salaries either,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that we get from T I.#Other
I'm quite pleased with it.#Statement-non-opinion
Course there's a few things that, uh, I think I could do better if I was sitting up in the C E O's seat#Statement-opinion
but, uh#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think Jerry's doing a pretty good job as it goes.#Other
The one,#Uninterpretable
it's kind of like, uh,#Uninterpretable
automobile insurance,#Statement-non-opinion
the ones, uh, that I think are the highest and important to me, uh, I hope I never have to use them, really per se, although I've used medical a little bit#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, well that one certainly is high,#Statement-opinion
I, I worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening#Statement-non-opinion
so I like to reverse that trend and say I'd like to get those to strengthen, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
be better and better.#Other
Well,#Uninterpretable
Then sal-, sal-, salary continuance, I've never used that one.#Statement-non-opinion
I hope I never will,#Statement-non-opinion
but that's kind of like an insurance thing.#Statement-non-opinion
I sure like that one.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's like automobile insurance.#Statement-opinion
You never want to get in an accident#Statement-opinion
but it,#Uninterpretable
you like to have it there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, uh, like I say, I worked for several different companies#Statement-non-opinion
and there's nothing to compare with, uh, T I here.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now I really got caught up back in eighty-five,#Statement-non-opinion
I got caught up in the oil layoff uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I wasn't with G S I, but I was connected with, uh, uh, oil, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
exploration.#Other
With T I, or somebody else?#Or-Clause
No,#No answers
with T I.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I say, I wasn't connected with G S I.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, I got caught up in a layoff.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
Now, uh, course you get six months, uh, unemployment from the State#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, what T I did for us is, is, uh, I've never heard of it before. They fixed us up with an office with, uh, telephones, access to long-distance, uh, computers, a secretary to take messages for us or type, uh, letters,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for us.#Other
Uh, they had out of town newspapers#Statement-non-opinion
and then,#Uninterpretable
And outside consultants.#Collaborative Completion
Didn't they have an outside consultant, too?#Yes-No-Question
I beg your pardon.#Signal-non-understanding
Did they have an outside consultant, like a, the employ-,#Yes-No-Question
Uh, yes.#Yes answers
They did have, uh, seminars every once in a while.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, course that was not, uh, restricted just to just us.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But the most important thing was that, uh, they had made up the difference between, uh, unemployment pay and seventy-five percent of my net pay.#Statement-non-opinion
And they then,#Uninterpretable
T I paid me that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
So, uh, I was able to, uh, not just exist.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I, I lived just as comfortably as I did before I was laid off.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they seem to be do-, doing a good job of that.#Statement-opinion
I'm in facilities,#Statement-non-opinion
and our organization built, builds those facilities over in Park Central now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I guess they've been using them for six months now.#Statement-non-opinion
And I've known several engineers that got laid off#Statement-non-opinion
and they said it's like getting a Ph D almost,#Statement-non-opinion
they,#Uninterpretable
the much they learn over there, you know, after they've been laid off, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
one engineer said it was really an education.#Statement-non-opinion
He, he just learned, like you,#Statement-non-opinion
he said he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own.#Statement-non-opinion
He was very thankful for that, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, this was not a learning thing by any means.#Statement-non-opinion
It was just a, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
To have an office,#Collaborative Completion
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
an assistance trying to find another job.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, he said he learned so much#Statement-non-opinion
and how,#Uninterpretable
he thought, he thought he had a Ph D in how to get a job after he was,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
through the whole process,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for, for several months.#Other
He did eventually get a job.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, course I went through this, uh, what, about five years ago.#Statement-non-opinion
They may have improved it considerably.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah, apparently.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's very sophisticated.#Statement-opinion
And I guess it may be one of the best, uh, that anyone's doing.#Statement-opinion
Well, that's one of those little, uh, uh, little extras that you don't see in the, uh, the, the, the handbook, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You're absolutely right.#Appreciation
That's a good one.#Appreciation
It,#Uninterpretable
What do you think about pensions?#Open-Question
Anything on that or,#Uninterpretable
Well, now I have, uh, uh,#Uninterpretable
I'm getting close to retirement.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, of course I've been looking into it but, uh, since I'm only a yellow badger,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I won't be getting a whole heck of a lot from T I,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as far as retirement is concerned.#Other
What do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a four O one account.#Open-Question
I, I've been thinking about that for years, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I've never heard of such a thing.#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Statement-non-opinion
That's what I'm saying that, that pensions,#Statement-non-opinion
you see, just like you were, you're saying, you've only got, uh, so many years,#Statement-opinion
say you work for two, three companies, you take your pension with you after you're vested.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then just add the money together like you do with a four O one account, you know.#Other
Uh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, it's your account, period.#Statement-non-opinion
It doesn't matter where you go or anything.#Statement-non-opinion
That's your account to roll over.#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
that, that sounds like a hell of an idea.#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't know there was such a thing.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Reject
no#Reject
there isn't.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I'm saying that's the question.#Statement-non-opinion
What do you think could be better#Quotation
and I'm saying that pensions, say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away, which it probably will,#Statement-opinion
I think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose.#Statement-opinion
So you work for a company seven years,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
by all means.#Appreciation
Well, what would be the difference between that and social security?#Wh-Question
Uh, well social security's going to go to way, I think#Statement-opinion
and you can, or you can invest your own money.#Statement-non-opinion
You have no control over your social security.#Statement-opinion
And it's not paid for by the current,#Statement-opinion
like when,#Uninterpretable
say we retire after the year two thousand, social security's paid for by the twenty-five year olds.#Statement-opinion
You know, they may rebel and you won't have any social security. Where, if your money was in your account, I mean, you can never lose it,#Statement-opinion
it's there.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you, you know.#Statement-opinion
That's just a thought.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if they say which,#Uninterpretable
No,#Agree/Accept
I, I like the idea.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Course, that's, that's, some-, something like an I R A#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and instead of having a, a socialized pension, it just would be really money that you and your company,#Statement-opinion
maybe you had to put some money in it, too,#Statement-opinion
I don't really know.#Hedge
But I,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can see where they'd need to do something on that because the statistics are,#Other
you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own, you know.#Statement-opinion
You work for five, six, seven,#Statement-opinion
and y-, y-,#Uninterpretable
a lot of people I know, guys,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, that's what I've done.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I've bounced around.#Statement-non-opinion
About every ten years,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I change.#Other
I have, too,#Statement-non-opinion
but not, not quite that often#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, yeah,#Uninterpretable
I've only got, uh, I've got, I guess fourteen now here at T I,#Statement-non-opinion
and I hope to make twenty-five which#Statement-non-opinion
say if something happened to me,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you know, they lay me off,#Statement-non-opinion
so, you have a pension#Statement-non-opinion
but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one.#Statement-non-opinion
It would be nice if they could get them together.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do worry about medical, though.#Statement-non-opinion
Again, knock wood that, uh, I haven't used it.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess you,#Statement-opinion
I'm sorry,#Other
you really do use it throughout the year, because you get your teeth fixed and all that,#Statement-opinion
I mean, I,#Uninterpretable
but I'm not,#Uninterpretable
I'm talking about major items#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't used it for anything major.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm glad it's there, though.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, knock wood,#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't used mine for anything major. Just doctor visits#Statement-non-opinion
and, well, I, I have the, uh, the H O M A.#Statement-non-opinion
I use H O M A.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I like that, uh, a lot better than AETNA#Statement-non-opinion
I have the regular.#Statement-non-opinion
I, again, I just,#Uninterpretable
I haven't,#Uninterpretable
I can't complain about it because I haven't used it#Statement-non-opinion
and every time I needed it, it, it, it's, uh, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
fallen right in line for the, the, minor things#Other
I guess I'm the one just supporting most of the others.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, doesn't it work, you don't see, uh, uh, anything until you spend the minimum?#Yes-No-Question
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Don't you have to spend the minimum of two, three hundred?#Yes-No-Question
yeah,#Yes answers

I pay a straight five dollars for anything, a doctor visit or drugs#Statement-non-opinion
Well, drugs are okay,#Statement-non-opinion
now, I'm on that, uh, plan, where I take blood pressure medicine.#Statement-non-opinion
If you take an allergy medicine, so, anything you need a prescription for, for more than six months, you get it for, used to be six bucks,#Statement-non-opinion
they just raised it to twelve.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that one I haven't heard about.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's a typical, that's a typical one that's in there.#Statement-non-opinion
The forms are right in personnel.#Statement-non-opinion

Fact, you may be able to take care, take advantage of that.#Statement-non-opinion
It's through Baxter Labs. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion

Maybe you still can do that.#Statement-opinion
Do you, do you buy your pills one at a time?#Yes-No-Question

Well, tur-, turn in your forms.#Statement-non-opinion
Go right to personnel.#Action-directive

I don't think so.#Statement-non-opinion
You turn,#Uninterpretable
you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, they're twelve dollars,#Statement-non-opinion
again, they just were six,#Statement-non-opinion
they just raised them to twelve this year. Twelve dollars for a three months supply.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
Or whatever, whatever the, the amount is, uh.#Other
I don't want to say three months,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's a lot cheaper,#Other
allergy medicine's really, uh, expensive#Statement-non-opinion
and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive.#Statement-non-opinion
I take two.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Go right to personnel.#Action-directive

we discussed, uh, uh, medical and dental,#Statement-non-opinion
What other benefits,#Wh-Question
uh, retirement.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
salary continuation.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that's a great one,#Statement-opinion
but again a hope I never use that one.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That means you're really sick if you have to use that one.#Statement-opinion
What about vacation?#Open-Question
I'm satisfied with the vacation.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know what else, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
you say, say you get another week and,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, well, I only got fourteen years#Statement-non-opinion
so I'll get another week when I hit fifteen.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that's, that's fair,#Statement-opinion
I mean, it's reasonable.#Statement-opinion
Four weeks is a lot, I think.#Statement-opinion
I know some people who have twenty-five years and thirty and they want more#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, you know,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh.#Uninterpretable
Well, I'm, uh, I'm here,#Statement-non-opinion
I've got just eleven years#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't think I'll ever see a, a silver badge.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I won't, I won't be around that long.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, the way things go, I think I'm going to have to work till I'm seventy-five whether I quit and, uh, uh, or when I retire get a part-time job,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay, um,#Other
let's see.#Hold before answer/agreement
How do you feel about credit cards?#Open-Question
Personally, I do not care for them. Uh, although I find them a necessity in business and so forth,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I try to refrain from their use as much as possible. Um, for a number of reasons, one of which is the, you know, extreme interest rate on most of them.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The one I use, uh, of course, for mostly, only for business purposes is, uh, you know, American Express.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I'm not I'm not terribly in favor of them.#Statement-non-opinion
Not for my own personal, uh, point of view.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Plus it, uh, has, you know, from an economic point of view it has increased our debt#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
tremendously#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion, I believe#Other
Wow.#Appreciation
uh, at least that's one number for this range of numbers I have, I have heard.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you use them frequently#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Well, we, uh, me and my wife, when, when we have like extra money that we know we're going to have, and we can put it in our budget, yeah, we'll, we'll use it.#Statement-non-opinion
But like last year, I think we paid,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it was like twenty something cents interest,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
on our Visa.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think this, this year we, uh, I think we used it for Christmas,#Statement-non-opinion
and we got caught just a few days on our grace period.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, so we'll pay a little interest this year, but maybe two dollars.#Statement-non-opinion
But we don't like to do that at all.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, we, I think we feel about the same way you do real strongly.#Statement-non-opinion
We, uh, we have several credit cards, though.#Statement-non-opinion
We have a gas card, our Visa, and then, of course, the American Express,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think we have a couple of department stores.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, we use it the same way,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
I find the one I use mostly, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
aside from the American Express, I do use my Sears card.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I try, a-, as with the American Express, I try to pay it, you know, as it comes in.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh,#Uninterpretable
It's, it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill.#Statement-non-opinion
That's usually how we do it.#Statement-non-opinion
I know when I travel, or when I used to travel overseas quite a bit, what I would do on my American Express card is before I would, before I left I would mail a check to, to American Express#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, have some idea of how much was there, you know, I'd sent them, you know, several hundred dollars, or whatever#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I felt I would spend.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then use it then.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, for hotels and, and so forth.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, but I knew that it was paid#Statement-non-opinion
I knew#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I knew that I had that much#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
credit, going in.#Other
Sometimes, you know, sometimes I would go over,#Statement-non-opinion
but it wouldn't, you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big, in a big way because#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's good.#Appreciation
I've, I don't think we've gone that far#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to pay it in ad-, you know, in advance before we spend it,#Other
but, I guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it, that, like that,#Statement-opinion
Well, I found#Statement-non-opinion
that may be good.#Other
I found in, um, in traveling overseas#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, uh, often it would, uh, it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card#Other
Oh really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for hotel bills and so forth.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Plus I would, uh, when they, uh, would send the bill, they would automatically convert to the exchange rate.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, now, the only time that got to be a problem was, if the exchange rate changed drastically.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, for example, I remember on one trip to France when I started planning the trip, I think, uh, a dollar was worth nine or ten#Statement-non-opinion
francs * This looks like funny parsing to me. Shouldn't "francs" be part of previous utt, and B.64, with it's coordinating conjunction and indep clause, start a new slash unit?#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc, drastically. * See note on B.62 utt2 above#Other
And whe-, when I finally got over there, it had fallen, uh, two or three francs to the dollar.#Statement-non-opinion
So the#Uninterpretable
Wow#Appreciation
So, I got caught a little short#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
in that regard,#Other
but, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I, I was anticipating, you know, my room would cost, uh, let's say#Other
if it were, say sixty or seventy francs a night#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so, or maybe twenty dolls-,#Other
maybe it would be more than that.#Statement-non-opinion
It was more than.#Statement-non-opinion
It would average out to thirty-five or forty dollars a night#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which is a reasonable rate.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But then when I got back and I was working for the government at the time#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of course the government was several months behind in,#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
their, on its per diem for exchange rate.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So there's a little consternation, you know, in trying to get them to compensate,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for the difference in the exchange rate.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah#Agree/Accept
especially,#Uninterpretable
That was the only time I really got caught short.#Statement-non-opinion
And I,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But as I said, most, most of all I try not to use them, uh, to any, you know, lavishly, in that regard.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well tha-, that's good.#Appreciation
Well, from where are you calling?#Wh-Question

so we moved into this house in Garland,#Statement-non-opinion
it's in one of the older areas of town#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, lots of shade and squirrels and birds and#Statement-non-opinion

because it has a built on addition room, you know#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
so, um, the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, it's kind of a catch all room#Statement-non-opinion

when the kids come over to play#Other
they all go out there to play with the Barbies#Statement-non-opinion

and that kind of stuff,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
How fun.#Appreciation

Wow.#Appreciation
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it was redone before we moved in, which,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm thankful for that,#Statement-non-opinion
but the,#Uninterpretable
it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
everything is#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like, the carpet's kind of a tan and brown#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

In the, in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan, um, wallpaper#Statement-non-opinion

but#Uninterpretable
Oh, sounds pretty.#Appreciation
yeah,#Other
yeah,#Agree/Accept
we've enjoyed living here.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
It's close to my, uh, oldest daughter's school#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that makes it really handy, too#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
and she really likes her school,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Good.#Appreciation
and we are so close to shopping#Statement-non-opinion
and ...#Uninterpretable
That's an important factor there#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
how about in Coppell?#Open-Question
I've always imagined it kind of out, away from everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you know, now we have that new mall in Lewisville#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really,#Response Acknowledgement
and that's just like a mile or two from our house#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, that's nice.#Appreciation
but, when we first moved to Coppell, it's what, six years ago, we didn't even have a grocery store#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow,#Appreciation
and now we have four#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
and Coppell's not really big enough to support fo-, four grocery stores#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah#Agree/Accept
so,#Uninterpretable
but it does sound like it's definitely growing.#Summarize/reformulate
Oh, much#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
very much.#Other
In fact, it's about the size now,#Statement-non-opinion
I moved down here from Chicago, what, twenty-three years ago#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, to Lewisville#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and Coppell's now about the size that Lewisville was when, when I moved down here.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Well, when we first moved here, we moved here from Lubbock#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we almost moved to Lewisville,#Statement-non-opinion
that was#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
our second choice, yeah, behind Garland,#Other
we, at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home,#Statement-non-opinion

Uh, what do you think are the major social changes?#Open-Question
Well,#Uninterpretable
What age, uh, if you don't mind me asking.#Wh-Question
Well, I'm, I'm, uh, thirty-one.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, you're, you're young.#Statement-opinion
I'm in my#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
early fifties#Other
so you should take my word#Action-directive
you're young#Statement-opinion
Oh, I, you know, I've seen a social change,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
It's definitely,#Uninterpretable
for sure,#Uninterpretable
and it's, uh, uh, and besides that, I came from California where social change is like, you know,#Statement-opinion
Every day?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
.#Non-verbal
I mean every second.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
You know, social change in California means it takes another two or three minutes longer to get to work.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can believe that#Appreciation
And, uh, when I started work there in, it started, you know, actually going to work in eighty-two,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess that's when it was.#Statement-non-opinion
Between eighty-two and eighty-five, uh, it started out taking me an hour and fifteen minutes to get to work,#Statement-non-opinion
and then it became, you know, an hour and a half, to, you know, some days, two hours to get to work.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
That's social change.#Statement-opinion
That's, that's social change.#Repeat-phrase
.#Non-verbal
Well, what do you think is, is the major social change?#Open-Question
Oh,#Hold before answer/agreement
Right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Hold before answer/agreement
that's, that's a, that's a tricky one.#Statement-opinion
I'll let you go first.#Action-directive
Okay.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
I think probably the big major change is the role of women.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think, one, the women, uh, in the work force.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think the fact that they're becoming, uh, more, uh, how do I want to say, not necessarily politically inclined,#Statement-opinion
but they're more apt to be in political offices#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now.#Other
I think, you know, we've made great strides#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in that respect.#Other
I think that it, thirty years ago, when, uh, I was newly married, family was very, very important.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Then I think we veered where the family was not as important a unit.#Statement-opinion
And I think now it's revolving back full circle.#Statement-opinion
I think#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the family unit is becoming much more important than it was.#Other
Oh, I think it's, that's probably for two reasons.#Statement-opinion
Uh, you know, the number one is, women wanted to get out of the house.#Statement-opinion
And the second reason was, is everything costs so much more that if you don't have, you know, equal rights so that your wife gets equal pay, you can't make twice as much#Statement-opinion
That's true,#Agree/Accept
that's true#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
Well, I know that economically, uh, a wife almost has to work anymore.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And yet, I'm also noticing, uh, in the areas that I'm working and stuff, more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they didn't.#Other
I mean, you know, they wanted children,#Statement-opinion
but they still wanted to be their own person out in the work force.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I see, I am seeing women now wanting to stay home#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
more, at least until the children are up to, you know, school age.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I find that very interesting that, that#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's sort of reverting back.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I've, I've, I've found that, too, you know, where the wife is married and, and,#Statement-opinion
I mean, not, not married,#Reject
sorry,#Apology
wrong word.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Where the wife has gone to school, you know#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and gotten a degree, spent five years out in the work force, found, you know, the, the, their husband, either at college, or whatever,#Other
but still, you know, after five years, it's like, first kid#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept

Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
And, uh, so if, if there's no one else around, you know, it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something, I'll turn that on, but, uh, just for the, for the conversation factor, I think,#Statement-non-opinion
but, and then I think I enjoy when I catch it, I don't even know what night it's on, but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I love that show.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Oh, I heard they just canceled that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
I read in today's paper they just canceled that show.#Statement-non-opinion
It is a real different one.#Statement-opinion
It's, uh, it's, it's different.#Statement-opinion
I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But,#Uninterpretable
Have you seen the show, it's, it's new this year, called HOME FRONT?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers

It's, uh, I think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's set in post World War Two times#Statement-non-opinion
and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through.#Statement-non-opinion
It's really interesting.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's kind of like a s-, a nighttime soap opera type thing.#Statement-opinion

Is that on, what chan-, what station?#Wh-Question

I did watch soap operas,#Statement-non-opinion
but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Except when I'm home sick,#Other
and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?#Statement-non-opinion
That's right#Agree/Accept
They're stupid#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But not anymore.#Statement-non-opinion
That can happen.#Statement-opinion
So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?#Open-Question

Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I think,#Statement-opinion
I also, course, like to catch the news during the evening hours#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, it's a little tough because that's when I'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time.#Statement-non-opinion

So, usually I don't get a whole lot of news watching in.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we watch C N N in morning while we're getting ready#Statement-non-opinion

I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
sometimes they come on and, and say.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's right.#Agree/Accept
Well, today on C N N they were talking about something like this about, uh, learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing, helping them get a data base for words.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because we, uh, we've talked to a lot of people from Texas, it seems,#Statement-non-opinion

Um, I think, uh, that's pleasurable for all of us, if we choose the right restaurant#Statement-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, what are your thoughts on dining out?#Wh-Question
Well, I, I really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else.#Statement-non-opinion
Not for the price?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, a little bit#Affirmative non-yes answers
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
for the price,#Other

Why?#Wh-Question
No,#No answers
because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever.#Statement-opinion
They use the, they use the insides of the animals, heart and liver#Statement-opinion

Health food, uh, restaurants that,#Statement-non-opinion

I'm not sure what you're talking about.#Statement-non-opinion
well, like, um, well, I can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between.#Other
But they ought, there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious. You know, as far as their cholesterol levels and their, their fat content and, you know, the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product#Statement-non-opinion
and they list them.#Statement-non-opinion
Now there's one restaurant that does that#Statement-non-opinion
and it's called Rodolfo's#Statement-non-opinion
over on Preston Road and Royal Lane I believe.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they r-, have very good food over there.#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I really don't have anything to compare it to.#Other
They do list, um, you know, list the fat,#Statement-non-opinion
It would be good I think,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
uh, I don't know how expensive they are.#Declarative Wh-Question
It sounds like that it would probably,#Statement-opinion

For one person?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers

It's a special occasion,#Other

And now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime.#Statement-opinion

I like the,#Statement-non-opinion

Well, they have lunch specials that#Uninterpretable
you can't, you can't beat that price, uh, if you went to a cafeteria.#Statement-opinion

Probably that's true.#Agree/Accept
But I know a lot of their, a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things,#Statement-opinion
Well, I had the,#Statement-non-opinion

I had a broiled chicken breast#Other
and it was excellent.#Statement-non-opinion
It was a marinated, broiled chicken breast#Statement-non-opinion
and it was exce-,#Statement-non-opinion
Now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?#Wh-Question
Oh, it was,#Statement-non-opinion
That's one of my husband's pet peeves.#Statement-non-opinion
He doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I've never had catfish either in a restaurant because I'm from the north#Statement-non-opinion
and that was a no no.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
And I haven't gotten over that from the north.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, catfish is wonderful.#Statement-opinion
I know they say that,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that is,#Other
but I'm,#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they've got all these caution signs now on fish#Other
and so I kind of stay a-,#Statement-non-opinion
Why?#Wh-Question
Because of all the pollution in the lakes and the,#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
everywhere. I mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish.#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I-, and especially, uh, in Wisconsin and Michigan they say, no, buying of our fish.#Statement-non-opinion
That's too bad,#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
because I'm probably not going to stop eating it#Other
Well, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So yo-, I am,#Uninterpretable
and the, the best brand of chicken to buy is the, uh, Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote , uh, unnatural growth in their products.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I mean, we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy.#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
So I'm, I, you know, I,#Uninterpretable
Oh, on one hand I see that#Statement-non-opinion
and on the other hand, uh, my older sister#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
remembers when, uh, at one point they were taking radioactive wastes#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and storing them in tin barrels which i-, I guess,#Other
Corrode.#Collaborative Completion
had a half-life of, oh, five years if they sit empty on dry land.#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then they take these things that will rust#Statement-non-opinion
and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then they wouldn't think.#Statement-non-opinion
They were floating around#Statement-non-opinion
so they shot holes in them to sink them.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, dear.#Appreciation
And this is before I was born.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
So, I mean we're taking thirty years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this happened,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and who's, you know, the tuna is radioactive#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
Everything we eat.#Statement-opinion
to a certain extent.#Other
Everything,#Statement-opinion
You can't get away from it#Statement-opinion
so I think,#Uninterpretable
everything we eat should have a label on it#Other
To some point,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Repeat-phrase
you know. So there's, you know, there's some things I think we can av-, we, you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like, you know,#Statement-opinion
this is not in my control.#Statement-opinion
Well, you know,#Uninterpretable
So I'm either going to be, I'm either going to starve to death#Statement-opinion
or I'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as I possibly can, you know.#Statement-opinion
Well, Becky, you know, even if you lived off your own land, that you would have to put caution signs,#Statement-opinion

You think about AIDS research?#Other
Well, AIDS is a nasty, terrible disease,#Statement-opinion
and you die from it.#Statement-non-opinion
So I think that, uh, they need to look into it#Statement-opinion
and it's kind of like cancer.#Statement-opinion
I don't, you know,#Hedge
how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer.#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it'll probably be as difficult.#Statement-opinion
Uh, how about yourself.#Open-Question
Um, well, I'm certainly in favor of AIDS research,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does.#Statement-opinion
I think that#Statement-opinion
because, besides the fact that it's a deadly disease, that it's a contagious disease, so that it's, um,#Statement-non-opinion
although it is not killing that many people now, it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they say a million people are infected#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with the H I V virus,#Other
and, uh, yeah,#Uninterpretable

Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah#Yes answers

Whose figure is that?#Wh-Question
I don't know.#Statement-non-opinion
I've just heard it on the radio.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Sometimes you hear things that, on the radio that, you know, could be true or couldn't be.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, do you feel like this is,#Yes-No-Question
I, I guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you think they should spend more?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, I, I think they should, actually, although prob-, perhaps not a, an incredible amount more than what they're doing,#Negative non-no answers
and I don't necessarily think that they should, uh, fund AIDS research and, in the process, neglect cancer research or whatever.#Statement-opinion
I think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general.#Statement-opinion
What do you think, Doug, of Mister Johnson?#Wh-Question
Um#Statement-non-opinion
Magic?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
well, I, well, I am sorry that he has the virus.#Other
I, um, I don't know,#Hedge
I don't, I think it's very strange that the media hasn't, um, questioned him more strongly to, about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that, as they probably would for a lot of other people.#Statement-opinion
Do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of other, a bunch of the media?#Yes-No-Question
Um, well, not, not really, though I mean, I think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position,#Negative non-no answers
but I don't think it's anything exceptional that he's doing.#Statement-opinion
It's what many people have done already, who were just less famous.#Statement-opinion
You know, I took advantage of the opportunity when, you know, he came out.#Statement-non-opinion
I talked to my kids about it, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's something that I hadn't, hadn't done before.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh.#Uninterpretable
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
I'm glad that Mister Johnson's changed his tune on, uh, safe sex to abstinence,#Statement-non-opinion
or#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was glad he did that, for young kids, because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, let's see.#Hold before answer/agreement
What are some of the other questions.#Wh-Question
Uh, you don't, uh,#Uninterpretable
let's see.#Hold before answer/agreement
I don't have any friends that have the disease.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess you might, might not.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Um, yeah,#Yes answers
I do.#Statement-non-opinion
My cousin, does, for instance.#Statement-non-opinion
Is it pretty#Yes-No-Question
And, um,#Uninterpretable
nasty?#Other
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah#Yes answers
it is.#Statement-non-opinion
He's actually, um,#Statement-non-opinion
he had AIDS related complex for a while,#Statement-non-opinion
and he is now in full-blown AIDS, really not doing very well, and has a brain tumor or some-, that sort of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it sounds awful.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's, it's a very nasty thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly#Yes-No-Question
and,#Uninterpretable
Um, yeah,#Yes answers
that's, that's basically it, that, um, the immune system can at first slow down,#Statement-non-opinion
and the white blood cell count goes down,#Statement-non-opinion
which is, that's AIDS Related Complex,#Statement-non-opinion
but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom, that's AIDS#Statement-non-opinion
And,#Uninterpretable
and in that case, you know, people are prone to getting any kind of, you know, weird cancer that only animals got before#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that sort of thing,#Statement-non-opinion

Gun control seems to be a rather, uh, timely topic, with all that's going on legislation wise.#Statement-opinion
Yes#Agree/Accept
And, uh, interesting scale that they assigned it, uh, the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free#Statement-non-opinion
I'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle, I guess.#Statement-opinion
don't mind regulating guns#Statement-opinion
and I would certainly call for a ban on certain types.#Statement-opinion
Now wisdom as to which types, that's going to be a debate forever, I would assume.#Statement-opinion
Uh, the method controlling it, well that's all into how much money you want to put into controls.#Statement-opinion
Uh, one point that was made in the House hearings#Statement-non-opinion
or#Uninterpretable
the representative stood up and said, you know, we can check a guy's credit card instantly,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, we don't want to check his background,#Quotation
and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh,#Uninterpretable
but there still, technology exists check it if they want.#Statement-non-opinion
So, kind of a,#Uninterpretable
I guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that.#Statement-opinion
And then you've got the group of people that decide that no particular reason to have them at all#Statement-non-opinion
and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it#Statement-opinion
and I guess I would fall more in realm that I like the sport issue of it,#Statement-opinion
but could give it up without too much trouble,#Statement-non-opinion
not the world's most pleasurable thing#Statement-opinion
and it costs a bit to do it,#Statement-opinion
Yes#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, finding ranges and things like that.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I have shot a variety of guns for a number of years,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's just not like golf or whatever.#Statement-opinion
I mean there are other things that you could go do.#Statement-opinion
So, uh, don't see joy of shooting that much of a driving factor.#Statement-opinion
I think that society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't even keep the gun in our house,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I don't have that problem,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
it's a hard, hard topic, I guess.#Statement-opinion
A lot of people have a hard issue, a lot of hard feelings about it.#Statement-opinion
They do,#Agree/Accept
and can get them on either side#Statement-non-opinion
and just like you say,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, well I'd have to place myself, uh, probably seven or eight#Statement-opinion
because,#Uninterpretable
or not,#Reject
onto no control,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sorry, excuse me, that,#Apology
uh, two or three.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was going the wrong direction.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, because of, we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Appreciation
because they had a gun in the house#Other
and the father kept the bullets in a separate place,#Statement-non-opinion
but the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, he knew where places were, loaded the gun#Statement-non-opinion
and they were playing cowboys and Indians#Statement-non-opinion
and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes.#Statement-non-opinion
Boy.#Other
So, uh,#Uninterpretable
I mean it,#Statement-non-opinion
it destroyed two families#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, in just that instant#Other
and, and say that they need it for protection, uh,#Statement-opinion
having worked at one time in Baltimore,#Statement-non-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable
I don't know if you're in the big city,#Statement-non-opinion
Dallas.#Statement-non-opinion
are you,#Yes-No-Question
Dallas?#Signal-non-understanding
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
That's a big city#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, then you know that, uh, uh,#Uninterpretable
if you live anywhere real close that, uh,#Statement-opinion
the safety is, uh,#Uninterpretable
some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and, you know.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, uh, we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I, uh,#Uninterpretable
once, uh, uh, knew a fellow that had, had been a policeman#Statement-non-opinion
and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber, he's going to assume that you know how to use it well,#Statement-non-opinion
and he's going to, you know, try to shoot first.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, so, you know, if he's got one.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and if not,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, then usually they, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you know#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Other
he said that was better not to have,#Statement-non-opinion
especially myself, now I'm a widow,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
when my handicapped son not at home, I'm by myself,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, there's,#Uninterpretable
I still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's really uh, playing Russian Roulette if you do#Statement-non-opinion
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
About the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that person was coming your way.#Statement-opinion
Once you're surprised, it's too late.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
And, and the rare,#Uninterpretable
That's right.#Agree/Accept
circum-,#Other
you know, the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and had time to do anything about it.#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
And, I don't have that problem,#Statement-non-opinion
as I don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one.#Statement-non-opinion
uh, N R As, uh, claim that the, uh, the constitutional, the right to bear arms and that whole statement, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it's hard to know the original intent,#Statement-opinion
but don't see it as that, that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that, uh, yeah, it's the right to, to arm a militia as opposed to just the general public.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And earn a right,#Statement-opinion
not just a privilege as it were if you're going to serve in the militia,#Statement-opinion
then you have a right to have that arm,#Statement-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
That's right.#Agree/Accept
you know, there's all sorts of arguments there#Statement-non-opinion
I know#Agree/Accept
but, I don't even want to worry about what the original intent was,#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they didn't have this problem back then#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
That,#Agree/Accept
So, we change our rights with our social status.#Statement-opinion
That's, that's right,#Other
that's right.#Agree/Accept
They're man given rights#Statement-non-opinion
and they can be taken away by a man,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, the people that hide behind that, I don't worry about.#Statement-non-opinion
They can go live in another country if they want.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's how I feel, too.#Statement-non-opinion
I know, well,#Statement-non-opinion
here where I work, uh, we have gun club.#Statement-non-opinion
And, of course, those people are very avid.#Statement-non-opinion
They, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they say there should be no ban,#Other
that it's not,#Uninterpretable
but I can't see why any, uh, o-, on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you know, when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide,#Statement-opinion
but there are a few guns that, uh, just are not, uh, sport,#Statement-opinion
or, I mean,#Uninterpretable
I don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, think they should have at least some control over, over those things.#Statement-opinion
Uh, and when you were speaking about how they can check up, you know, on credit cards,#Statement-non-opinion
well, understand about the privacy act and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not.#Wh-Question
That, to me, would not be an unreasonable thing.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And if they do,#Statement-non-opinion
course the argument with the people in the gun club, uh, is that, uh, well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so, it's not going to be that they're buying them.#Statement-non-opinion
Course, some of them do.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it, it is a hard question#Statement-opinion
Tends to, tends to strap only the legitimate people.#Summarize/reformulate
Most regulation does#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
and, most,#Uninterpretable
it's very difficult to, uh, legislate, uh, crooks or#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
so it's,#Uninterpretable
well, this may be a never ending topic.#Statement-opinion
I got a couple of calls waiting on me,#Statement-non-opinion
so I'd better let you go.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
well thanks for talking.#Conventional-closing
Okay, bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye now.#Conventional-closing

Okay,#Other
well, I don-,#Uninterpretable
I mean, what thoughts do you have on the subject?#Open-Question
Uh, you know, we even lived there for a, a while when my husband was in the Navy.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you did?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
In fact the first year we were married, he was already over there, had been there two years when we got married#Statement-non-opinion
and so our,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we had a one year honeymoon.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh,#Statement-opinion
That's wonderful.#Appreciation
Uh, it was very nice, um.#Other
Well do you have, you probably have a different sense than I have.#Statement-opinion
I went to an inner city high school in Chicago.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, and that's not where I am originally from.#Statement-non-opinion
It was a divorce situation of my parents.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was a, a cultural shock to me.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sure.#Appreciation
Uh, in terms of what I went through.#Other
The high school is now called, in fact, it was called Tulley High School#Statement-non-opinion
and now it's called Roberto Clemente#Statement-non-opinion
Roberto died while we were down there as a matter of fact.#Statement-non-opinion
That, yeah, that's exactly, about twenty years now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, what was it like living there,#Open-Question
I mean did you find that people appreciated having the privilege of being,#Yes-No-Question
It's like anywhere else.#Statement-opinion
People are individuals#Statement-opinion
and I find it really difficult an, and, frustrated trying to make stereotypes, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
I agree with that,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
And, uh, i-, I can understand the, the frustration you must have gone through, uh, going to the, the school, uh.#Statement-non-opinion
We-, I didn't mean that in a totally negative sense.#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
no,#Agree/Accept
it's just,#Uninterpretable
if, if it's not part of your culture,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you come upon something that you're totally unprepared for,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, the firs-,#Other
I had gone to a very, uh, uh, um, conservative, uh, college#Statement-non-opinion
and when I started teaching school it was in an inner city situation,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
although it was not Puerto Rican, it was, uh, a Mexican American and black students.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They weren't like any of the Mexican American or black people I had gone to school with#Statement-non-opinion
so it was,#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you had ever been.#Summarize/reformulate
it was very, very, different.#Other
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, I'll give you and idea that I had, um,#Statement-non-opinion
and I would say, I would say the ones, the majority appreciated what they were having in this country.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, but a lot of the ones that didn't e-, even in the minority, not in the sense of the cultural world, word, they made it worse for the other kids in school.#Statement-non-opinion
And, you know, Chicago, back then, even had bilingual classes.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
and I mean, I had geometry,#Statement-non-opinion
the teacher was from Cypress Greece#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
it was, Spanish and English,#Other
so if you can imagine how I even go-,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my.#Appreciation
And, I mean, and I guess I look at is as an enlightening sense.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, but I think basically, I think they should leave things the way they are right now,#Statement-opinion
I mean, I don't really have enough in terms of an argument, pro or con in terms of making any type of change.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not, so much against their making, uh, it a state.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I would want a very, very, very clear majority,#Statement-non-opinion
because if the minority can be so, vociferous, whether you're talking this group, or, or,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
any other group that, that has a stake in something.#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
that's exactly.#Agree/Accept
And they can make, as you said, uh, so well, the, a, a few can make it so miserable for everybody else.#Statement-opinion
And that's exactly,#Agree/Accept
I mean, I can remember instances that, uh, wasn't as, uh, you know, bad,#Statement-non-opinion
Lord, I don't know how it would be today.#Hedge
Well I know what it looks like,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I've been back up for a reunion.#Statement-non-opinion
That, that my give you a clue.#Statement-opinion
It does,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Agree/Accept
um, but its', but it's an experience I wouldn't change,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean my husband, um, grew up in, um, a majority, uh, WASP, southern Ohio, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that, um,#Uninterpretable
when he saw where I, you know, saw my later teenage years, he was just, I hate to say aghast, because that sounds so trite,#Statement-non-opinion
but he was.#Statement-non-opinion
And yet, how did I turn out the way I did turn out.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right. *#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I said that's really irrelevant.#Statement-non-opinion
What you find is that, um, if you can talk to like,#Statement-opinion
I mean, I learned a lot about the, um, Island of Puerto Rico from talking to these kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I'm sure,#Other
You know, and you lived there#Statement-non-opinion
so you know that parts of it are beautiful and parts of it are squalor.#Statement-opinion
Same as, as any other part of the world,#Statement-opinion
Like here, yeah,#Agree/Accept
really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's the same.#Other
I, I don't, I don't think it's really to their best interests,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to, uh, uh, attain statehood as it is right now,#Other
they have the best of both worlds.#Statement-opinion
They have, uh, representation,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they don't have to pay all the taxes and so forth that we do.#Statement-non-opinion
This is true.#Agree/Accept
Uh, being that it's an island economy, um,#Statement-non-opinion
everything is imported#Statement-non-opinion
and yes, the cost of living is super high,#Statement-opinion
but, but they're protected in so many ways without having to, to pay for the rights and privileges.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know what you're saying,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
th-,#Uninterpretable
So, so you know, I, I would just as soon,#Statement-non-opinion
an, an, and, if, if they voted to, for independence, I would back them a hundred percent.#Statement-non-opinion
And that's,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's, because, I, I guess, because I'm not into territorialism or whatever, that we have been in the past.#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
right,#Agree/Accept
I probably would say the something if I knew that inte-, intellectually that it was good#Statement-opinion
and emotionally that the people there wanted it.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, it's just, um,#Uninterpretable
I mean, r-, right now they have the privilege of voting with the United States, don't they.#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah.#Yes answers
They count, yeah, as a principle,#Statement-non-opinion
that's what I thought.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, but I've also been down there.#Statement-non-opinion
We traveled a lot to the B V I, the British Virgin Islands.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So you always pass through San Juan in going to places like or .#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, um,#Uninterpretable
and it's just, it's, I think what they do need is an infusion of some of the United States, um, privileges, some of our resources. The educational, the teachers, the, um,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
academic opportunity, you know,#Other
I don't think we do en-, do enough of a resource transfer, if there is such a thing.#Statement-opinion
Part of that though has been, I think, uh, selected by, by them,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in that, that whereas they want the benefits of some of, of what the continentals can offer,#Other
they,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they want to maintain that, um, culture of theirs,#Other
Uh,#Uninterpretable
which, which I understand.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and so often when you, when you bring in the advantages, the resources and so forth, there, there is a trade.#Statement-opinion
They'll lose their ethnicity as they say,#Summarize/reformulate
yeah.#Uninterpretable
That's,#Uninterpretable
Most of the people who that i-, that I know about who really, uh, would, fa-, favor statehood,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
have pretty much assimilated into the, the continental states already.#Other
See,#Uninterpretable
Or they have family here and this way they can go back and forth#Statement-non-opinion
and, and it's not that much of a strain,#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, they're kind of lackadaisical about it.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
At least at the present time.#Other
That's the way, the way the pendulum seems to be swinging, right now.#Statement-opinion
It sounds like you probably know qui-,#Statement-opinion
I mean to this day are you still in touch with any native Puerto Ricans that you have made friends with,#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
No,#No answers
we really didn't keep that up,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just,#Uninterpretable
No,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's natural,#Statement-opinion
I just thought I'd ask that because I wondered what you thought they might think.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
Because I really don't have any, um, personal or professional or familial ties down there.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know, the peop-, the, the, the, that's just children, but the, the people that I went to high school with, um, I think the majority are in that, the, probably the generation, yours and mine#Statement-opinion
and the one right after us, that, um, their parents did not want to acclimate to the United States.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, in terms of retaining, um,#Other
and my background's European heritage#Statement-non-opinion
and their background it would be, you know, the, we-, I guess I would say the la-, Latin or Latino heritage.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Not speaking in English, um, having the children drive them everywhere, and these were not old people.#Statement-non-opinion
These were like in their early forties.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
Um, and I always, that always bothered me#Statement-non-opinion
and then there were some children that I noticed as soon as all the kids were out of high school, I mean they went back to Puerto Rico to live.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, they had made enough money here.#Statement-non-opinion
And so th-,#Uninterpretable
But on the other hand, I guess it's all about choice#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in everything.#Other
Um, was it,#Yes-No-Question
I mean how were they toward,#Open-Question
that's interesting the, the way, term you used continentals, which I'm sure is the proper term.#Statement-opinion
How were they toward the United States in terms of just general, relationships,#Open-Question
I mean, were they glad?#Yes-No-Question
There really were three major, um, camps,#Hold before answer/agreement
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and there were those who, who, uh, were very friendly, very open, any, anything we can do for you, uh, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
either way, you know, was great.#Statement-opinion
And then there were those at the other end of the spectrum and those that, ho hum, whatever,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
and, and, uh, it, it was interesting,#Statement-opinion
the whole time we were there it was very, very political.#Statement-non-opinion
There was always some, on Sunday afternoons, uh, going through the, all the little urbanizations, the little neighborhoods with, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
blow horns, oh,#Other
I can't think of the term#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know.#Uninterpretable
I know what you're talking about#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
And with banners and, and a parade of vehicles with their, with their colors of the,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of a particular party.#Other
So they were very, very, um, passionate,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
about their beliefs#Other
but it, it, it kind of broke down that you couldn't really see,#Statement-opinion
I couldn't see that there was a clear majority that, that stayed.#Statement-non-opinion
It seemed to shift as, as,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't, I don't predict,#Statement-non-opinion
what you're describing is actually a conflict, very dif-,#Statement-opinion
hello, uh,#Yes-No-Question
you know what,#Other
I've got to go, because that's my cordless battery going.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, oh, I see,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

the first one I got.#Statement-non-opinion
He jumped off the balcony actually, of a second story apartment.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh no.#Appreciation
And he'd never been outside, like, you know, by himself outside.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it started raining#Statement-non-opinion
and I was hysterical.#Statement-non-opinion
I was, I was,#Uninterpretable
I mean, you would have thought a child had died.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I called everyone I knew,#Statement-non-opinion
I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I understand.#Appreciation
And they laughed at me,#Statement-non-opinion
they thought that was so hysterical.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh no,#Appreciation
I understand,#Appreciation
we, uh, we've gone through the same things with ours,#Statement-non-opinion
we've had, you know, they've been ill,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean I take off work,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to take care of my cats, you know,#Other
my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And then we had a baby#Statement-non-opinion
and it's like, all right who comes first the cat or the baby.#Statement-non-opinion
The cat was here first#Summarize/reformulate
so I know,#Statement-non-opinion
it's hard.#Statement-opinion
And, and then when we go to sleep at night, you know, it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how funny.#Appreciation
It's like all right, whose corners is this one.#Statement-non-opinion
That's sweet,#Appreciation
I have the two,#Statement-non-opinion
the other two cats I have are outdoor cats.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they didn't used to be actually,#Statement-non-opinion
but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside,#Statement-non-opinion
so I put them outside once I got a house#Statement-non-opinion
and they're doing great out there,#Statement-non-opinion
they love it.#Statement-non-opinion
But the other one, the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Other than that he gets scared to death.#Statement-non-opinion
If you shut that door he goes into hiding.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh no.#Appreciation
I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
that's it#Statement-opinion
And Lord knows what happened to him.#Statement-non-opinion
He's probably been through all kinds of nightmares.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
traumatized for life here.#Summarize/reformulate
Probably.#Maybe/Accept-part
Oh yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we've,#Uninterpretable
all four of ours are house cats.#Statement-non-opinion
Are they.#Backchannel in question form
We started out with two, with two outdoor cats#Statement-non-opinion
but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh no.#Appreciation
Oh well he lived through it,#Statement-non-opinion
oh, I couldn't believe it.#Statement-non-opinion
We went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh my gosh.#Appreciation
The, the cat almost died,#Statement-non-opinion
and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat,#Statement-non-opinion
oh he loves life now.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I imagine.#Appreciation
And he's like oh, thank you so much.#Statement-non-opinion
I wonder how many of his lives he missed, when that happened.#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Agree/Accept
we wondered about that.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, oh that was a traumatic experience for us too.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I can imagine,#Appreciation
what did he shoot him with.#Wh-Question
Uh, well, uh, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun#Statement-non-opinion
and then he started chasing him with a bull whip.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh my gosh.#Appreciation
People are crazy.#Statement-opinion
Oh yes,#Agree/Accept
absolutely nuts.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, luckily enough, you know, we found the cat in time and, uh, rushed him to the vet#Statement-non-opinion
and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Oh Lord.#Appreciation
tod-,#Other
I mean he started off as a stray#Statement-non-opinion
and then we did all this for him#Statement-non-opinion
Oh man.#Appreciation
But oh, he's been a wonderful cat.#Statement-non-opinion
I imagine.#Appreciation
They usually are after something like that happens to them.#Statement-opinion
It seems to mellow them or something.#Statement-opinion
Oh yes.#Agree/Accept
But, uh, we wouldn't ha-, we wouldn't have them,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I don't see us without pets, without cats.#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
There's just, uh, there's this, they just fill this void.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah,#Agree/Accept
I ke-, I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I don't, I can't take care of them as well because they're outside,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
and I feel like they need a big home, a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things.#Statement-non-opinion
But I can't give them up.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh no.#Agree/Accept
I just, I go hysterical when they don't come home.#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Agree/Accept
and you worry about, oh, who's taking care of them.#Summarize/reformulate
Oh, oh yeah,#Agree/Accept
and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you go crazy thinking it might be yours.#Statement-non-opinion

It took me about two weeks to realize, that was real lonely.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

So I found this one#Statement-non-opinion

Oh uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I thought well that's interesting,#Statement-non-opinion

And he was the only one left#Statement-non-opinion
and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he was the last one she carried across, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
the whole big sad story.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So of course, I had to take him.#Statement-non-opinion
I felt so sorry for him after that.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he is, uh, you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh no.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he,#Uninterpretable
I asked the vet why he did that#Statement-non-opinion
and he said he was probably weaned too young, which he was, because his mom was killed,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But he is the lovingest cat.#Statement-non-opinion
Everybody, people who don't even like cats, like him.#Statement-non-opinion

He never meows,#Statement-non-opinion
he, he doesn't have any front claws,#Statement-non-opinion
I had him declawed,#Statement-non-opinion

Oh that's good.#Appreciation
Oh we just, uh, just love them.#Statement-non-opinion
They, uh, you know, get to feeling so lovey and dovey#Statement-non-opinion

I had a dog when I lived at home#Other

And, but oh, they're so much fun to watch them play.#Statement-opinion
Oh they are.#Agree/Accept
I love it,#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit.#Statement-non-opinion
It's like this train.#Statement-non-opinion
A train of cats running around.#Summarize/reformulate
I mean it sounds like a train.#Statement-non-opinion
We have wooden floors#Statement-non-opinion

but no, uh, no snow.#Negative non-no answers
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The snows all melted off mount, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I talked to a woman who lived up in the hills, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
mountains in, uh, Utah, I guess this last weekend#Other
and she had, uh, quite a bit of snow on the ground her way.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess there's different parts of the state of Utah that, that, does have some,#Statement-opinion
but not,#Uninterpretable
usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts#Statement-non-opinion
and they're down between thirty-eight and, uh, forty inches.#Statement-non-opinion
Um#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
At this time of the year,#Statement-non-opinion
and we've been in a drought for the last five years#Statement-non-opinion
and this is the sixth year#Statement-non-opinion
and it's getting quite serious, as far as water next summer.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, the weather, uh, here, is always a topic of conversation in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather,#Statement-non-opinion
but we have our share of cold weather as well.#Statement-non-opinion
The, uh, temperature this morning was right at freezing.#Statement-non-opinion
It didn't stay there,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was right at,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's, that's different, isn't it?#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We usually have some of our coldest weather toward the, uh, end of January,#Statement-non-opinion
but this year it wasn't bad at all.#Statement-opinion
I guess that's because we had so much rain.#Statement-opinion
I know my son was telling me about the rain down there.#Statement-non-opinion
He said it was just,#Statement-non-opinion
and we read in the newspaper, southern part of Texas I guess#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
flooded out,#Other
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, my, uh, my sister lives in Houston#Statement-non-opinion
and they, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
the river there was, uh, in the flooding stage near where her son lives,#Other

Oh, boy.#Appreciation
They have a, uh, lake cabin#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, their dock was completely under water#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my gosh.#Appreciation
on the lake.#Other
So we really had a lot of rain.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah my son in Plano, he lives fairly close to,#Statement-non-opinion
there's quite a wash that goes down, uh, through Plano#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, there's walking trails on both sides, a walking path,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, when I've gone down to visit him I've gone on that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, that was clear full and up to, up to some of the streets, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
It just k-,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we had a lot of flash floods in the area.#Statement-non-opinion
We had a few people who ran into, uh, water and a few fatalities, uh, just a few.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Not more than ten#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
That's funny that, uh, we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much.#Statement-opinion
Well, the, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
there's an old profane expression about Texas weather,#Other
it's always too damn cold, too damn hot, too damn windy#Quotation

uh,#Uninterpretable

I'm going down to El Paso next week#Statement-non-opinion

It's not a, doesn't get that cold, I guess, huh?#Yes-No-Question

it's, it's, quite southern#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The, uh, you'll be flying in there?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Well, uh, take off is, uh, fun from El Paso because you normally,#Statement-opinion
the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain, the Rockies#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they're towering above you#Statement-non-opinion
and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we're kind of used to that here in Utah,#Statement-non-opinion
course, there are mountains,#Statement-non-opinion
and I fly into Montana a lot#Statement-non-opinion
and we have a,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
the mountains are, are really, uh, high#Statement-non-opinion
and a lot of places we go in to, you just kind of, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it's in the little valley,#Statement-non-opinion
but, I, uh, sure hope we,#Statement-non-opinion
we really need the moisture.#Statement-opinion
I hope we can get, uh, get some.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There's supposed to be a storm,#Statement-non-opinion
but it split, went down through, uh, northern Arizona and southern Utah#Statement-non-opinion
and they're not predicting any for the next, uh, week anyway up here#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Well, I noticed on the weather map on, uh, cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into California and on down your way,#Statement-non-opinion
but I guess it didn't pan out, huh?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, that's, that's what the,#Uninterpretable
*#Non-verbal
above, uh,#Uninterpretable
some of it went to the south and some to the north up into Montana,#Statement-non-opinion
so that just left us,#Statement-non-opinion
we got a high pressure#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
system which has been sitting in the air#Other
and, uh, we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had, uh, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, boy.#Appreciation
airport's been shut down, uh, till about noon every day#Statement-non-opinion
and then they seed the clouds, or seed the fog to try to#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to get the airplanes in and out.#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
we, uh, had a bad siege last, uh, Christmas a year ago.#Other
We went up to visit my wife's, uh, sister who lives in, uh, Calgary, Alberta, Can,#Statement-non-opinion

So, uh, you know, my feeling is that, uh, it's really being used today,#Statement-opinion
it, it, you know, it, it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
I think I've seen some statistics that say that, uh, it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life.#Statement-opinion
Right#Agree/Accept
because y-, you, you've got all, all the prison expenses, plus all the legal expenses.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and, you know, it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent. Uh, for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly don't think the people that are committing the c-, crimes that would be eligible, you know, really care.#Statement-opinion
Well, that's,#Uninterpretable
committing them mostly is, you know, either crimes of passion or at the moment#Statement-opinion
or they think they're not going to get caught#Statement-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, it's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon, you know,#Statement-opinion
I'm invulnerable,#Quotation
I don't need to care about this.#Quotation
You know, I, I, I'm#Quotation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
b-,#Uninterpretable
never going to get caught.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis, for example, someone like, uh, Jeffrey Dahlmer,#Statement-opinion
do you want,#Yes-No-Question
by putting him in prison for life, there is still a possibility that he will get out again.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
one, one#Statement-non-opinion
Whereas#Statement-non-opinion
way or another.#Other
if you kill him, there is not that possibility.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, but the other side to that is, if you put him in prison for life, there's a chance that he might do things in prison, or, you know, and somehow redeem himself.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't think he could ever redeem himself,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
in some cases, yes.#Other
You know, so that, you know,#Other
the, the question is, you know, the other qu-, problem with capital punishment you run into is, what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent, you know?#Statement-non-opinion
There are cases where, you know, twenty, thirty years after the fact of getting evidence, especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence, then, oops,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sorry,#Quotation
guess we killed the wrong guy.#Quotation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, it's,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
once you've made a decision that way, it's a little difficult to go back on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you, you can apologize nicely,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, you know, I think, you know, the, the price, you know,#Statement-opinion
it, I've heard quotes, you know, it's better that a thousand people go free, than one person be unjustly imprisoned. I think i-, is really the, the philosophy of the way our legal system works.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's a-,#Uninterpretable
the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is, uh, based on the, uh, person who is accused.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, the, I, I think that, you know,#Statement-opinion
and the way it's being used now, it's like you listen to Bush is, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
well, where are we going to impose d-, you know,#Rhetorical-Questions
it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in,#Statement-non-opinion
Tsongas is also saying, you know, capital, make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, again, I don't thing these people care. *#Statement-opinion
They risk their lives every day.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, there, there, they seem that the profit marg-, uh, drug dealers, the profit margin's so high that, yeah#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the, the risk is almost not there.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and, you know, uh, especially, now, I live in, in Massachusetts, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
w-, w-, we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you know,#Uninterpretable
but you look at our, our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to, to like Texas or someplace that does, you know, it, it, it's impossible to make a case that it's, it's affecting it in any way.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think it's mainly, people, like, they get the vengeance of it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well#Statement-opinion
Because, you know,#Uninterpretable
it's also,#Other
I used to live in Georgia#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, the, the big thing down there was, all right, we have capital punishment,#Statement-non-opinion
but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed, it's very racially related#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah#Agree/Accept
and ethnically related,#Other
it's mainl-, lot of blacks.#Statement-opinion
Also a lot of young people.#Statement-opinion
You know, a, a, a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I've seen.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, I, I think when you listen to like the, uh, the, the victims' families and things, they're always talking about, you know, uh, feeling justified or feeling, you know, like they've gotten something out of it,#Statement-opinion
I mean, my thought has been, once the guy has been imprisoned, if he goes to jail forever or whatever, if he gets killed, it shouldn't make any difference to the, uh, the victim's family.#Statement-opinion
The only thing that should really, I mean,#Statement-opinion
obviously, if someone of mine who has close died, I'd probably feel differently,#Hedge
but#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, th-, you know, what, the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society.#Other
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that,#Uninterpretable
and, you know, also by keeping them in prison, you do have the possibility, though, we don't currently do this, of making restitution.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, the,#Uninterpretable
You, you will work your prison job#Statement-non-opinion
and any money you earn will go to the victim's family.#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, the, the other thing is that, you know, I was reading through a book on, uh, geneo, human geneo research#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and there, more and more things like schizophrenia#Statement-non-opinion
and why, does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say, well, the problem is you, you've got an endorphin imbalance#Statement-opinion
and, you know, if you take this regularly, you'll be a sane and productive member of society#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
you really get back to the question of, you know, is someone responsible for their actions.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I, I think on some of it, you have to say someone's responsible for his actions.#Statement-opinion
I never like the, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Society made me do it.#Collaborative Completion
the defense,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I never liked the, uh, insanity defense.#Other

What kind of crime do you think, uh, is the most prevalent in our society?#Wh-Question
Oh, boy, probably, uh, robberies, people stealing from each other.#Statement-opinion
Such as New York City ?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Is that what happens up there a lot?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, th-, that, that's mostly what I hear, though, is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen.#Statement-non-opinion
That's the most prevalent crime. Uh, the ones that really, you know, the ones that really add up after a while, I guess, you know, from, s-, far as insurance money and stuff like that, insurance costs.#Statement-opinion
You know, everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I, I wonder if, uh, if drug use is a more prevalent crime, though, because, I mean, so many people use it,#Statement-opinion
and even though just using is not really,#Hedge
I mean it is a crime,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, yeah,#Agree/Accept
that, that, that is a crime.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess, uh, when you, when you count all the little things that people do like,#Statement-opinion
uh, speeding is a crime#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's true.#Agree/Accept
I break that law every day#Statement-non-opinion
But I was, I, I was staying in the realm of, of felonies versus misdemeanors#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, drug use,#Other
well, actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, what kind, what kind,#Wh-Question
have you been, uh, have you been the subject of such a crime, such as stealing, or anything?#Yes-No-Question
Well, I've, uh, I've been caught with marijuana before,#Statement-non-opinion
so I guess that was a crime.#Statement-non-opinion
I got a year's probation for that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
That, that's not that much.#Statement-opinion
I mean#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
it wasn't that#Statement-non-opinion
you know, those aren't,#Other
big a deal.#Other
I,#Uninterpretable
Uh, when I think of crime, I think of stuff that, that affects other people like people getting, you know, killed or raped.#Statement-opinion
I think rape is one of the worst crimes#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think it is.#Statement-opinion
I, in some ways, it's almost worse than murder.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's very degrading#Statement-opinion
Uh,#Uninterpretable
and,#Other
Murder, murder is, is hard on the people that were related to#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Other
you know, I mean, it is a rather final solution, though#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right,#Agree/Accept
once, once a person's, you know, gone, then it's,#Statement-non-opinion
but the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
What, what do you think is, uh, is an appropriate, uh, punishment for some of the various, you know, such as, things such as rape or, or, uh, murder#Wh-Question
Well#Statement-opinion
or something like that.#Other
for, for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders, I think the death penalty is,#Other
it's a pretty good thing.#Statement-opinion
I agree with that.#Agree/Accept
They, they have that down here in Florida still.#Statement-opinion
They the electric chair#Statement-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think Virginia does, too, up here.#Statement-opinion
Oh, do they?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
I think, I think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy#Statement-opinion
and, I guess usually they're, they're always sure they got the right guy,#Statement-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think the appeal process takes too long.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
so do I.#Agree/Accept
I think, I, I think it should take, from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
i-, if that.#Statement-opinion
You know, the sooner,#Uninterpretable
a, a, a year's plenty of time#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, for something to come out, I guess.#Other
Then, you know, there's been guys in jail for six years#Statement-non-opinion
and the other guy admits that he did it#Statement-non-opinion
and they#Uninterpretable
it's like oops,#Statement-non-opinion
But,#Other
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, the system isn't perfect,#Statement-opinion
I mean, it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
You do the best you can to make it perfect, you know,#Statement-opinion
you, you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I think you have to accept some of the errors.#Statement-opinion
I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if, if there was a credible punishment, uh, for murderers.#Statement-opinion
Um, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know if it would or not though.#Statement-opinion
I, I don't think it's a, so much of a deterrent as, as it is a, a good, uh, a good way for vengeance, you know, for the relatives and, and family members,#Statement-opinion
you know what I mean?#Yes-No-Question
And society probably, too.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, just general society to,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it kind of gets#Collaborative Completion
Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it off their chest.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it does#Statement-opinion
and, and it decreases the prison population.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And, which is#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know that#Statement-non-opinion
significant#Other
a, a lot of the#Other
I mean,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other.#Other
And they're#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Other
the, kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that.#Other
I don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead,#Statement-opinion
but, I, y-, y-, you might be able to, uh, stop people, you know,#Statement-opinion
they're thinking about it,#Statement-non-opinion
they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
generally the crimes of passion and things like that, uh, are not premeditated.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, they can be,#Hedge
but usually they aren't.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They're spur of the moment#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
and, uh, the premeditated murders, the ones where the person plots and plans, when you catch those, those individuals, I think that you, you end up with a, uh, uh, how do I want to, you end up with a s-, you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they could p-, probably do it again.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
they, they would have no problems doing it again.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
they didn't have any time doing it the first time.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think locking them up for, you know, fifty years doesn't do a, any good because#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
it do-,#Uninterpretable
as a, as a taxpayer, I'm going to pay, you know, one and a,#Other

Well, Kathleen, do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system?#Yes-No-Question
I certainly do.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh, I think ...#Statement-opinion
And what do you think that problem is?#Wh-Question
I think we have a lousy school system.#Other
And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we don't train our teachers very well.#Statement-opinion
And then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents.#Statement-opinion
And then,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
oh, we don't, uh, we put too much, uh, responsibility on the teachers,#Other
.#Non-verbal
for things that are really not education.#Other
They're social services.#Statement-opinion
Huh. That seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before.#Statement-opinion
Well, I, as a matter of fact, I just finished editing a book on the topic.#Statement-non-opinion
So I have some rather strong opinions.#Statement-non-opinion
That's interesting.#Appreciation
Do you, uh, yourself ...#Uninterpretable
And, and I'm sure they're colored by what I've edited.#Statement-non-opinion
Do youself have children wi-, who are or have been through the public school system?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
I do.#Statement-non-opinion
And I was not very happy with the results.#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Response Acknowledgement
So if you were to improve it, what would you do to improve it?#Wh-Question
Well, I think I would start with a -bout, with getting rid of about two-thirds of the administrators.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And all the auxiliary personnel. The school bureaucracy that exists mainly to perpetuate itself.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then I would provide, uh, use the money that we've paying them to, uh, provide some special help in training and particularly, uh, mentor teachers#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then let them try some innovative things and see what#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
works. And then, uh, have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who could benefit from the same sorts of things.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then from the parents' side, have the parents support the school. Get involved.#Other
Pay attention to what's happening. Talk to the teachers. Uh, talk to their kids about school. And support the institution#Statement-non-opinion
and, a-,#Uninterpretable
instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the, uh, the teacher's in the middle.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's, uh, some pretty good ideas.#Appreciation
Why don't you do something with those ?#Action-directive
Well, I've done about all I can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you should, uh, run for a school board position.#Action-directive
Oh, well. That I'm not so sure about.#Reject
I've got a lot of things to keep me busy.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That ...#Uninterpretable
Have you done anything like that?#Yes-No-Question
Anything political?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, my mother was on the school board.#Other answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
As we were coming up.#Other
And, uh, that, basically, is the extent to which our, our family has been directly, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
they've always been involved.#Statement-non-opinion
My parents through the, the P T A organization.#Statement-non-opinion
And my mother was on the school board for eight years.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, that was, that's the extent of which I guess that's more than, than some people, less than others#Statement-non-opinion
That's more than a lot#Statement-opinion
I would, uh, tend to agree with you that there is a problem#Statement-non-opinion
The methods of correcting it I haven't thought through quite to the detail which you have.#Statement-non-opinion
But I believe that there's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of even being a teacher.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And if there was a way to, through the public mind, set that image to be a little higher esteem, a little, uh, uh, a little more prestige to being a teacher.#Statement-non-opinion
And with that, of course, you know, you have to pay them a, accordingly.#Statement-non-opinion
If we paid them more, it would attract more the, the higher educated people to, to either move into that field or to continue in that field.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then if you paid them more, you'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that's absolutely right.#Agree/Accept
They,#Uninterpretable
the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board, you're going to be,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
uh, rewarding people who've been doing a lousy job. And#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
instead of getting the, uh, improvement that we want.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So we'd have to have some way to, uh, reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them a,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
a pat on the back and respect and some honor and#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
more money.#Other
It, unfortunately, it's a, and it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, it's hard to tell.#Statement-opinion
as other ones#Other
so it's very, it's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one, other than I guess how, you kn-, how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class.#Statement-opinion
You know, if there's some gauge that they could make.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, also, I've alw-, I've thought around about the idea of making teaching and the#Statement-non-opinion
before you can get a certificate, you have a, a certain residency period. So much like a doctor.#Statement-non-opinion
Maybe not the four years definitely.#Statement-non-opinion
But some certain type of, of position where you're overseen to begin with.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now that's a very good suggestion.#Appreciation
Uh, just something to, i-,#Uninterpretable
rather than throw someone in, into that environment, uh, you know, it#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I don't think#Statement-opinion
I thought that maybe something.#Uninterpretable
student, I don't think student teaching is enough.#Other
I think#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, at least what I used to observe in student teaching, was that some college kid who might not be all that bright to begin with, was thrown into a class room with a teacher who was harried and overworked and, uh, had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to pay much attention to the student teacher.#Other
And then the student teacher didn't stay but about six weeks.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So there really was no time to try,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the, the student teacher improve very much.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There are lots of things that could be done in that line, including things like video taping. Because it wouldn't be hard with all the electronic equipment that's around these days to video tape, uh, either a master teacher teaching a class so that then,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
students could watch that and, uh, criticize the methods used and, and analyze it. Figure out what worked and what didn't work.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then also to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's good as a, a, a teaching aid.#Statement-opinion
But more you see these commercials that have Jimmy walking into class late and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who is in New York while Jimmy's in Rome.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I don't know if I I'm in favor#Statement-non-opinion
I don't think that's going to work.#Statement-opinion
yeah, in favor of, yeah,#Other
I think, especially in the younger years you need to have more of the, the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to, to learn how to learn.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, another thing I think would be helpful would be to have some sort of, of say a national curriculum. Because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for, uh, curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in Texas and California.#Statement-opinion
And then everybody else is stuck with that, regardless of what they want to teach.#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Is that#Yes-No-Question
Because it ...#Uninterpretable
because that's where the two biggest markets are#Other
or?#Uninterpretable
Well, that's the two states that adopt on a state wide basis.#Negative non-no answers
I see.#Response Acknowledgement
Uh, and so it, uh,#Uninterpretable
I used to work for a textbook publisher#Statement-non-opinion
and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by Texas, then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject#Statement-non-opinion
and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the individual school districts.#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, you know, a third of the Texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then the states that either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids, just have to follow along and take what Texas gets.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
California is the biggest for elementary schools#Statement-non-opinion
but Texas, uh, adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade.#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, definitely is a national problem if, that they need to address.#Statement-opinion
Yep.#Agree/Accept
Sure is.#Appreciation
Definitely is.#Agree/Accept
And I hope maybe we're going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with, uh, Reagan's, uh, new education secretary and, uh, you know, trying to do some, uh, trying to produce some new programs anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Excuse me.#Apology
Well, I've enjoyed speaking with you.#Conventional-closing

I've got another line calling.#Conventional-closing

I guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Well, lots, right?#Yes-No-Question
Right#Affirmative non-yes answers
Finally.#Other
Really,#Agree/Accept
what, what do you do, now?#Wh-Question
Well, we have saved our newspapers for years and years#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because the, uh, Boy Scouts#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
our boys have been involved in have, uh, had a huge recycling bin, over at Resurrection Lutheran Church#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, so we've done that for quite some time,#Statement-non-opinion
but since the price of paper has gone down#Statement-non-opinion
like it's about a fifth of what it used to be#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
so the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the City took it over.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So now we just put ours out for the City of Plano.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you live in Plano?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Have you had yours now?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Although just, just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that, uh, work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's why I asked you.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess it * Why treated as a slash unit when it continues in B.28?#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, it does go in cycles, * I would treat this as a continuation of B.26 utt2 and label it ''#Statement-non-opinion
and not everyone got theirs right away.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I, I was so relieved because I've been making a real concerted effort, make, you know, recycling the aluminum and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal-Mart collected it.#Other
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we used#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh#Uninterpretable
to take ours there.#Other
my garage was just getting overwhelmed.#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
And, of course, I didn't go weekly,#Statement-non-opinion
so it became quite a big#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
thing,#Other
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Right,#Agree/Accept
I'm really glad they do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, yeah,#Uninterpretable
I do news, mostly newspapers and, uh, plastic two liter diet Coke bottles#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And aluminum cans some,#Other
but I don't use as many of those.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really, that are really dirty that you have to wash out#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well, I found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, ha.#Appreciation
Uh, ha,#Repeat-phrase
so it was wasting a lot of time. * Why no slash? B's next utterance is a backchannel to A.49.#Statement-non-opinion
Wasting all your time and effort and,#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah. * Should be independent slash unit#Other
Putting it in there.#Other
Thinking I was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, you know, but it, it's not that hard now that I've got this#Statement-non-opinion
Got your routine down.#Collaborative Completion
system under control.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I guess there are some places, uh, in the north, in particular that, uh, have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle#Statement-non-opinion
because they charge you, let's see, they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So if you recycle things, of course, then you don't have all that weight in there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do find that I don't have as much to throw away#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because#Other

all the bulky things are, are#Other

And, uh, I don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
what are some of the things they don't recycle.#Self-talk
Oh, one thing I thought about the other day were batteries,#Statement-non-opinion
just everyday regular batteries.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
Supposedly, you know, leak and, and contaminate#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the landfills#Other
and, yet, what am I going to do when I have a couple double A batteries to toss out.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
And they don't take,#Statement-non-opinion
Probably going to throw them in your trash#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's what happens#Statement-non-opinion
because,#Uninterpretable
Well, there are places that take car batteries,#Statement-non-opinion
but I wonder if they would take,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, not that it would#Statement-non-opinion
kind of a pain to, you know, drive over somewhere special just for that, for two little tiny batteries#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
but I think the city one could possibly look into that or something.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
Uh, if they've got these bins for all the other little items,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sure if p-, people will have batteries, uh, you know, quite often#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
to, to toss out.#Other
Uh, when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving and the, uh, the truck came by, well, we all ran out to watch it because, you know, we'd never really seen it#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
pick up our stuff#Other
and one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he, uh, scanned across the little bar code#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on our bin#Other
Oh, is that right?#Backchannel in question form
as soon as he took the stuff#Other
and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just, you know, scanned it,#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't know why, what that was reading it for#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
but, uh#Uninterpretable
Registering our garbage#Summarize/reformulate
they must be trying to keep track of , you know, who is doing it, or what, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know.#Hedge
Another,#Uninterpretable
Wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year#Rhetorical-Questions
Ooh, for those who are really cooperating.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now, that would encourage it.#Statement-opinion
Well, except I know it would just not be cost effective.#Statement-opinion
They've already got all this money out on hiring, uh, getting the trucks and hiring people to work them.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sure they couldn't afford#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that.#Other
But#Uninterpretable
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh,#Uninterpretable
But the garbage, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
now there is just one garbage man that comes#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on the truck instead of two.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that's interesting.#Statement-opinion
Uh, also, slightly off the subject, but our, our big green garbage thing got stolen.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, it did?#Backchannel in question form
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Gosh.#Appreciation
And we c-, we called the City#Statement-non-opinion

Oh, my goodness.#Appreciation
Isn't that sad?#Yes-No-Question
It is sad.#Affirmative non-yes answers
You know.#Other
And just,#Uninterpretable
You know,#Uninterpretable
they paid for those things anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, and they must be,#Statement-opinion
Or, our taxes do.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah, really expensive.#Other
I mean, of course, we were hoping we weren't, we weren't going to have to pay for it, you know#Statement-non-opinion

I used to ha-, uh, have a friend that owned, his daddy owned a boat shop.#Statement-non-opinion

I'd like to do some sailing.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's a lot of fun.#Statement-non-opinion

especially if you get a, a pretty fast boat#Statement-non-opinion
like those catamarans are pretty fast.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
what,#Uninterpretable
You can actually,#Uninterpretable
Do, if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that#Yes-No-Question

Uh, my family's pretty into it#Statement-non-opinion

and, uh, I took sailing lessons when I was about six#Statement-non-opinion
and then, uh#Uninterpretable
Is it pretty easy?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
it, it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while, you know, uh, just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and, and the physics behind it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's, it's not too bad,#Statement-non-opinion
it's pretty easy to get the hang of, I think#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, generally, everybody I've, I've known has kind of gotten into it,#Statement-non-opinion
but some people are more motorboaters, you know#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which is fine.#Other
Well, that's about all we have#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
lot of people don't, don't see the excitement in sailing,#Statement-opinion
but, then, again, they may nev-, m-, they may never have tried anything like, uh, catamaran#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, that's when you really start getting into speed. You know,#Statement-non-opinion
you actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people behind, the skiers,#Statement-non-opinion
they get so fast, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't know that.#Statement-non-opinion

they get pretty quick,#Statement-non-opinion

for me, I, I go back to Orlando, uh, in about a month, and so, down there, basically just go to the coast.#Statement-non-opinion
We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast,#Statement-non-opinion

If you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then it can be kind of bad.#Other
I know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the Ozarks,#Statement-non-opinion

So, so he does not live there though?#Yes-No-Question

Vacation home.#Summarize/reformulate

Just a few.#Statement-non-opinion
It just depends,#Statement-non-opinion

Are you all located in Texas?#Yes-No-Question

It is near Lake Texoma.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, all of his children live in the Dallas area too.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That to me is,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
Dallas I know of,#Statement-non-opinion
Houston I know of,#Statement-non-opinion
and that is about it#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In Texas.#Other
The rest of it is sort of a big void to me.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, you know, we have, uh, well,#Uninterpretable
we all got together,#Statement-non-opinion
it was about two years ago for,#Statement-non-opinion
I was,#Uninterpretable
I had graduated from college.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, I was going to live in France for a year.#Statement-non-opinion
And so my parents invited,#Statement-non-opinion
it was not just family,#Statement-non-opinion
it was friends too.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, we all got together for just a party.#Statement-non-opinion
And that was kind of fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Nice to have everybody together at once and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
French reunion?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well,#Dispreferred answers
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
not quite French,#Other
but, uh, it was sort of a reunion before leaving.#Statement-non-opinion
It was fun.#Statement-non-opinion
It was on, uh, New Year's Day.#Statement-non-opinion
So it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was kind of fun.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, but who was it?#Hold before answer/agreement
A friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend.#Statement-non-opinion
And it really sounded like it was fun.#Statement-non-opinion
But, I am not quite sure what I would do.#Statement-non-opinion
I think it would be fun to like rent a big mansion or house someplace,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And have different areas to explore and things like that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that would be kind of fun.#Statement-non-opinion
Meet in the middle.#Collaborative Completion
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Other
Where nobody lives#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But at least that way it is at nobody's house, so nobody one, no one person is responsible for everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they do not have to clean up afterwards.#Statement-non-opinion
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That is for sure.#Appreciation
The cleaning up can be a mess.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But uh, do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm?#Yes-No-Question
I am, I am sorry?#Signal-non-understanding
Does, does your dad have horses there?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, no,#No answers
he does not really have any, any, uh, uh, domestic livestock anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, he leased, uh, to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on.#Statement-non-opinion
I see,#Response Acknowledgement
so it's,#Uninterpretable
so he really does use it as a vacation home.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
It is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Yes answers
Pretty much.#Statement-non-opinion
He has a garden and, uh, a lot of fruit trees#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and blueberry bushes and things.#Other
Well, that sounds nice.#Appreciation
Do people actually pick the fruit and things?#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
And then there is wild blackberries there too.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, used to,#Statement-non-opinion
he gets,#Uninterpretable
we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend's property,#Other
but we never got enough.#Statement-non-opinion
I used to make jam,#Statement-non-opinion
but I never had enough to really make, you know, more than a jar or something.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it was not so worth it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It is kind of, they're kind of off and on it seems like.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Depends on the rain.#Statement-non-opinion
That sounds,#Appreciation
is,#Uninterpretable
does he have a lot of land to go walking#Yes-No-Question
Uh,#Uninterpretable
around and things there?#Other
it is, uh, it is, uh, eighty acres.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Well, that is pretty big#Appreciation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do not know how they do scale down there.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, here it would be a huge amount of land.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because they,#Uninterpretable
per-, is#Uninterpretable
this house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
As opposed to#Other
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
tens of acres.#Other
and most of it, you know,#Uninterpretable
you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, because that is where the ponds are and where everybody fishes.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We kind of have a, an informal contest.#Statement-non-opinion
My uncle, uh, put some bass in, uh, his pond a few years ago.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, he put some crappie too.#Statement-non-opinion
But the bass,#Statement-non-opinion
we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they are in there, but they are real spooky.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think my dad put some.#Statement-non-opinion
We have a little pond at our, at his vacation home too.#Statement-non-opinion
And, y-,#Uninterpretable
I mean really little.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in,#Statement-non-opinion
and there were too many little goldfish,#Statement-non-opinion
and so the big ones never got bigger.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, somebody suggested to get a bass.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again#Statement-non-opinion
Never saw the bass?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
So we do not know whether it is living#Statement-non-opinion
or,#Uninterpretable
Oh, it is probably in there just burping goldfish.#Statement-opinion
Yep.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We still have lots of little goldfish.#Statement-non-opinion
They propagate pretty well, those little fish.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they really do.#Statement-non-opinion
because we started,#Uninterpretable
we have got hundreds in there now,#Statement-non-opinion
and we started with, I think, ten or twenty little feeder fish that I picked up for a dollar, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
ma-, no matter how many it was for a dollar.#Other
And,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and some of them are probably eight inches long.#Other
But he wants your really big ones, you know, the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It,#Uninterpretable
They ha-,#Uninterpretable
there is a, uh,#Uninterpretable
you might put some, like some yellow catfish in there.#Action-directive
I do not know if they would live very well up in New York,#Statement-non-opinion
but they get huge.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, they routinely use them for bait for, uh, goldfish for bait#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
for yellow catfish.#Other
Well, we would want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys, the goldfish too#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We could see.#Statement-non-opinion
I do not know if yellow catfish live up this way.#Statement-non-opinion
But catfish do, I think.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and up into Canada.#Other
So, that,#Uninterpretable
you mean,#Uninterpretable
well, we could try it.#Statement-non-opinion
That is a good idea.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because he was trying to catch them, you know, using little, uh, -h, -h,#Statement-non-opinion
I forget,#Hold before answer/agreement
there's little, uh, nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Minnow nets or something.#Other
Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
My father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish.#Statement-non-opinion
And it was really funny,#Statement-non-opinion
because, uh, one time he left the net in the pond,#Statement-non-opinion
and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
And, uh, he left it in the middle of the pond#Statement-non-opinion
And that night he came out, and the trap was gone.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh#Uninterpretable
And it was a raccoon that had taken it.#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Other
So it was really funny.#Statement-non-opinion
And you could see that, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
you could see where the trap, the trap was dragged and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That is what happens#Statement-non-opinion
But do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah#Yes answers
And, uh, we feed the catfish.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Uninterpretable
They feed the catfish like, uh, every couple of weeks.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, and sometimes that is the best time to catch them.#Statement-non-opinion
When they are feeding?#Other
Yeah.#Yes answers
Because they will just, they will just come after anything then.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you could catch a couple anyway#Statement-non-opinion
What#Wh-Question
during that time.#Other
do you feed them?#Other
Uh, mixed Purina, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it is, uh, cat food, uh, catfish food.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
And it is#Declarative Yes-No-Question
But,#Uninterpretable
especially made for catfish.#Other
Yeah.#Yes answers
Well, I do not know how much different it is from dog food but, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it is, uh, it looks like Purina High Pro.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That is funny.#Appreciation
But they come up to the top.#Statement-non-opinion
And it is the best time to take pictures,#Statement-non-opinion
because they come up to the top, and you can see their whiskers come through the water.#Statement-non-opinion
And#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're,#Other
the ca-, the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have never seen catfish, you know, except in fi-, filleted on a plate, I think maybe.#Statement-non-opinion
I think I have seen once or twice in like the museum.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I have never seen them,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
just alive someplace.#Other
That would be fun to see.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they are really funny fish.#Appreciation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
When you catch them, they make a kind of a, a burping, growling sound at you.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they try to hit you with their tails.#Statement-non-opinion
How big do they get?#Wh-Question
Oh, well, the channel catfish get up to, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I think the world record is fifty some pounds.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay. But how long in feet?#Wh-Question
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Do you know?#Yes-No-Question
that, that is only about three and a half feet long.#Statement-non-opinion
That is pretty big though.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they get real fat.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, from the time,#Uninterpretable
they, they stay slender until they get to be, uh, eighteen inches long, and then they start to widen#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
out.#Other
Uh, my daughter, we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing#Statement-non-opinion
And I think that was when she was three.#Statement-non-opinion
And she caught a catfish by accident.#Statement-non-opinion
She was fishing for sunfish.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And she said, "Here," and she handed me her rod and reel#Statement-non-opinion
And, and, uh, you know, it was just pulling drag out.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it swimmed wherever it wanted to.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That sounds amazing.#Appreciation
I will have to see them sometime.#Offers, Options Commits
But, all righty.#Other
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was nice talking#Conventional-closing
Nice talking#Conventional-closing
to you.#Other
to you too.#Other
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Enjoy your, uh, weekend.#Conventional-closing
Yeah.#Conventional-closing
Have a nice Memorial weekend.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
You too.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay,#Other
I guess it took,#Statement-opinion
so I guess the recording has started now.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh.#Uninterpretable
So, have you ever served on a jury?#Yes-No-Question
I served,#Statement-non-opinion
I was in the Air Force, and served on a court martial, uh, board a couple of times, which is very similar to a jury.#Statement-non-opinion
A lot of the same rules apply.#Statement-non-opinion
Have you ever served on one?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I finally served on one last year.#Statement-non-opinion
I've, um, been voting for years,#Statement-non-opinion
and I couldn't figure out why I hadn't been called yet#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I finally was.#Statement-non-opinion
So it was an interesting experience.#Statement-opinion
I was kind of boring. *#Statement-opinion
Was it civil or criminal?#Or-Clause
Uh, it was, uh#Statement-non-opinion
A grand jury or,#Or-Clause
uh, it was, uh, well, let's see, it was municipal court#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it was a combination of, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and I was in the pool for a couple of weeks#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it was a combination of criminal and civil,#Statement-non-opinion
and they had, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
well most of the time we, we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then, it was always exciting when we got called to, to, to go, because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides, uh, just sit in the jury room.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, did, did the judge, uh, hand down sentences#Yes-No-Question
or did you folks do that?#Or-Clause
Uh, yeah,#Yes answers
the judge did.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I, uh, I had a hard time getting seated on a jury.#Statement-non-opinion
I kept getting, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I'd be questioned, uh, for empaneling the jury,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they kept, uh, dismissing me.#Other
Um.#Uninterpretable
Course they don't have to give a reason,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's just#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like, you know,#Other
they want to get the best, uh, mix for their case,#Statement-opinion
so#Statement-opinion
That#Statement-opinion
they ask all kinds of wild questions.#Other
that's a science in itself.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think part of it was they didn't, uh, they didn't like the fact that I don't drink any more.#Statement-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Because you'd probably be, uh, too puritanical#Summarize/reformulate
and#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that was#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
probably it,#Other
although in my case I might have been more, uh, sympathetic with the person who got caught,#Statement-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
So, uh, were, were the, uh, sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair,#Yes-No-Question
or would,#Or-Clause
if you were deciding, do you think that they would have been different.#Yes-No-Question
Well, I was never there, never there for any sentencing.#Hold before answer/agreement
Uh, I finally got empaneled on one case, uh, on my next to the last day,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we got into the, uh, jury room to, uh, decide the case,#Statement-non-opinion
and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate, because he'd already decided that the guy was, uh, not guilty,#Statement-non-opinion
and he would never vote for guilty.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
So, uh, they appointed me jury, jury foreman#Statement-non-opinion
and I, uh, didn't think that, uh, going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict,#Statement-opinion
so I told the judge that we weren't, were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
So the whole thing had to be tried over again.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow,#Appreciation
I bet that made him happy.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it was, uh, it was funny.#Statement-opinion
The, uh,#Uninterpretable
I ju-, I, I don't know,#Hedge
I, uh, I didn't, uh, uh, I didn't like not being able to deliberate.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, uh, I, I wanted to vote guilty for the guy,#Statement-non-opinion
and the other people were kind of mixed#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, uh, the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again.#Statement-non-opinion
Cost him a lot of money,#Statement-opinion
I'm sure.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, how many members were on the jury?#Wh-Question
Was it a six or twelve member jury?#Or-Clause
Uh, it must have been six.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's kind of curious to me.#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't realize until the, uh, Wayne Kennedy Smith trial, uh, a few months ago that they had six member juries.#Statement-non-opinion
I thought that they, you know, it was always twelve, twelve men tried and true, so to speak.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
But, uh, apparently for some, some crimes, it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment.#Statement-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
I know on a#Statement-non-opinion
getting to this unanimous thing, whether, you know, a jury should be unanimous or not, or not, in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a simple majority, you know, rules.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, let's#Hedge
.#Non-verbal
see,#Other
is it on, uh, capital crimes that they have to be unanimous#Yes-No-Question
and,#Uninterpretable
Probably on capital,#Affirmative non-yes answers
I don't know,#Hedge
we weren't, we, we,#Uninterpretable
the two that I were on had to do with drugs#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, we were, uh, unanimous is acquitting the person, even though we in our, in our, uh, gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends, because of various things,#Statement-non-opinion
the government really failed to prove its case,#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, being fair to the person, if the government doesn't prove its case, no matter how you feel, you have to go by what's offered as proof,#Statement-non-opinion
and we had to acquit him in both cases.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, it was too circumstantial?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh, yeah,#Yes answers
it was, yeah, in some of the critical things, like the off-, special investigations, at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person,#Statement-non-opinion
but something happened to the camera and the tape and#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
all they could do was testify,#Statement-non-opinion

I, uh, get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, that is one of my big sources for current events information.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I really like that coverage.#Statement-non-opinion
My wife, uh, on the other hand is home most of the day#Statement-non-opinion
and she watches a lot of the cable news network.#Statement-non-opinion
Have you seen, uh, h-, have you, uh, ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
we don't have the, uh, national public radio in, in my area.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can hear it at the, uh, uh, oh, the college town nearby when I'm in Stillwater, which is about an hour away,#Statement-non-opinion
but the F M signal doesn't reach this far.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit.#Statement-non-opinion
It gives you a whole different perspective on the news, uh, when you hear it from, say, a European#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
point of view, or from the country of origin.#Other
Uh, I agree with you, too, on the, uh, uh, the cable channel, C N N and HEADLINE NEWS.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, which is why I rely on shortwave and, and then the cable,#Other
.#Non-verbal
cable, C N N.#Other
I'm, uh, interested in the, in the shortwave aspect of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, how do you find that the, the coverage from other places in the world uh, compares with the American coverage of,#Open-Question
how do you think that, uh, the viewpoints differ?#Open-Question
I think a lot of it is just, uh, the fact that in the U S you're so far removed, uh, in a lot of cases from, say, conflicts#Statement-opinion
or, or it's not happening in your backyard#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it's, it's more of a, it's not as a personal, uh, the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than, than what's on shortwave.#Statement-opinion
It's, B B C is, uh, oh, I don't know the right word, is, is almost, uh,#Statement-opinion
they almost take all emotions out of it when they#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
report it#Other
and it just,#Uninterpretable
they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions.#Statement-opinion
Do you think, then, that, uh, the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, very much so,#Affirmative non-yes answers
very much so,#Affirmative non-yes answers
and I, I think a lot of it is, uh, especially T V news,#Statement-opinion
they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
uh, oh, to really decipher the news and to really explain it.#Other
I mean, I, you know, I think it's important to interpret it,#Statement-opinion
but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to, to do the interpreting.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which, uh, which approach do you find to be, uh, more useful, the, the interpretive approach or the straight reporting?#Or-Clause
Oh, I like the straight reporting.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and then I, I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I always think it's humorous when, when the President gives the State of the Union and, uh, for thirty minutes#Statement-opinion
and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they, what they write into it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I, overall, I think I would rather hear just straight reporting.#Statement-non-opinion
One of the things that I found interesting last year during the, uh, the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against, uh, Peter Arnett, who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting, uh, some of the things that were available.#Statement-opinion
Uh, there was a, there was, uh, a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely, uh, uh, hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory,#Statement-non-opinion
and while he was being severely, uh, censored and could not make any judgment call on this, it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda,#Statement-non-opinion
but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that, th-, you know, this isn't a baby milk factory,#Statement-non-opinion
how could he say it was, uh,#Rhetorical-Questions
I, I think that,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having the, not just the facts, but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I think people are, people have that opinion.#Statement-opinion
They, they want to sit down in front of the TV and, uh, or at a, read a magazine or U S A TODAY and read in four paragraphs, uh, and, and find out every-,#Statement-opinion

pretty good,#Other
pretty good.#Other
So we're talking about drug testing in the work place, huh. *#Yes-No-Question
Drug testing in the work place.#Repeat-phrase
Um. I've been tested a few times, just before pre-, drug employment.#Statement-non-opinion
But that's about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I've never had random drug testing.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we have random drug testing at, in my business,#Statement-non-opinion
but I've never been, uh, never had to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah,#Yes answers
they started that about a year ago,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it's mostly for the, the field people that, you know, drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,#Statement-non-opinion
at least that's.#Uninterpretable
Oh, they do with alcohol.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Pardon?#Signal-non-understanding
They do it with alcohol?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah,#Yes answers
they, they, they'll check for alcohol.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine.#Statement-opinion
No,#Reject
once, once you start doing that stuff, you sort of, you're sort of stuck into, uh, checking for the whole, the whole thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh. That's interesting.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's a,#Uninterpretable
What type of field of work are you in?#Wh-Question
I'm in the oil business.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, in the oil business.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Okay,#Response Acknowledgement
and you work in the office around.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I work in the office,#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh, it's pretty, pretty safe environment.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
see, I work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make the safety bags#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for the cars,#Other
and we work around a lot of explosives.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, uh, straight on.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that's, you know,#Uninterpretable
I'm all for it, because the, well, the type of environment I work in, you know, they're working with explosives,#Statement-non-opinion
and so they could blow up the whole,#Statement-opinion
well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use,#Statement-non-opinion
but still, it can be dangerous.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
well, I, I, I agree.#Agree/Accept
I think that, uh, you know, under certain circumstances, especially when you're working in, in high risk, uh, uh, industries, where you can really hurt other people, that, that you need to have that kind of stuff.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Uninterpretable
if it's,#Uninterpretable
as long as it's not abused, uh, you know, random, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
as long as it's random, and, and the individual's rights are, uh, are protected, I don't have that big a problem with it.#Statement-non-opinion
Now do they fire them, or do they?#Or-Clause
Well, see, this is it,#Hold before answer/agreement
this is where I start having my problems with my company.#Statement-non-opinion
I work for a private company,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the policy is something like, see if I can re-, state this correctly now. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem, then you're eligible for company counseling.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But if they catch you, if you test positive for a, a controlled substance, then you get fired.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
So, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos.#Statement-opinion
Huh, that's.#Uninterpretable
I think our policy is that,#Statement-opinion
all right, it's probably the same thing.#Statement-opinion
I'm not really sure what the#Hedge
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's one of those things that you read once,#Statement-opinion
and then, if you, if you're not worried about it, you just forget about it#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
But I know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm not sure if#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
our company's a little tougher on the second chance.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, if, if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in, then they ought to, you know, go out of the way, I think, a little bit more to, uh, to help you get, help get you rehabilitated to, you know, to get get back at your job.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, when you're not, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, do you think it works very good with that random, do you think it limits,#Yes-No-Question
Well, it's, it's hard for me to, to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment#Other answers
and, you know, it's not,#Uninterpretable
I guess I ha-, haven't run into anybody that's, that's had a problem that's, that's been a problem.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, so I gue-, you know, I guess it works, uh, much like, uh, well, shoot, like any lottery,#Statement-opinion
I mean, everybody's got an equal chance to get picked.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, I'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the A -s and B -s are going to be in#Statement-opinion
and next week,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
C -s and D -s are going to come in#Other
You could time it just right.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
I know one employee,#Statement-non-opinion
I know, when I was working with, he had alcohol on his breath,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.#Statement-non-opinion
That'd be just as dangerous.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Well, especially around, uh, you know, equipment, machinery and stuff.#Statement-opinion
Huh. That's true.#Agree/Accept
You know, I've, I've gone out and had a, had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do they give any limits on alcohol,#Yes-No-Question
or is it?#Or-Clause
Uh, I don't remember, to tell you the truth.#Other answers
I don't think they do.#Statement-opinion
Um, well, they must,#Statement-opinion
I mean, gee whiz.#Appreciation
That just shows you how much I've been paying attention,#Statement-non-opinion
because I, I really don't know.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you know, you can take some of that, that testing a little bit too far.#Statement-opinion
Uh, there was a company in Houston that,#Statement-non-opinion
they did, uh, an unannounced drug sweep of the, of their company#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
oh, it was, it was, it was an unannounced sweep of, of,#Statement-non-opinion
it was not only drugs,#Statement-non-opinion

Hi,#Conventional-opening
what do you do with your credit cards?#Open-Question
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Well, my husband and I have gotten into some, some problems with credit cards.#Statement-non-opinion
We don't handle them very well#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
We, we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, jeez.#Appreciation
They, they're, they're really bad for us.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, matter of fact, we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and we pretty much keep those maxed out.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I was going to say that, that sounds like, like pretty many.#Statement-non-opinion
But I see what you meant,#Statement-non-opinion
you had them for each of the individual stores.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
we had cre-, I had probably twenty credit cards#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for,#Other
I had, I had an American Express, American Express Gold, an Optima, all the different department stores, um, two Visas, two MasterCards#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gee.#Appreciation
I mean, I had,#Statement-non-opinion
any time anybody would, you know, send me an application, you know, preapproved or whatever, I went, I took it,#Statement-non-opinion
and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, sure.#Agree/Accept
Um, because, see, the more credit cards you have, the more people offer them to you.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
And the more you use them, the more they send them to you.#Statement-opinion
But each of these had an annual fee also, right.#Yes-No-Question
Exactly.#Affirmative non-yes answers
The American Express was probably the worst, um, because with the Gold card,#Statement-non-opinion
I can't remember how much it was because I didn't even have it very long before I gave it up#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I know the Green card was like thirty-five, forty- five dollars a year.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
forty five.#Reject
Right, uh,#Uninterpretable
I,#Uninterpretable
Which was a lot,#Statement-opinion
because I mean, you had to pay it in full every month.#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly, you know,#Agree/Accept
I, that's it,#Agree/Accept
I really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards,#Statement-non-opinion
so I sent back all of mine, except the ones that were free.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, then, then I also limited it to one of each, one MasterCard and one Visa,#Statement-non-opinion
and here, most of the stores will accept those,#Statement-non-opinion
and actually I then got a Discover card since they pay you back.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I had a Discover,#Statement-non-opinion
and that was one of the ones in the group that I ended up, um, closing.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, it really wasn't my choice, though.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I ended up having, I ended up actually losing my credit cards.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I ended up going through a credit counseling service#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, because my husband and I just don't handle credit very well#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, when, when you do that, they automatically, once you start with their service, they close your accounts out.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I'm still paying on all these accounts,#Statement-non-opinion
but my accounts are closed.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, and I would prefer to keep it that way.#Statement-non-opinion
Once we, once we're paid off#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, I would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa#Other
and that's it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Actually I pay off my cards every month.#Statement-non-opinion
Only once in my life have I not paid.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that's a really good way to handle it, because that way, if you, if you paid off every month, you never have to worry about, well, how much do I have to pay these guys, you know, this month, you know.#Statement-opinion
This, you buy what you can afford.#Statement-opinion
I mean#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash#Other
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
it's a lot easier to keep it in check.#Other
Well, and also in a sense, they're giving you a loan for a month#Statement-non-opinion
so that#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, if I were smarter, I would have that same amount in savings and get the interest, which I don't#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
do,#Other
but, but yeah,#Uninterpretable
the, the thought of adding, you know, X percent to, to the price of what I buy,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I,#Statement-opinion
I just, I can't accept.#Other
and I think at this, at this point in time with the economy the way it is, I think that, um, it's going to get even worse.#Other
Um, I'm, I'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off, now, um, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
we, only we started this last year#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we probably still have about another year to go#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
before we're completely out of the hole.#Other
But I think this, they way the whole economy is going right now, it's just not good to be in debt.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
that, I would, that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that I was, you know, juggling payments to different people#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess because I never experienced it.#Other
And it's not, because you know, I'm rich or anything,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just, a mental concept that I have.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Other
that I just.#Uninterpretable
Well, when you, when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle, and if you really get into the mind set, I got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was scary, because I was so good at it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I thought, this is not right.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, this has got to stop, because eventually it'd end up catching up at, catching up with me#Quotation
and it hit me in the face.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it sounds like, you know, you, you learned from it#Summarize/reformulate
and you're coming out of it all right.#Summarize/reformulate
I, yeah,#Agree/Accept
I have,#Agree/Accept
I've learned a lot from it.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my husband's too, because he's, he's the same way I am.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't, I don't think that,#Uninterpretable
well, when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
until the bill comes in.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then all of a sudden you look at the bill#Statement-opinion
and you go, Oh my gosh,#Statement-opinion
I spent this much.#Quotation
But now, the fact that you still have two cards,#Uninterpretable
are you, do you use them, more judiciously?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
we pretty much use them for emergency type things like transmission fell out on our car#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that paid for a new transmission#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, and, and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, and we try not to use them for#Statement-non-opinion

incidental type things, like, you know, gas and stuff like that.#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Clothing, sales.#Declarative Yes-No-Question

Sales I find are a pain.#Statement-non-opinion

I've, I've gotten, I've gotten a lot more away from, from credit cards,#Statement-non-opinion
and I pay by check a lot more now.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, it sounds good, you know.#Appreciation
Like I said, it sounds like you're, you've really got it under control.#Summarize/reformulate
I, I admire you for having, having that mind set for not, not even getting, you know, past the thirty days,#Statement-non-opinion
I would, that's ideally the where, where I would like to be.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and like I said, once, once it, it happened I couldn't because my son's tuition came due,#Statement-non-opinion
and I guess I had, you know, not really counted on it quite at that point#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, um, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I didn't like it at all.#Statement-non-opinion
I was very uncomfortable.#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
I can imagine.#Appreciation
You know, and, and I mean, it was, I thought a lot,#Statement-non-opinion
sixty dollars interest or something for, for just a couple of months,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm going#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
jeez, that's outrageous,#Other
but in, in, you know, retrospect it wasn't all that much,#Statement-opinion
I mean a lot of people pay a lot more#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, but still, I mean, I figured I didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Think about what you can buy for sixty dollars.#Action-directive
Exactly#Agree/Accept
Groceries for a week.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Repeat-phrase
I, I think about all, all the money that, that we've spent on interest#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on all of our credit cards,#Other
and it's just incredible.#Statement-non-opinion
But now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax?#Yes-No-Question
We've never been able to take it off our income tax.#Dispreferred answers
I'm, I'm fairly newly married.#Statement-non-opinion
I've only been married less than two years#Statement-non-opinion

and before that, I never owned a home or anything,#Statement-non-opinion
so I never had any deductions.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, really, it was always just money#Statement-non-opinion
Thrown away.#Collaborative Completion
thrown away.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
jeez.#Appreciation
And I never really thought about it because,#Statement-non-opinion
You were good at it#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I suspect that, you know, thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and, you know, the amount that I know they buy, I guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation, and, you know, just don't talk about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Most, most people don't like to talk about money.#Statement-opinion
They feel uncomfortable, I think.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
You know,#Statement-opinion
very personal.#Statement-opinion
for a lot of people it is very personal.#Other
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept

and especially if you, if you don't feel you're handling it quite right#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be,#Other
But I think the, the average American is probably pretty heavily in debt. Not, not including like a mortgage.#Statement-opinion
A mortgage is an understandable debt#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because that's, you have, you have to have a roof over your head.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I would much rather own my own home than, than be renting it like we're doing.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, we're basically, you know, kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
We're renting a house.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, you know, right now with the way our credit card situation is, there's nobody in the world that's going to give us a mortgage on a house.#Statement-non-opinion

But, but, once I suppose you, you prove yourself by paying this off next year#Statement-opinion

you'll be in very good shape.#Other

Well, what is your view, do you consider the Soviet Union a threat?#Yes-No-Question
I don't know that it's so much a military threat anymore as a,#Negative non-no answers
well, you know, it's, it's real confusing right now to know what kind of a, of, of a threat it is, I guess,#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, it takes awhile to, to get used to something,#Statement-opinion
you know, if, if they have completely chain-,#Uninterpretable
on the, place has completely turned that much around to where they're not, you know, not what they used to be,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh#Uninterpretable
It's, it's hard to, to know anymore if it's a, a threat one way or another because, uh, it used to be s-, so, f-, much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell, you know, rank and file in behind it.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And now that with Gorbachev is introducing more, I guess, freedoms or expressions of freedom, it doesn't look as though, you know, everybody's following the same pattern.#Statement-opinion

And, those,#Uninterpretable
the people who are, you know, the staunch military conservative people,#Statement-opinion
you never know, well, Gorbachev's future is like whereas,#Statement-opinion

whereas in the past it was seen as, you know, whoever was the head of the, the communist party was seen as, you know, untouchable.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I thi-,#Uninterpretable

the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so, uh, dramatic that you almost think, now wait a minute, you know, we're getting stuck into something here, you know,#Statement-opinion
if,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if somebody's about to, to clobber you, the first thing they do is sort of say, well, you know, we're, we're ashamed, we're not going to do that anymore.#Other
Exactly.#Appreciation
And, uh, um, you know, I'd, I'd like to think that that isn't true#Statement-non-opinion
but I, I,#Uninterpretable
you know, the evidence is that, uh, you know, he's, he's let some, some stuff go, you know, the east German situation.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible,#Statement-opinion
you know, if I'd have been asleep for five years,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and read it in a book, I said, no, no, no, that didn't, couldn't have happened that way.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, it's amazing just because of the drain that's been on, you know, both economies that our economy is, of course, been able to, uh, withstand that a little better,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, the Russian economy#Statement-opinion
they, you know, they,#Uninterpretable
I don't know what the percentages are,#Hedge
but I heard it one time,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And finally, you know, who knows#Uninterpretable
maybe they're finally waking up and saying, you know, we can't afford this.#Statement-opinion
Uh, the U S isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, even if they're saying that beneath the doors.#Other
But it's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period.#Statement-opinion

Even if it is, you know, the best thing in the long run, it just steps on too many people's toes,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
who are comfortable with the way the situation is.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I think, you know, what I'd have to,#Statement-opinion
I, I gues-, I guess to answer the question directly, I'm still just a, a little bit, you know, leery of the whole thing.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What I haven't seen is the, uh, you know, a great stepping back in the military,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
situation.#Other
You know, it's, it's one thing, you know, to let us go ahead and sort of disarm#Statement-opinion
and, you know, I even had a thought once that the whole Iraqi thing might have been just a, a deal to go ahead and let us, uh, you know,#Statement-opinion
Expend?#Collaborative Completion
expend some, some military hardware.#Other
Of course, it didn't turn out that way.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, uh, that, that may have been a, a, a kind of far out way of thinking about it I don't know.#Statement-opinion
Well, it's interesting, anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
philosophy that, that was here in,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, twenty years ago.#Other
Uh, but, of course, the people who have challenged that or tried to do, on-, have cor-, have not been world powers.#Statement-opinion
So, it's easier for us to say, you know, to an Iraq, you know,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, you can't do this, get back, you know, or we're going to force you.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or, or we can do something about it.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Whereas, you know, if the Soviet Union would have, who knows what taking over Mongolia or, or something like that, who is really, will we have been more just rhetoric,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, rather than going in there officially or, you know,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
physically and try to, to remove them.#Other
Well, the, the China situation, you know, the when, it looked like that thing was, was turning around#Statement-opinion
and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the, in the Red Square or wherever said, okay,#Statement-opinion
and that's enough.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the tanks came in and,#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
you know, pretty much took care of that.#Other
And,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, that,#Uninterpretable
personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat,#Statement-opinion
and I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward, you know, just some pretty hard by the socialism,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, you know, the, the reaction, uh,#Uninterpretable
you know, the, the economic,#Uninterpretable
well, the, uh, the social structure of the Soviet Union, you know, it, it's, it's coming apart at the seams.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and I've heard people say, well, you know, it's just like the American Civil War, will there be a union or not?#Statement-non-opinion
Well, no,#Statement-opinion
it's not the same sort of a thing at all because that, the whole Soviet system was put together under total force,#Statement-opinion
you know, there was no,#Uninterpretable
as, as we are seeing now with a lot of those,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
areas wanting out of it,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, they, uh, nobody vo-,#Uninterpretable
you know, a lot#Uninterpretable
man , those people didn't vote to become part of the Soviet Union,#Statement-non-opinion
they had no choice.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that was always kind of interesting,#Statement-opinion
people,#Uninterpretable
you know, a lot of my friends have a taken us down, the stance of, you know, these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, if I'm a Soviet and if part of, you know, south, let's say South Dakota wanted to succ-, you know, succeed, am I going to stand for that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now I realize that the origins are, are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that they may have been forced, I'm not that familiar with their future,#Other
but I, you know, I,#Uninterpretable
it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than, uh, a volunteer or willingness to join.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But,#Uninterpretable
There, there was the whole thing was put together, you know, by force.#Statement-non-opinion
There's, there's no, no real question about that.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And some of the countries that were forced in at th-, later dates is the three Baltic countries, you know, came in, in the forties,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, it's, well, it's not that they came in, it's they were conquered by the Germans,#Statement-non-opinion
And then,#Statement-non-opinion
and then the Russians even,#Collaborative Completion
just never given back.#Other
took it back from the Germans and never bothered to give it back,#Other
Yep.#Agree/Accept
you know,#Other
so. That's a,#Statement-opinion
Well, that whole a,#Uninterpretable
a little different situation.#Other
the whole i-, idea if you look at the Russian history and I guess all countries the way it used to be is, the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers#Statement-opinion
and maybe, you know, more and more people are seeing, oh, countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isn't going to help you,#Statement-opinion
you can,#Uninterpretable
well, I guess like,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with, uh, Israel is a perfect example.#Other
The reason they have the Angolan Heights and the, the, uh, all their buffer area is between Jordan and the, the Sinai and, and Lebanon was just as a buffer#Statement-opinion
but, you know, as you can see with the, the scuds go right over there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's, there's very little that, that binds you anymore in today's technology.#Statement-opinion
I knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany they said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts, all the bombs are going to go right over Germany#Statement-non-opinion
and they're going to land in other places,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know, that's going to be the safest place to be.#Statement-non-opinion
That's probably very true.#Appreciation
Ve-,#Uninterpretable
that's very interesting, never thought of that.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, uh, I, I guess, what they'd have to do to,#Statement-non-opinion
I really don't know,#Hedge
you know, in, in the, in, you know, I hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, some reason or other, you know, is, uh, it's kind of a strange thing we've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say,#Statement-opinion
Nobody knows what to do.#Statement-opinion
whoa, wait a minute,#Other
you know. What's, uh,#Rhetorical-Questions
Is it real?#Backchannel in question form
what's, what's really happening here.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But you wonder how, well, this thing,#Statement-opinion
w-, who, was it Boris Yeltsin, the guy that's running the, uh, or evidently was elected president of the Soviet,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for the Russian republic,#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
which is, I guess, the, uh, the biggest,#Other
I get confused between all the, which is the Soviet provinces versus which are the, the Russian provinces,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
versus what are,#Other
Well, in the center#Statement-non-opinion
but you got a, the, the great big area that's just, was traditionally known as Russia#Statement-non-opinion
and then all these little nationality groups,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
around it, you know, that were, you know, was there nineteen of them or, or whatever,#Other
you know, and these were all the Soviet economists, us you know, they had some real fancy names for them.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Matter of fact when the,#Uninterpretable
uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what I read when the, uh, lee-, uh, United Nations was setup in, in San Francisco, one of the first things the Russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the, uh, of these, you know, republics,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, as a,#Collaborative Completion
as a separate country,#Other
you know,#Statement-non-opinion
as a vote.#Collaborative Completion
so there would be, there would be nineteen,#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
rather than one.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the United States said, well, that mean we get to bring in forty-eight, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And, uh, that sort of,#Uninterpretable
you know, they backed down on that.#Statement-non-opinion
Died down on that.#Collaborative Completion
I thought it was interesting that recently here the Warsaw Pact no longer exists as a militor-, military force,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's merely an economic now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, wonder if that#Uninterpretable
Well, I mean at ,#Uninterpretable
wh-, uh, w-,#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
exactly.#Agree/Accept
what do you get shot by something that's called a, an economic force or what is called a military pact,#Other
you know, it's all,#Uninterpretable
you can change the name of something#Statement-non-opinion
but I wonder if it's still, exists.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Although, I've seen some evidence that, you know, the, uh, the Russian soldiers are,#Statement-non-opinion
well, you,#Uninterpretable
the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because there's, they're having housing shortages now.#Statement-opinion
What do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by, uh, Bulgaria and,#Rhetorical-Questions
Exactly#Agree/Accept
and, and all the,#Uninterpretable
and Czechoslovakia#Other
and now all of a sudden they're going home#Statement-non-opinion
and somebody's got to pay for their,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's what they're saying the whole problem, you know, with, if we were to demilitarize Europe,#Statement-non-opinion
what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there?#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, that's not,#Uninterpretable
What's going to happen to the economies that are no longer have a, a million plus people in the indu-, you know,#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in each country from the U S ...#Other

Um, all right.#Other
I've, uh,#Uninterpretable
as far as I'm concerned, I find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating,#Statement-opinion
and I think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Oh, well, I tend, I tend to agree.#Agree/Accept
Uh, in some ways I think it's, uh, I think if anything, a lot of, um, the changes that have occurred, uh,#Statement-opinion
in some ways they're for the better#Statement-opinion
because I think women should have a choice,#Statement-opinion
and I do believe in the, being able to have a choice as to, as far as, what you would like to do with your life.#Statement-opinion
But by the same token, and I know this for myself because I've worked and I've not worked, um,#Statement-non-opinion
that it makes it, uh, sometimes it makes life more difficult.#Statement-opinion
I think when the roles now are less defined, as far as, you know, what, uh, women should or should not be doing, that it, it, it could make life more difficult.#Statement-opinion
There are more things to work out.#Statement-opinion
I know when I was working, you know, you have all these problems with, with the child care and, and with, uh, pleasing, you know, your boss on the job,#Statement-opinion
so you have added stresses from there#Statement-opinion
and then you still have all the things that, um, that you need to do at home#Statement-opinion
and that doesn't change, you know,#Statement-opinion
just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't, uh, make those other things go away#Statement-opinion
and the other responsibilities are still important.#Statement-opinion
Um,#Uninterpretable
so, um, have you, have you worked outside, also and, um, feel that, it, that,#Yes-No-Question
well, how do you feel, as far as, uh,#Open-Question
what would be a happy medium#Wh-Question
or, or what would you like to see?#Open-Question
I would like, uh,#Statement-opinion
yes,#Yes answers
I have worked outside of the home#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was in one of those safe occupations.#Other
I was a school teacher,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we had one child when I taught for my two year career.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, we,#Uninterpretable
uh, then I stopped teaching after my husband's bus-, business was established,#Statement-non-opinion
and we had two children#Statement-non-opinion
and I stayed home with those children,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and raised those children#Other
and now that my husband has retired, I am back substitute teaching,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which if anyone has ever been involved in that, some days it's fun#Statement-opinion
and some days you wonder why you're even bothering,#Statement-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because your fighting for your life.#Statement-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I am a fighter#Statement-non-opinion
and I've always been a disciplinarian.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I'm, I'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply.#Statement-opinion
I think they're going in by choice.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I think so.#Agree/Accept
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Yes.#Repeat-phrase
And, and I have no problem with that,#Statement-opinion
but I think the male needs to be the dominant person.#Statement-opinion
And I think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand, uh,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
are not letting that happen.#Other
They are very aggressive.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They're, uh, they almost have what I would call a killer e-, killer bee instinct.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they have to be in charge.#Statement-opinion
And,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I th-, I think they lose a lot by what I call neutering their husbands.#Other
Well, what do you think,#Wh-Question
though, um, um,#Uninterpretable
I don't know.#Hedge
I,#Uninterpretable
the, the one problem I guess I have,#Statement-opinion
and maybe what so many women, younger women now are choosing to go outside is,#Statement-opinion
I feel that in general, in this society, that being at home is not looked upon as, um, a job in itself.#Statement-opinion
Whereas, you know, you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself,#Statement-non-opinion
but I know when I was working,#Statement-non-opinion
and I was a-, an engineer so I was always with men,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, and they were single, many of them,#Statement-non-opinion
and I tried to explain to them, well, my day doesn't end when I leave at,#Statement-non-opinion
I used to leave at three,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I keep going to eleven at night#Other
and they had, they used to look down on women that were home,#Statement-non-opinion
they'd say, oh, I bet you go home and,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, at least you get out of here at three#Quotation
and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas,#Quotation
Oh, sure#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I used to be infuriated,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because they really had no idea what was involved once I got home.#Statement-non-opinion
Now taking care of them, running them everywhere, helping with homework, the bath, the whole, you know, everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, and I think that one reason that so many younger women feel im-, i-, compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected,#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that being home is not a respectable, uh, position in society.#Other
And, there's a lot of truth to that#Statement-opinion
and I don't know how you feel.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got,#Statement-non-opinion
but I can see with the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home.#Statement-opinion
And yet by the same token, I think some of it is jealousy,#Statement-opinion
you, you,#Uninterpretable
once in a while, you hear them say things like, I wish I had the choice,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
I wish I was the one,#Quotation
I would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us,#Quotation
If my wife had an education and could support us,#Collaborative Completion
and the only value I see coming out of,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this is that children now in, in a two parent home, they now actually have two parents,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I see my sons-in-law,#Statement-non-opinion
I have a daughter who's a nurse#Statement-non-opinion
and I have a daughter,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
who's a beautician.#Other
And I see,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
my sons-in-law cooking and,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
dropping children off at the sitter and,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
picking children up from school and,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and having a much better relationship with their children,#Other
That's true.#Statement-opinion
than my husband ever did#Other
because he,#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Statement-opinion
left home at five thirty in the morning,#Other
and he got home at six fifteen.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, he ate his dinner#Statement-non-opinion
and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, now the young fathers are having a chance to parent,#Statement-opinion
and I think,#Statement-opinion
And they enjoy it.#Collaborative Completion
that's an advantage.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
And they do enjoy it.#Statement-opinion
I,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I see,#Other
you're right.#Agree/Accept
I see many more men in the supermarket,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the parks with their children,#Other
and I think that is healthy because ch-,#Statement-opinion
And I think it's a, a wonderful advantage for the young, for the, for the, particularly for the males, for the little boys to have,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
a relationship with their father,#Other
and, and I don't,#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
think you, we get into so much of the mother dominating figure, if, if the father has more input there.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads,#Statement-opinion
and they have to,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that kind of job, uh, to go out there and shovel that tar and, and drive those big trucks.#Other
And we just recently finished a long drive through the west, a little over five thousand miles,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and at one point we sat down, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't realize it,#Statement-non-opinion
but I sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And here's this young girl with the tattoos#Statement-non-opinion
and she w-, has just, had just driven a load of meat from Minneapolis to some place in Arizona,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and she'd been,#Statement-non-opinion
and I ask her how old she was#Statement-non-opinion
and she was the ag-, between the age of our daughters#Statement-non-opinion
and she had been driving,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a truck for seven years.#Other
And I thought, gosh,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life-style when,#Other
I guess I'm s-, I'm a-, maybe Victorian#Statement-opinion
and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist,#Statement-opinion
in that,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
he's a very considerate person,#Other
but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and, and in the home,#Statement-non-opinion
and she should vote,#Statement-non-opinion
but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, boy#Appreciation
Now it probably doesn't work that way in our household because I have strong opinions about things,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
too,#Other
but, uh, I like being taken care of.#Statement-non-opinion
I like my luggage,#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Hedge
carried and, my door opened,#Other
and I think the young women are losing that#Statement-opinion
and I think that's sad.#Statement-opinion
well, that, that's true.#Agree/Accept
There is that part, too,#Statement-opinion
and I guess we also have to examine though#Statement-opinion
and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as, you know, anybody else,#Statement-opinion
He was raised in the south,#Statement-non-opinion
um,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's a little war condition,#Statement-opinion
I guess ha-,#Uninterpretable
both.#Uninterpretable
Oh, oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and you have to, I guess you have to question too, why a lot of the men, especially, I think middle age and older men, why they feel that way#Statement-opinion
and, and I think it gets scary for them to see change, also.#Statement-opinion
They've been used to being, really to be honest, in, in society, and in a way, number one,#Statement-opinion
and they come home#Statement-non-opinion
and everything's done for them.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And their meal is served#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching.#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Agree/Accept
And I think, I think this reaction comes more out of fear.#Statement-opinion
Now, my husband is, um, he's ten years older than me,#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
but he has, his attitudes are very much pro-women, pro-career, which is kind of interesting.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He comes from a culture where women are, stay at home and do everything,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, and yet, um, he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility, um, if that meant, you know, for me to be able to, uh, uh, advance or go back to work or whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm kind of more,#Statement-non-opinion
thank you,#3rd-party-talk
I'm kind of more middle of the road.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that when children are small, I think it's okay for women to work especially,#Statement-opinion
there should be some, a lot more part time,#Statement-opinion
but I think it's, um,#Statement-opinion
I don't believe in this career, you know, this career drive when, when they're small, because I think,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're downstairs Aaron,#3rd-party-talk
I think that's very, um, unfair to, to children,#Statement-opinion
like, uh, engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I refused to work more than thirty.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was part-time#Statement-non-opinion
and even that was a rat race,#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I think you have to put in perspective, that, you know, when the kids came home from school, I wanted to be here.#Statement-opinion
I didn't want, I don't want a job where I'm traveling around and an-, I'm away and, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
so I think you can have both.#Statement-opinion
It's more hectic,#Statement-opinion
but I think you have to put into perspective what your kids need,#Statement-opinion
I think a lot of,#Statement-opinion
first then#Other
my problem with the young mothers i-, ...#Other

Hi,#Conventional-opening
my last, uh, auto repair was my, my, uh, alternator went out.#Statement-non-opinion
I have a nineteen eighty-six Toyota, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it's a little Tercel#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I have a fri-, a friend who's real good with, uh, repairing cars#Statement-non-opinion
so I got him to take the alternator off and take it and, uh, you know, get a replacement part.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So we went to a, uh, a, a place called Quality Auto Parts#Statement-non-opinion
an, and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and, and everything#Statement-non-opinion
and they're, they're, uh, very reasonable.#Statement-opinion
So, uh, I bought the alternator,#Statement-non-opinion
we p-, put it on the car#Statement-non-opinion
and it, it didn't work,#Statement-non-opinion
and it blew out all the fuses.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How much was the alternator?#Wh-Question
Uh, I bel-, something like sixty-nine dollars, som-, something on that order.#Statement-non-opinion
Did he, did he hook up the wir-, wiring wrong?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
he hooked it up right.#Statement-non-opinion
It, it was just that the, the part just, just didn't fit the car,#Statement-non-opinion
so. I took it back#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, he, he took the alter-, the guy in, in the parts shop took the alternator#Statement-non-opinion
and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator#Statement-non-opinion
so we, we went back and tried it again, put it on again#Statement-non-opinion
and it still didn't work,#Statement-non-opinion
and we took the car up to, um, a little place called Pep Boys,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if you have them in your area#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
but, uh, they're, they're pretty reasonable, uh, car repair place also.#Statement-opinion
So, uh, took it up there, towed it up there because it, you know, wouldn't start or anything#Statement-non-opinion
and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and, uh, took them about an, an hour to, um, figure out what was, what was blowing the fuse,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was, it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse.#Statement-non-opinion
Anyway, ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer#Statement-non-opinion
and the only problem was that, uh, it had to be a genuine Toyota, uh, alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it, that, that, you know, they sit in there and everything#Statement-non-opinion
but there's just some little difference that, um, causes it not to work an i-,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they probably built that in so they could make money.#Statement-opinion
Ye-, yeah,#Agree/Accept
I guess so#Agree/Accept
and that was my, that was my last experience.#Statement-non-opinion
Well I had a weird,#Statement-non-opinion
there's a little sensing device, uh, in front of my, uh, um, I'm not sure, right in front of the f-, fan,#Statement-non-opinion
it's a, it's an air conditioner sensing device.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know why,#Statement-non-opinion
it actually,#Statement-non-opinion
there's a metal piece that fits through the belts, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and somehow that broke off#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I, I still can't figure out how it broke,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, anyway, so a-, this piece obviously, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I have a Subaru,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I think you can only get it through Subaru dealer, etcetera,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks#Statement-non-opinion
Goodness,#Appreciation
are you able,#Uninterpretable
And, and I haven't had too many problems with my car,#Statement-non-opinion
I got a eighty-eight Subaru, G L X T#Statement-non-opinion
and it,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, and then, you know just basic maintenance and oil changes#Statement-non-opinion
an I, and I do not do my oil changes#Statement-non-opinion
and I will not do my oil changes.#Statement-non-opinion
I've, I think the first time I tried to do one and ended up, um, trying to ge-, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
yo-, borrowed somebody else's jack#Statement-non-opinion
and I did this#Statement-non-opinion
and I went and bought everything,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so after buying the filter and all the oil, you're looking at ten bucks at least,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or somewhere in there an, and, uh, and then to go to the trouble, that I figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that, that's, um, you know,#Uninterpretable
as far as any maintenance on my car, I, I shy away from the oil changes,#Statement-non-opinion
that's for sure.#Appreciation
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well my car is, uh, it's an eighty-six#Statement-non-opinion
and I really hadn't had any, any trouble with it un-, until that#Statement-non-opinion
and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, and this was just recent,#Statement-non-opinion
so I really can't complain about this one.#Statement-non-opinion
How did you put that many miles on it, in,#Wh-Question
Um, well, I used,#Statement-non-opinion
four or five years?#Other
I used to work, uh,#Other
it was a seventy mile trip everyday, you know, two ways was seventy miles.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, a hundred and forty mile trip?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
it was, it was just seventy miles.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, thirty-five miles each way.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Repeat-phrase
And, uh, I did that for about three years#Statement-non-opinion
and it really, it really added up.#Statement-non-opinion
I've only taken, uh, maybe two trips that were about four hours long dow-, uh, down to Shreveport.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, the rest of it was, you know, it's just basically driving a long ways to work.#Statement-non-opinion
And now I drive like twenty, twenty-three miles each way,#Statement-non-opinion
so, I'm getting a little, a little, uh, little relief,#Statement-non-opinion
but still I drive a long ways.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I guess because they're highway miles, you know, it's not so bad on your car as, as if it, you know, were just regular street, you know.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you work for T I?#Yes-No-Question
Yes#Yes answers
I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement

I was going to ask you, you know, as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now, um,#Wh-Question
I don't work for T I#Negative non-no answers

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I just wondering how I go about getting the cash#Declarative Wh-Question
Uh, there's a number that you call,#Statement-non-opinion
it's the same number that you, that you call to make a call.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
You, you call that number#Action-directive
and, and, uh, somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message#Statement-non-opinion
and you can leave a message.#Action-directive
Okay.#Agree/Accept
I know someone that did that,#Statement-non-opinion
you leave a message#Action-directive
and they'll, they'll call you back.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Agree/Accept
all right,#Agree/Accept
well that's good to know.#Appreciation
I haven't been doing#Statement-non-opinion
th-, this is the first time I've been called in a long time#Statement-non-opinion
and I haven't been doing it#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Oh really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I've done it maybe twelve times.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I don't know if I've done it quite that much,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, mine is mixed up too,#Statement-non-opinion
I have to call and get it fixed#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, let's see before I had this car I had a, um, I bought an Audi five thousand#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I bought it, I bought it used.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I just bought it from a friend who was going to, who just charged me what the dealer was going to give, give him for it for a trade-in,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it had a whole lot of miles on it.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I figured maybe I'd get one or two years out of it,#Statement-non-opinion
an I, an I did get a couple of good years out of it#Statement-non-opinion
and the, uh, the engine messed up on me#Statement-non-opinion
and then I gave it to a guy to repair who works for the aut-, for the Audi dealer#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, he took the engine apart#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, he just said he couldn't fix it#Statement-non-opinion
so the engine never got put back together again.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh, oh well.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
I was driving a sixty-six Plymouth Fury.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
I think those old cars#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and,#Statement-opinion
might, might be a pretty good bet because you#Other
I don't know, i-,#Hedge
Oh, tha-, that's when they made cars, though,#Other
this things was, the body was in good condition#Statement-non-opinion
and you know, it ran fine.#Statement-non-opinion
It was starting to burn some oil.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, but I had to you know, ge-,#Uninterpretable
you know, I, after about thr-, couple of months after I was out of college I finally splurged and bought my car#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Other
I read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy-four.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well, you know, these, these cars made in the sixties and stuff,#Statement-opinion
I mean the steel, I mean, the thickness,#Statement-opinion
I mean, i-, those thin-, they're just, th-,#Statement-opinion
you just don't see cars like that.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they last a long time.#Statement-opinion
And they were simple too,#Statement-opinion
the engines were simple and durable#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
some people will still buy them, you know,#Other
they'll,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's easy to, it's easy, I guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars, engines and transmissions#Statement-opinion
and if you, I guess if you keep trad-, changing them out you can keep a car for a long time.#Statement-opinion
Course I guess I could do the same thing with the, the Toyota that I have,#Statement-opinion
I just don't know how much they'll want to charge me to,#Statement-non-opinion
It almost costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it,#Statement-opinion
you're just better off buying another car.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I guess so,#Agree/Accept
but I just think they cost too much in the, in the first place, now a days.#Statement-opinion

Yes.#Other
Um I guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years despite, our total tax burden, despite tax cuts#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in, in the world,#Statement-opinion
and in#Uninterpretable
of the matter,#Uninterpretable
you get what you pay for,#Statement-opinion
if we're going to have national health insurance, which seems likely, it's necessarily going to involve more taxes.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I suspect, I take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the, the economy, that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes, uh, energy taxes, particularly, and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes, that's the direction we should look.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Well, I guess I kind of have mixed feelings#Statement-non-opinion
Um, you know, you always sit there#Statement-opinion
and out of each pay check so much comes out of it,#Statement-opinion
and you wonder, you know, where's it all going#Statement-opinion
Where's it all going?#Agree/Accept
and we have such a huge, uh, national deficit,#Statement-opinion
and, and I guess a lot of times there's questions wondering well, if it's doing a whole lot of good.#Statement-opinion
I know there's a lot of social programs out there that need help.#Statement-opinion
But you kind of always wonder, well where's, where's the money going?#Statement-opinion
Well, one, one, one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which in principle is going into, into a big trust fund,#Other
but that is a particularly regressive tax, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it's a tax on the first dollar earnings,#Statement-non-opinion
and Senator Moynihan's, uh, proposal to, to, to cut there I think wou-, makes a lot of sense.#Statement-opinion
I'm sorry,#Reject
I couldn't.#Reject
I think Senator Moynihan's proposal to, to cut the social security tax which isn't really going to, going to beef up, up, up the social security program could make a lot of sense.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree with that.#Agree/Accept
As far as other countries, I'm not, um, I don't keep up on it too much as to far as what, you know, as what they're do-.#Statement-non-opinion
I know#Uninterpretable
we were in Ireland last year#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I know that the tax there is extremely high, much higher than we pay here,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but as far as other countries, I'm not, uh, up to par on#Other
I think Japan, I think Japan is probably about equal to ours#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and other major countries are higher.#Statement-non-opinion
Our friends were amazed that the sales taxes, the cost of things when they went to Canada not so long ago.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, as a whole, most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services,#Statement-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's a real, real,#Other
they're, they're real trade-offs there.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but, and, and you sit there and wonder, um,#Statement-opinion
I guess this doesn't really have to do with taxes but just money in general, and, and, um, wondering if you're going to have enough when you retire to live on.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I,#Uninterpretable
that's, that's a scary thing that there's no, no real knowing about.#Statement-opinion
Uh, the, the there's a lot of inflation risk that isn't taken care of in most private pension plans.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
But, um, are you involved with the legislature up there,#Yes-No-Question
or which,#Uninterpretable
No,#No answers
I'm at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, part of the Commerce Department.#Other
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Here in Gaithersburg, Maryland.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was just wondering since you said Washington D C,#Statement-non-opinion
and you, and you picked this topic,#Statement-non-opinion
I was just#Statement-non-opinion
Well, well#Uninterpretable
kind of curious.#Other
I, I, I didn't pick it, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you didn't.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, um, I, like I don't really recall.#Statement-non-opinion
I may have filled out on the, on the form,#Statement-non-opinion
but I, I certainly, certainly have the feeling I've been given topics different from the ones that I mentioned before.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, did you.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
See, I haven't placed any calls.#Statement-non-opinion
Did they automatically assign the topic?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
yes,#Yes answers
when you place a call#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I didn't#Statement-non-opinion
topic is given to you.#Other
know that.#Other
I thought whoever made the call could choose what topic,#Statement-non-opinion
because I haven't made any calls yet.#Statement-non-opinion
I've just received some.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you should try it.#Action-directive
Oh, I didn't realize that#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
because it's kind of a, it can be a rather controversial subject depend on who you're talking to.#Statement-opinion
Uh, many of the subjects are. Uh, taxes, taxes especially.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, one thing that has kept our tax burden high, and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the, is the level of def-, of the defense budget#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
and that's, that same subject,#Uninterpretable

Hi.#Conventional-opening
How are you doing?#Conventional-opening
What,#Signal-non-understanding
I couldn't hear you?#Statement-non-opinion
I said, how are you doing?#Conventional-opening
I'm doing fine.#Conventional-opening
I'm, uh, just editing a spreadsheet right now.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm trying to figure out how I can retire without having to work until I'm ninety-five.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We've been doing that too#Statement-non-opinion
We're trying to retire in our fifties.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
This is a very appropriate topic for our, uh, conversation today because what I'm figuring out is that I'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what I'm making#Statement-non-opinion
Good luck on that one, then.#Other
What is that?#Signal-non-understanding
I said good luck on that one, then.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, we've got a pretty good situation, my wife and I, since our property is already paid for.#Statement-opinion
You know, the main things that I like about the uh, the job benefits#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
would be the, uh, the availability of the health insurance and the availability of, uh, you know, being able to transfer around, inside the organization without having, you know, when they cut off a system and they don't just can everybody that is working on it, like some companies I know of.#Other
You know, they give you an opportunity to either transfer into an on going, on going project.#Statement-non-opinion
So you work for it T I then#Declarative Yes-No-Question
You can't say?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Yeah.#Repeat-phrase
What?#Signal-non-understanding
Yes,#Yes answers
you do.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I work for D I S D#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't know what your talking about when you say health insurance,#Statement-non-opinion
but Dallas doesn't pay.#Statement-non-opinion
It pays most of mine, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
now, after you work I think five years, they begin to pay most of it.#Statement-non-opinion
But then, for the, the family, you know, I put my kids on my policy.#Statement-non-opinion
It's like two hundred dollars#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's gone up quite a bit#Statement-non-opinion
and they predict, you know, of course, it's going to keep going up.#Statement-non-opinion
I wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage, at some point.#Statement-non-opinion
And benefits, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I'd like to see child care paid for or on-site child care sometime.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that would be a ,#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it would make women go to work sometime if they knew their kids were being taken care of.#Statement-opinion
They could go visit them during the day.#Statement-non-opinion
What?#Tag-Question
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's uh, something I hadn't really thought about because we don't have children.#Statement-non-opinion
But, I can see how it would be a a real benefit.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes#Yes answers
I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, we keep a shelter, also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, go on and pay a lump sum#Statement-non-opinion
and as long as you pay that amount you're okay.#Statement-non-opinion
But if you paid in more than you actually used, and the same thing for insurance, what you predict your going to be paying for insurance, as long as you pay, actually pay out that amount of money, you're okay.#Statement-non-opinion
But if you pay out less, then you lose that money.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
I don't like that part,#Statement-non-opinion
but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that could be, I could see where that would be important.#Statement-non-opinion
And then we got that cafeteria plan,#Statement-non-opinion
do you have that?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
No.#Repeat-phrase
I don't know what it's about .#Statement-non-opinion
You can, uh,#Uninterpretable
well you,#Uninterpretable
let's see, it, it shelters you're money that you pay for, for insurance.#Statement-non-opinion
It takes it out of your salary before taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah#Yes answers
we got that.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Pretax insurance?#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Repeat-phrase
But we call it the cafeteria plan,#Statement-non-opinion
I wonder why.#Statement-non-opinion
Um?#Signal-non-understanding
I said, I wonder why.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, it's probably what the first guy who did it, called it.#Statement-opinion
Cafeteria?#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it#Statement-opinion
Maybe#Maybe/Accept-part
so. Let's see what else can we do?#Open-Question
Changes,#Uninterpretable
I'll tell you what we could do.#Statement-non-opinion
What?#Wh-Question
We could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money. You know, do a little bit better research on who gets hired#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because you know,#Uninterpretable
You mean, like for health insurance?#Summarize/reformulate
Well, not only just health insurance, I mean for the whole benefit of the company.#Maybe/Accept-part
See, I look at it this way. If the company folds, I got to go find a job.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now, if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs, just about anybody in the company, and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job, then we should find (A) a place to put them or (B) you know, boot them out.#Statement-opinion
Well, that's easier done in a company than it is in, uh, school teaching.#Statement-opinion
Well, frankly, I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid.#Statement-opinion
Thank you#Appreciation
What?#Signal-non-understanding
I said, thank you.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We're both school teachers.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I'm, I'm,#Uninterpretable
But it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good.#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Statement-non-opinion
It's almost impossible.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, there's two schools of thought on that.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I, I'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a a professor#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I got about eight years of education ahead of me before I can do that#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
but, once you get that job with the university, you've got ten years of probation.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Then you have tenure.#Statement-non-opinion
And they can't fire you.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you know, in a situation like that, I don't know if that's good or bad.#Statement-non-opinion
I do know that I've had tenured professors that were just sorry.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they did away with tenure in teaching along time ago, you know, in the public schools.#Statement-non-opinion
But in addition.#Uninterpretable
It makes you more at ease.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, you knew you weren't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they, they really can't fire you without cause,#Statement-non-opinion
you know the governments taken care of that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, what I'm looking at is, you know, there are a lot of teachers that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid,#Statement-opinion
and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and I could see a point protecting someone's position,#Statement-non-opinion
but, on the other hand, I don't think it, you know, that someone that teaches, uh, say shop, for instance, should have to have degree at all.#Statement-opinion
Well they don't.#Statement-non-opinion
Well.#Uninterpretable
In some places they don't.#Statement-non-opinion
In some places that don't.#Statement-non-opinion
Do they?#Yes-No-Question
But, you know, you, you get specialized education now, for instance, take computer science.#Statement-non-opinion
We've got kids twenty years old, right now, that could beat any computer professor at micro computer applications.#Statement-opinion
I know we could.#Statement-opinion
And these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches, because there's no comprehensive test that they can take, that would allow them to, to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, I went to college late on in life#Statement-non-opinion
and I realize that hey, it's nothing but four years of endurance#Statement-non-opinion
and you might be teachable,#Statement-non-opinion
you know what I mean?#Tag-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
I mean, my agree is absolutely worthless. *#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
It's my experience and, and my knowledge that, that is beneficial,#Statement-opinion
but then, you know, like I said, I came in backwards.#Statement-non-opinion
What did you get your degree at?#Wh-Question
Industrial Marketing.#Statement-non-opinion
And what's your job now?#Wh-Question
Well, actually I'm selling computer software.#Statement-non-opinion
But, the two are mutually exclusive. Because, the, the experience that got me the job that I got now, was my experience in the construction field, prior to going to college#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
not my degree, which is I think kind of bizarre.#Other
Maybe.#Maybe/Accept-part
All right,#Uninterpretable
what else could we change?#Open-Question
Oh, I'd like to see flexible hours. And teaching,#Statement-non-opinion
Well uh,#Statement-non-opinion
shared, job sharing,#Other
We've,#Other
more of that.#Other
we've, we've already got that.#Other
Well, see, we've got a little bit of it, but not much.#Statement-non-opinion
It would be nice if you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing.#Statement-opinion
What else.#Self-talk
I'd like to be able to, to evaluate your boss#Statement-non-opinion
and it really carry some weight,#Statement-non-opinion
and you get to choose your boss.#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Supervisor evaluations have always been a tough one. Especially in my line, because, you know, my supervisor has nothing to with my job, except to make sure I get my check.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Well, so you get to evaluate him though?#Yes-No-Question
Well, not really.#Negative non-no answers
You know, I mean, there's, what's to evaluate about him, you know,#Rhetorical-Questions
I mean, my, my, supervisor level is like practically zero.#Statement-non-opinion
I run the whole show.#Statement-non-opinion
And when I need something, I tell my boss#Statement-non-opinion
and he gets it for me, because he knows, that I know, what I'm doing.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and uh, that, that is something that I think needs to be expanded on, specially in the large market place. You know, the major corporation, because so often, you know, you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so to speak.#Other
You know, it's, it's hard for me to, you know, especially since I'm in marketing sales, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I make more than my boss. Because he's salary and I'm not.#Statement-non-opinion
I make as much as I earn.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, if I don't make a sale, I don't make anything#Statement-non-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well it's tough,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, you know, there are requirements, and quotas, what not, for me to make,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, the bottom line on, on that kind of thing is, you know, we have a lot of people, especially in major corporations, who aren't doing a damn thing.#Statement-opinion
They're just there.#Statement-opinion
You know, the work they do could be totally eliminated,#Statement-opinion
and not that they aren't worth or not that they aren't trying or anything. But, it's just that their jobs are useless.#Statement-opinion
Take, for instance, um, a large construction company I used to work for. Ed Swampers.#Action-directive
Swampers is a guy, who's in the union.#Statement-non-opinion
He's a laborer.#Statement-non-opinion
And he's assigned to,#Statement-non-opinion

Well, the first thing for me is I wonder, I see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is, um, if privacy is something that disturbs your private state, I mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state,#Statement-opinion
that's one thing,#Statement-opinion
and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it, in other words, finds something out about you that's another.#Statement-opinion
And the first kind of invasion of, the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me, and very much everyday in this country,#Statement-opinion
but in the second time, at least overtly, uh, where someone comes in and, uh, finds out information about you that should be private, uh, does not seem, uh, um, obviously, everyday.#Statement-opinion
I, I think I agree with that.#Agree/Accept
I think in a good example on the typical thing that happens, uh, when the phone rang#Statement-opinion
and it's T I calling,#Statement-non-opinion
my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message#Statement-non-opinion
and then I realize, oh, no, this is something I solicited,#Statement-non-opinion
That's right#Agree/Accept
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion#Statement-non-opinion
but after that I realized, no, I, I really wanted this#Statement-non-opinion
and it was sort of exciting#Statement-non-opinion
and so,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that was almost an example of s-, an invasion that turns out to be not invasive.#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
it turned out to be, uh, uh, an invitation.#Summarize/reformulate
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Uh, and at the same time I think that I receive on, on the order of, uh, probably, seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it.#Statement-non-opinion
From, from personal parties or from these, um, phone answer, phone, uh,#Or-Clause
Commercial,#Statement-non-opinion
commercial things.#Other
sol-, solicitations primarily.#Other
Oh, that, that's a remarkable number.#Appreciation
I get them rarely#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm still astounded that, that one, they let anyone do them and two, that they have any effect in this whatsoever#Statement-non-opinion
Um, because I'm usually so insulted by them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they are.#Other
I think they prey on people's, um, inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine.#Statement-opinion
I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say,#Statement-opinion
and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there.#Statement-opinion
And I think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control#Statement-opinion
and you, one's feeling obligated,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because of some sense of, of the way the ritual is played out.#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
And, and, uh, that, that then ends up being the, the most common example for me.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I guess I'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second, this one that you raised.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I don't think I would have thought about that.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that's a good idea on your part.#Statement-opinion
I don't typically feel intruded on, on the things, uh, the sense of finding out information.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known,#Statement-non-opinion
and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I A conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge.#Statement-opinion
So there's, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it,#Statement-opinion
and I can't talk about the second one other than to, to, to generate paranoia#Statement-opinion
It's a surmise#Statement-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
To, to surmise. It is there.#Statement-opinion
I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country.#Other
I don't think I'd like the K G B is monitoring my phone or anything like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I guess, although, I, well, that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because, uh, if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest#Other
and I'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh,#Statement-opinion
uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it, well, then I guess one could assume one was invaded#Other
but I don't feel invaded by it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't,#Statement-non-opinion
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things,#Other
I'm not sure why.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts#Statement-opinion
and if someone finds out something about me that is true, I, I don't have a sense of loss from that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you must have a relatively clean conscience then#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Um, the, the other side of that might be if, if someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes,#Agree/Accept
ev-, more harmed or something.#Statement-opinion
Bec-,#Uninterpretable
right,#Agree/Accept
because,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you don't have anyway to turn it off.#Other
Tho-,#Uninterpretable
did you hear about this Lotus data base that was being put together?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
I did.#Statement-non-opinion
I was just about to write a letter when I heard they canceled it.#Statement-non-opinion
That would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because I would find that there be, cou-, a good possibly that their facts were, were fantasy.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from a, that I would rather they didn't#Statement-non-opinion
and that might be the sense of the spending pattern, for instance,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, that I would have thought to be private.#Other
But then if it turns out to generate incorrect things, that's even worse#Statement-opinion
so,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
or if my call rate of, of eight t-, or so a week went up even higher because#Other
.#Non-verbal
uh, someone had, had,#Other
They had you pegged#Collaborative Completion
Right.#Agree/Accept
And the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money#Statement-opinion
and then all of,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a sudden you get your thirty a week because now,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're advertising you.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, one of the problems with the Lotus data base was, um, that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, they said they would give it out to only select companies#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, you know, just like software is only given out to customers,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you can't believe that.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Right.#Agree/Accept
It would, it would be pirated#Statement-opinion
and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering, you know, full cash price,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for it.#Other
I mean, you know, you can't tell it, what a company really has to do with it#Statement-opinion
and there's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone, any hacker being able to know what your income is, what your spending habits are,#Statement-opinion
and, you know, and, and that hacker just has to get in to, in touch with the sneak thief#Statement-opinion
and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
And I guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
threatened as a result of, of it#Other
so,#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
maybe that is a, a little bit of what privacy is.#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
I also thought about it, was of, uh, waiting to talk to you that, another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how to behave such that there isn't.#Statement-non-opinion
But I realized I have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy.#Statement-opinion
If I deviate from social norms of behavior, if I run up and down the street yelling or something, someone's going to invade my privacy very quickly.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I realize that that, I mean, I can take that for granted#Statement-non-opinion
but I used to, I used to live in India#Statement-non-opinion
and things are quite different there in terms of that.#Statement-non-opinion
There's less of a sense of privacy.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, it's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy,#Statement-non-opinion
certainly the language I know doesn't,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's interesting.#Appreciation
but just says a word for loneliness.#Other
Loneliness is the closest you can come, which is really quite different.#Statement-non-opinion
But, but no concept for wanting to be private.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's, it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state, at least officially.#Statement-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, so there's not,#Uninterpretable
I mean, doors don't have latches on them.#Statement-non-opinion
People don't tend to knock,#Statement-non-opinion
you just,#Uninterpretable
if there's a door closed and you open it because it's in your way#Statement-non-opinion
you, people walk in out#Statement-non-opinion
and, as a, as a westerner in India, and I was often surprised,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That, that would be,#Statement-opinion
and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded.#Other
That would be culturally shocking#Other
You know, it very much is.#Agree/Accept
But on the other hand, I realized I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and people would leave,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
me alone.#Other
Whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much, if you go out and then act like the lunatic you, you violate the, uh, the norms of social, of, um, public behavior.#Statement-opinion
Um, people start paying attention to you very much#Statement-opinion
and they start asking questions and in the sense are invite-, invade, invading your privacy although, if you know what the social norms are, you know, quote unquote, you asked for it.#Statement-opinion
But it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And which isn't of, always the case in all cultures,#Statement-opinion
and it wasn't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized that's actually something that's culturally relative.#Statement-non-opinion
Tha-, that is true.#Agree/Accept
I haven't thought about that#Statement-non-opinion
and, and that it's fascinating to, to think a lot of someone who doesn't know how to say private.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
And that's really, um,#Uninterpretable
well, I mean, I, I wonder how people have sex,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and things like that,#Other
I mean, they a-,#Uninterpretable
you go to India#Statement-non-opinion
and it's obvious, you know, the results of sex are quite obvious, as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, but I, I just don't quite, um,#Uninterpretable
there's hope, I actually for al-,#Uninterpretable
of the time I've spent there, I still don't quite understand how certain things that I assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because anyone can be alone for some period of time#Statement-non-opinion
but for me a lot of what I do requires a sense that there's this invisible barrier around me which people wil-,#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
will respect.#Other
And if that's gone, um, I, I really don't know how to live very well,#Statement-non-opinion
and I wonder, I really do wonder how people do that.#Statement-non-opinion
That's interesting.#Appreciation
Are th-, are there any other specific things that, that you feel like, where, where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency?#Yes-No-Question
All the class-, the other classic examples, the Jehovah's Witness or, or Mormons or someone knocking at the front door, um, which is more intrusive because I have to really tell someone to go away.#Affirmative non-yes answers
And there's that sense of, I have now opened my door they now see what I look like, what I live like#Statement-non-opinion
and nor-, and they're doing something that normally I really only invite,#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
people to.#Other
Because I, any, anyone, any friend, anyone I give my number to is welcome to call me,#Statement-non-opinion
but no one is just welcome to come by my house.#Statement-non-opinion
So that is more of a sense of invasion.#Statement-opinion
So, that's another example of the invasion because of the not so ...#Uninterpretable

Okay,#Other
well, some of the things I like to do are,#Statement-non-opinion
I like to knit.#Statement-non-opinion
I knit sometimes,#Statement-non-opinion
and I sew#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I like to sew sometimes for my kids.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I sew clothes for them every once in a while.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I make quilts.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow,#Appreciation
that's the next project that I'd like to learn to do.#Statement-non-opinion
I do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm, I'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch.#Statement-non-opinion
I was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt.#Statement-non-opinion
After a while, cross stitch, I th-,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know.#Hedge
I have#Statement-non-opinion
It gets boring.#Statement-opinion
to put it away#Other
and then I have to bring it back.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know. And, and, uh, I don't know why that is.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if it's looking at the little th-, things every time.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, it reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging, I think.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that might be it.#Agree/Accept
But I do#Statement-non-opinion
That might#Agree/Accept
and yet, there's,#Uninterpretable
a lot of it in the car.#Other
We,#Uninterpretable
Oh, do you?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
we commute from Plano to Dallas#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I have nearly an hour both ways that I can really get a lot of work done#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I bet.#Appreciation
I found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know that I could even think about quilting.#Statement-non-opinion
You have to have a pretty good frame, don't you, to#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
do any kind of quilting work?#Other
Yeah.#Yes answers
Uh, I've not really done any, too much challenging, uh, stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I can do it with a, a needle and thread#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, but, uh, and get about five small stitches in, which is pretty good,#Other
but it's very long.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's very tedious if you don't have a whole group, you're not finishing a quilt in a long time#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I bet.#Appreciation
So, uh,#Uninterpretable
But, it's such a lost art.#Statement-opinion
So, uh, I like to just mostly do the tie quilts.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's so much easier.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
But, uh, the other ones are very pretty.#Statement-non-opinion
They're, uh,#Uninterpretable
we have a quilt on our bed that's,#Statement-non-opinion
instead of, like, yarn#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they tied, uh, ribbon into it.#Other
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's real pretty.#Statement-non-opinion
I bet.#Appreciation
It's real pretty.#Statement-non-opinion
There's so many things I wish I had learned to do with my mother.#Statement-non-opinion
She had crocheted a full bedspread.#Statement-non-opinion
It's kind of a hobnail#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
looking thing.#Other
And when I look at it now, she's been dead for a long time#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think oh, why didn't I learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that people just don't know how to do.#Other
Now did you say you could knit?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Haven't tried that either.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I was going to say because,#Statement-opinion
I want to learn to crochet.#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
Because if you could knit, you could crochet.#Other
Really?#Backchannel in question form
It's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to, to weave the, the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then you just use your right hand with the hook.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's not,#Uninterpretable
it's really not too difficult.#Statement-non-opinion
You could learn that, I'm sure#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and pick that up.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If you, I think if you can do any handicraft, you can learn to crochet.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's not too difficult.#Statement-non-opinion
It's funny, when you were talking about sewing, I love to do anything by hand with a needle.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
But I'm totally intimidated if I sit down at a sewing machine.#Statement-non-opinion
I never learned,#Statement-non-opinion
and I get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me.#Statement-non-opinion
Isn't that interesting.#Rhetorical-Questions
But I just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that's really interesting.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And yet, you know, I think about, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
you said you do a lot of needlework#Statement-non-opinion
and, and there are some beautiful, just gorgeous patterns#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that people do.#Other
And I, I just think that, uh, that's one of, one of the arts that I think are really pretty.#Statement-non-opinion
And a lot of people don't do that either.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and so,#Uninterpretable
Well, it's hard to find the time.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I wouldn't if I didn't have this car time ability probably#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because at night if I sit down, I'm doing something with the kids or#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just not sitting down at all#Other
That's true.#Agree/Accept
You know, and, and I always think, well, I can do this and watch T V or something#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
And, uh, it seems like I always get my mind carried away to something else#Statement-non-opinion
and then it doesn't#Statement-non-opinion
Well, it,#Uninterpretable
quite work#Other
or,#Uninterpretable
I'm at the age where bifocals or trifocals would be necessary.#Statement-non-opinion
It's so I find myself putting glasses on to, to watch T V and then taking them off to do needlework#Statement-non-opinion
and I get frustrated doing that#Statement-non-opinion
so Just give it up.#Statement-non-opinion
And, you know, I like to sketch.#Statement-non-opinion
I can, I can sketch something, like if I see a picture, like, out of a book, I can sketch that#Statement-non-opinion
Ooh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's nice and everything,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, it's funny,#Statement-non-opinion
I can't I can't draw it out of my own head#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
kind of thing.#Other
I wish I could.#Statement-non-opinion
And, and yet I can't do, you know, like, like, uh, craft, uh, on wood.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can't do that painting thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And yet,#Uninterpretable
I'm the same way.#Agree/Accept
If I see something, I can copy it,#Statement-non-opinion
but I certainly can't create.#Statement-non-opinion
I admire people that have that in their minds already.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
me, too.#Agree/Accept
Me, too.#Agree/Accept
I know a woman who's just wonderful at that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I look at it#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, you look at those things#Statement-non-opinion
and you wish so badly that you could do them.#Statement-opinion
I guess, if you wanted to, you could take classes and learn.#Statement-opinion
I guess that's the only way I could do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, sometimes, even with that. I, I think you have to have some,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay,#Other
well yes,#Other
we do have pollution in Houston#Statement-non-opinion
and it,#Uninterpretable
How bad is it?#Wh-Question
Do you have smog like they do in California?#Yes-No-Question
Well it, it#Uninterpretable
some,#Other answers
I think it depends on, uh, you know, what the, ho-, the cloud cover#Statement-opinion
and like right now, it's, uh, it's kind of overcast, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
just, it's hot,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the sun is trying, tries to shine through#Statement-non-opinion
but it's, it's holding in this, this pollution#Statement-opinion
and I,#Uninterpretable
It depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion, I take it.#Statement-opinion
I think so,#Agree/Accept
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we have, uh, Pasadena, Texas which is sort of between here an, you know, heading toward Galveston,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it's still part of, it's part of the Houston metroplex.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What do you think is your primary cause of it.#Wh-Question
Well, I think it's industry#Statement-opinion
and I think it's cars.#Statement-opinion
You do?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
You really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas?#Yes-No-Question
I don't, I,#Uninterpretable
well maybe not,#Hedge
but, it, it sure, it sure, se-,#Statement-opinion
you know, it,#Uninterpretable
I, I know that when I'm, when I'm behind a car#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, sometimes, uh, I can really smell especially diesel and things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, comes right into my air conditioner#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, my head and my fa-,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm so stopped up right now,#Statement-non-opinion
Um,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
my goodness.#Appreciation
I don't know if it's, uh, if it's partly from what's blooming, you know, right now, pollen and stuff like that,#Statement-non-opinion
that's part of it,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think a lot of it's industrial.#Statement-opinion
I also think, uh, that, uh, there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles#Statement-opinion
but it's mostly from older automobiles.#Statement-opinion
I don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting, uh, frankly.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that, uh, I think that, uh, uh,#Statement-opinion
if, uh,#Uninterpretable
I, I, I heard a story a while back#Statement-non-opinion
something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent, or, take all the cars off the road that have been, uh, manufactured say before nineteen seventy-five,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining.#Other
You mean, uh, fifty percent pollution total#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
from that comes from,#Other
From, from cars#Collaborative Completion
that is, not, not total but just from cars,#Statement-non-opinion
okay.#Uninterpretable
Oh, uh-huh.#Response Acknowledgement
So, that I think would be tremendous help.#Statement-opinion
But I happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical#Statement-non-opinion
and it just keeps getting, uh, gives me good service#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
On the other hand I know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars I have.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, that may be part of the problem.#Statement-opinion
Als-,#Uninterpretable
Do you all have pollution in your co-, part of the country, uh, from industry?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah,#Yes answers
yeah,#Yes answers
oh, uh, yeah,#Yes answers
it's, it's, uh, pretty heavy up here I think#Statement-opinion
but I think it's mostly industrial, is what I really, uh, believe is the, the main problem.#Statement-opinion
And, and, uh,#Uninterpretable
and, uh, uh, people, uh, I don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should.#Statement-opinion
I, I we, we seem to have a high, uh, cancer rate up here in Maryland.#Statement-opinion
Really,#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
like what ki-,#Uninterpretable
any particular kind or just all kinds?#Or-Clause
Well, for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant#Statement-opinion
and, uh, I think,#Uninterpretable
of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, th-, this state was like the second,#Statement-non-opinion
my wife's a registered nurse,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think this state was like second this year from the top, in terms of, uh, cancer rate for just all kinds.#Statement-opinion
And I can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution.#Statement-opinion
I just don't know exactly what it necessarily is,#Statement-opinion
but I just can't believe it is.#Statement-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now we have a lot of pollution being caused by cloruph-, uh, fluorocarbons which is the, like freon twelve and freon twenty-two.#Statement-non-opinion
They use freon twenty-two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners#Statement-non-opinion
and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer, that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also,#Statement-opinion
and having all kinds of effects,#Statement-opinion
and.#Uninterpretable
Well what can we do about the, the, the, the air conditioning problem?#Wh-Question
Well they're working now,#Statement-non-opinion
I know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working, uh, feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and who ever does is going to make, uh, a mint.#Statement-opinion
Because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons, then, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Is that also what's in, uh, hairsp-, aerosol?#Yes-No-Question
Well they used to be,#Affirmative non-yes answers
but they made them take it out of that.#Statement-non-opinion
Even, so, so the aerosol is still aerosol,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
but it doesn't have anything that's damaging.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
they, they, they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well that's good.#Statement-opinion
and that was a move in the right direction.#Statement-opinion
We are doing some things to try to correct the problem.#Statement-non-opinion
But there are more things we could do#Statement-opinion
and getting rid of old cars, like I said is one way to help correct the problem.#Statement-opinion
Uh, uh, just trying to I think be careful, uh, with the way you handle garbage,#Statement-opinion
I notice in this state,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if you're doing it in Texas yet or not,#Statement-non-opinion
but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces, uh, you know, containers in,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
Here, they've just started, started doing that,#Statement-non-opinion
it's, it's, you know,#Uninterpretable
you're not, you don't have to,#Statement-non-opinion
but m-, you know,#Uninterpretable
I know I am.#Statement-non-opinion
I save,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too.#Statement-non-opinion
But they, uh,#Uninterpretable
in one of the counties here, they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police.#Statement-non-opinion
They have a lady that goes around like a meter maid#Statement-non-opinion
and she spot checks people's trash.#Statement-non-opinion
No kidding,#Appreciation
really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash,#Statement-non-opinion
Is that right.#Backchannel in question form
they'll fine you fifty bucks I think the first time and two fifty the second time.#Other
Well, we need to do something,#Statement-opinion
we need to get serious about it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you,#Uninterpretable
right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you've got to get people to see i-,#Statement-opinion
and surprisingly enough just handling of trash, uh, can cut pollution, uh, from, uh, uh, from just throwing it in a dump, or, or, or, where ever else they used to do with it, maybe used to burn it.#Statement-opinion
They've stopped that up here too.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But that, that will cut pollution too.#Statement-opinion
Because you get a lot of out gassing from these things, I think, decaying and tr-, and trying to,#Statement-opinion
for instance cans and bottles, they never go away at all.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But on, on the other hand, I don't guess they're polluting.#Statement-opinion
But plastic containers and the like, uh, they may be,#Statement-opinion
I'm not sure of that.#Statement-non-opinion
How much does, uh, planting more trees and things like that help?#Open-Question
Oh I think that's very important to do.#Statement-opinion
too.#Uninterpretable
I, I really think that, uh, trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very, very important thing.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, that can help to cut pollution, I guess some.#Statement-opinion
I, I don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air.#Statement-opinion
I would hope that they would help some, though.#Statement-opinion
That's for sure.#Statement-opinion
I think, uh, it seems like there was something going on, around here, that, you know,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out, you know, like in the middle of the night, they would go ahead and do it anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
I think they got caught.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh good.#Appreciation
But I wonder how much of that kind of stuff, you know, goes on.#Statement-non-opinion
Well that, uh, that I think may go on a lot#Statement-opinion
and the primary reason I think it may go on a lot is just as you said, somebody happened to stay up late at night or something.#Statement-opinion
I don't think we have a adequate policing, uh, particularly on industry.#Statement-opinion
Uh, we have good policing, at least in this state and, and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too, of car pollutants#Statement-opinion
because we have to go down, uh, once a year here in Maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, we have to, uh, we have to have a state inspection every year.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you all have that?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, no,#No answers
we don't have a state inspection,#Statement-non-opinion
So,#Uninterpretable
which I,#Uninterpretable
I don-,#Uninterpretable
I would assu-,#Uninterpretable
but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state.#Statement-non-opinion
So I'm assu-, I'm assuming that, you know, they check, they check everything for safety#Declarative Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Other answers
uh, that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities.#Statement-non-opinion
But in this state we have to, uh, pay eight dollars and a half and go to a, an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are, have been made starting in nineteen seventy-three.#Statement-non-opinion
But that's all they check for,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
they don't check how good,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
no,#No answers
we don't have inspections like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Now, I'm in Maryland,#Statement-non-opinion
in Virginia they check that every two years, I think.#Statement-opinion
We do that ev-, every year.#Statement-non-opinion
And I think that's a good idea too,#Statement-opinion
not, no-, not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think it's a good idea.#Statement-opinion
The emission check, though, is required in Maryland#Statement-non-opinion
and it's also required in Virginia, uh, a sister state to, to this one.#Statement-non-opinion
And that's, that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants.#Statement-opinion
Well I'll have to check,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not sure if, if our state inspection ever-,#Statement-non-opinion
once a year has to do, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
if they check the, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well if they don't I would imagine in time they'll get a law with. i-, get around to it,#Statement-opinion
and if they don't then that's something I would certainly, uh, uh, suggest you be willing to uh, uh, be for in terms of, uh,#Statement-opinion
Oh, I would#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or, or, or anything.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I agree.#Agree/Accept
Now that's another area we haven't even discussed#Statement-non-opinion
and that is water pollution and various of the other types of, uh, of, uh, like food pollution.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean you, you hardly ever hear, hear anybody say anything about food pollution.#Statement-non-opinion
But I think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries,#Statement-opinion
so, uh, hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of, uh, pollutants in our food.#Statement-non-opinion
But water pollution, uh,#Uninterpretable
I've worried, especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know a lot more people are going to bottled water.#Statement-non-opinion
Well#Dispreferred answers
and that's not necessarily the answer either#Statement-opinion
because they've found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
tap,#Repeat-phrase
yeah#Uninterpretable
So,#Uninterpretable
but a lot of these, uh,#Uninterpretable
some of this#Uninterpretable
well, you know, a lot of people have well water,#Statement-opinion
in fact in this area too#Statement-non-opinion
and, an, you know,#Uninterpretable
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're, what you're drinking#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I know a lot of people, you know, have that#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, you have to wonder if that, you know could have an adverse affect on them too,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if they don't, i-, they don't get it checked.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course, have it checked#Statement-non-opinion
because it seems, uh,#Statement-opinion
when I was a kid growing up down south, uh, I used to go out in the country where my grandparents were#Statement-non-opinion
and we had a well,#Statement-non-opinion
it was one of those draws that,#Statement-non-opinion
I forget what you call those things,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and that was some of the best tasting water,#Statement-opinion
I mean, I can still to this day taste that water.#Statement-non-opinion
When we were,#Uninterpretable
when I was growing up I lived in Huntsville, Alabama,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and their water supply came from, uh, spring.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was like ice cold, spring water#Statement-non-opinion
and I guess parts of the, the city still ha-, you know, get that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, that was, that was really wonderful.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I bet it was.#Appreciation
It was really, really good.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the-,#Uninterpretable
once it's been filtered an if it's a deep enough well, filtered through all the earth and everything I think that, uh,#Statement-opinion
it depends of course where you are.#Statement-opinion
A good well, though, I think is very healthy ...#Statement-opinion

So, how do we fix the national budget?#Wh-Question
Damned if I know.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
I suspect, uh,#Uninterpretable
let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
I suspect we should do what everyone says we should do,#Statement-opinion
we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes#Statement-opinion
but Lord knows you sh-, one shouldn't say that.#Statement-opinion
Well,#Dispreferred answers
I, I, I suspect we should probably have an independent auditing agency go in and look at how the government spends money. And work from there.#Statement-opinion
That would probably be good,#Appreciation
but,#Statement-opinion
Because I, because I don't think they're very good at it.#Other
something that the government hasn't been looking at is the source of the problem.#Other
Huh.#Uninterpretable
The true source of the problem is, a, that we do spend too much,#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but also, b, that we don't take in enough.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, wh-, wh-, wh-, why do you say that actually?#Wh-Question
Uh, too few Americans are working.#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
If more Americans were working and meaningful good paying labor,#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and paying taxes,#Other
Rather than using taxes.#Collaborative Completion
and the tax structure was fair between the lowest and the highest income Americans, then we would have more money there to play with.#Other
Oh, that's interesting.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's probably true,#Appreciation
I mean, well, we also, we'd be spending less because all the money that, that normally goes to support those people aren't working, it's back in the system.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you're right.#Appreciation
That's a real neat idea.#Statement-opinion
Well, what,#Uninterpretable
but, I mean, what can, you know,#Uninterpretable
at, at some point, what can you do to sort of raise rev-, I mean, to raise jobs I wonder.#Declarative Wh-Question
Well, I hesitate to say we ought to spend ourselves to affluence#Hedge
but, in fact, in some cases that's what we ought to do.#Statement-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
So, start .#Uninterpretable
Not Reaganomics, thank you.#Statement-opinion
But, that's not going to work, uh,#Statement-opinion
Uh, what I was thinking more along the lines of is start going to space.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
And that way just create more jobs or whatever?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, at some point there, there will be enough jobs for most of the ab-, able-bodied Americans.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Huh.#Response Acknowledgement
well, that's a neat idea.#Appreciation
We also need to, uh, assure that there's some work in the private sector.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's what, that's what,#Uninterpretable
yo-, you think space would do that much for that#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
I think it would do something for it.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I think we would fill up new technologies.#Statement-opinion
But I think we should also do something rather radical.#Statement-opinion
Like what?#Declarative Wh-Question
Legalize marijuana.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you think, you think that would, uh, have a major effect?#Yes-No-Question
Well, that would put a lot of criminals out of business for a while anyway.#Statement-opinion
What?#Signal-non-understanding
Th-, that might have a, uh, a good effect on, on, on crime anyway.#Statement-opinion
Yes, uh,#Agree/Accept
okay,#Hold before answer/agreement
I think it would take some of that money out of the hands of criminals.#Statement-opinion
I think it would put, reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another.#Statement-opinion
That's probably true.#Appreciation
I think that, I think most importantly it would give the federal government something new that they could tax.#Statement-opinion
And probably a lot of.#Statement-opinion
And probably a lot of#Statement-opinion
and really receive some revenues from.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but that's potentially ,#Uninterpretable
Uh, if you look at prohibition historically, it's repeal helped the federal government a lot in tax revenues.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh, huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No,#Uninterpretable
I had never thought about that.#Statement-non-opinion
Then I think once we put money back into the cof-, in the coffers of the federal government,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and get the federal government to where there's money there again, we should reduce the amount of money,#Other
and this would have to come rather quickly, and would have to come originally also where we're not paying,#Statement-opinion
in some cases we do pay more, for welfare recipients to live then they can earn in the true minimum wage environment.#Statement-opinion
That's true we do, often times they are paid more, yeah.#Appreciation
And you can't deny people the right to supply their families better through whatever means.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's just sensible on their part.#Statement-opinion
That's just what on their part,#Signal-non-understanding
I'm sorry,#Apology
I missed that.#Statement-non-opinion
It's just sensible on their parts,#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Response Acknowledgement
to go after the, the, the greater amount of income.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, if you lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs, not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage, then more people will get off welfare.#Statement-opinion
That, that maybe true.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's very true.#Appreciation
You know, give them a true incentive to want to work.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then don't start letting more outsiders in for a few years until we figure out exactly where we're at with unemployment.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's a,#Uninterpretable
Reduce immigration,#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
or eliminate it entirely for a few years, until we get our own house in order.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and maybe even reduce, al-, along the same lines, maybe reduce imports as well, I think.#Statement-opinion
Oh, absolutely,#Agree/Accept
absolutely.#Agree/Accept
I mean . We don't need to buy other people's stuff right now . *#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Appreciation
when we're in a world of hurt, well, I don't, I'm not going to say that we ought to re-, reduce them through legal means.#Statement-opinion
I think we ought to just tax them severely.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, that, that's what happened in other country though.#Statement-non-opinion
And other places they tax us quite ha-,#Statement-opinion
I mean, they tax American imports quite heavily.#Statement-opinion
So, we could do the same thing,#Statement-opinion
I mean, just,#Uninterpretable
and, you know, they may get,#Uninterpretable
It seems only fair.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it does seem only fair,#Agree/Accept
I mean, why not.#Rhetorical-Questions
And I think really if we got all those that are able-bodied into the work force reduced the amount going out for those purposes, created new jobs for that work force, there would be plenty of money.#Statement-opinion
I think so.#Agree/Accept
And then at that point,#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
quit spending on space.#Other
Oh real ,#Uninterpretable
Force it all into the, into the private sector.#Statement-opinion
Oh, really I love the switch.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, at that point you might, we, i-, i-, it wouldn't be a problem anymore possibly, you know,#Statement-opinion
we would be,#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
we would be able to keep it wherever we wanted to in space or the ocean research whatever we wanted to do,#Other
but I think the,#Uninterpretable
Uh, space was just a convenient place for me to go because that would put a lot of,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a lot of#Other
Millspec and NASA work operates to the same demanding specifications,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that would put a bunch of defense workers back to work.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
compared to defense.#Collaborative Completion
Well, that's a good idea.#Statement-opinion
Well, it,#Uninterpretable
well, the other thing, and the other thing I, I, I think we seriously need to do is, um, like I say, have someone go in and look and, you know, and find out where it is we're paying ten thousand dollars per toilet seat or something.#Statement-opinion
You know what causes that?#Yes-No-Question
Um, greed, I suspect.#Other answers
Uh, no.#Dispreferred answers
Your, your buying large , uh,#Uninterpretable
the government specifications,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sheets of paper for building a pair of B V D underwear for the federal government,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is twenty-two foot tall.#Other
Really?#Backchannel in question form

For making, you mean, government issue underwear?#Yes-No-Question
For making government issue underwear.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Jesus.#Appreciation
To just understand those legal requirements and operate within the government guidelines,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
costs the company a huge amount of money.#Other
Well, that's potentially a fault of the government then, I mean, that could, things like that should,#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
a huge amount of it is not the fault of the contractor.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, that's a,#Uninterpretable
I had never heard that before.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, a huge amount of what you hear on, about the seventy-five dollar hammers,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the nine hundred dollar toilet seats doesn't come from people in the industry,#Other
it comes from senators that don't know anything about it.#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
Uh, my job is government tooling specialist.#Statement-opinion
Oh, okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, you know about some of these things.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept

Yeah.#Other
Yes,#Other
I talked with, um, I talked with people from Richardson and Plano#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, the first three days,#Uninterpretable
and then yesterday I talked with someone with, from Pennsylvania,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because,#Uninterpretable
it's the,#Uninterpretable
I've only made,#Uninterpretable
this is only my third call.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I tried to make calls two different days#Statement-non-opinion
and I couldn't get through.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I know.#Agree/Accept
Sometimes I just#Uninterpretable
I'm, in,#Uninterpretable
it just takes a very long time#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Does it?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've been trying to, you know, do that,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and sometimes I just can't wait that long,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I know.#Agree/Accept
so I just hang up.#Statement-non-opinion
Well.#Dispreferred answers
Because it keeps going through the thing over and over again.#Other
This is hilarious#Statement-opinion
But I knew as soon as I heard your voice,#Statement-non-opinion
I thought, Kathy's, it's Kathy Kester#Statement-non-opinion
Oh. Well, tell me, what books have you read lately?#Wh-Question
Well, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
I, um, gosh, I can't even think.#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't read any,#Statement-non-opinion
and you're such a reader, I know that#Statement-non-opinion
and I,#Uninterpretable
Well, I don't read all that much for enjoyment.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I read a lot for school,#Statement-non-opinion
but gee, I just don't have much time for enjoyment reading#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The, the last book I picked up was a book by Judy Bloom,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it was, um, it was called, um, SMART WOMEN, I think.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, or something like that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was, it was kind of,#Uninterpretable
I really didn't like it at all.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was, it was written back in the early eighties.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was all this, this, um, divorced woman syndrome#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of the, um,#Other
it was almost like a, a pre-AIDS scare kind of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Interesting.#Appreciation
It was really an interesting,#Agree/Accept
because I, I right away looked at when it was copyrighted.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I could tell by the theme of almost when it was written.#Other
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
And it was all about women searching for themselves. *#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, you know, a lot of hanky-panky,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
going on.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That kind of was, um, kind of a pop psychology time for wh-, when a lot of books like that were coming out, I think.#Statement-opinion

And so that makes real sense, that that's, um, when it was written.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I haven't, wasn't really aware that she had written anything for, um, adults.#Statement-non-opinion
I was always,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just more aware of her jer-, you know,#Other
for her young people, her books. *#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and she's more famous for that,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but she has been writing for adults also,#Statement-non-opinion
I'll be darned.#Appreciation
and so I thought hey, I'll just try this, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and see what it was like.#Other
It was very, um,#Uninterpretable
the style was very conversational.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You would have lots of conversations between people#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
rather than any description.#Other
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know how that is,#Rhetorical-Questions
and um,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I wonder if she's written anything really recently, if she's got anything printed, in print.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
she has,#Statement-non-opinion
because I, I remember seeing a new book by her#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that was out,#Other
and I think it was a, it was an adult book.#Statement-non-opinion
I'll be darned.#Appreciation
So anyway,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but that's the last thing I, I've read,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um,#Uninterpretable
Well, it's,#Uninterpretable
I'm trying to think the last actual book I read that wasn't,#Statement-non-opinion
let's see, I think I read, oh,#Hold before answer/agreement
when I was on vacation, um, between semester break and summer, you know, on semester break between spring and summer#Hold before answer/agreement
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I went to my mother's,#Hold before answer/agreement
I read a book that I have, should have read when I was probably in high school.#Statement-non-opinion
I read, um, JANE EYRE.#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
No,#Reject
wait a minute,#Hold before answer/agreement

JANE EYRE?#Yes-No-Question

it wasn't JANE EYRE.#Statement-non-opinion
WUTHERING HEIGHTS?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
it was, um, uh, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
by Jane Austen.#Other
by Jane Austen,#Repeat-phrase
yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's what it was,#Statement-non-opinion
yes.#Agree/Accept
Yes.#Agree/Accept
And, um, you know, I, I didn't know what to expect, except I had heard that, that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist,#Statement-non-opinion
and she really was good.#Statement-opinion
I mean, I was, was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Uninterpretable
intricately#Other
and, um, and, you know, I just,#Uninterpretable
but I, as I say, I was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
*#Non-verbal
Because I, I think I was, I think I read it in college,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh. *#Other
or had to write it, read it in high school or college,#Other
but I don't remember it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I got her the, I got her someone,#Other
I think it was, um, oh, some actress reading it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how interesting.#Appreciation
You know, they had an abridged version of it on tape.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so I got that for her,#Statement-non-opinion
and she loved doing that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I'll bet,#Appreciation
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I remember that was the book.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And now I, I mean, I think it's around here somewhere,#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I wouldn't be,#Appreciation
I'm just going to have to put it,#Statement-non-opinion
surprised,#Other
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the car sometimes and listen to it.#Other
Sure.#Appreciation
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um,#Uninterpretable
Well, I read that,#Statement-non-opinion
and then I'm trying to think, um,#Hold before answer/agreement
usually I try to, to find something long that,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm going to,#Other
when#Uninterpretable
if, if I have long periods of time, like Christmas vacation, or, you know, when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while, um,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Oh, that's what I do too.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's about it, because otherwise I'm reading so much for school.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, um, I have just started reading a book.#Statement-non-opinion
Actually, it's for school,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's for, um,#Uninterpretable
there's a, a literary jour-,#Uninterpretable
well, not a literary journal,#Uninterpretable
it's a, it's kind of a journal of, of the history of ideas that's, that's starting to be published, um, from U T D.#Statement-non-opinion
The first issue doesn't come out until next year,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um,#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm doing some reviews of books, just to, what, to sort of recommend to wh-, whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how neat.#Appreciation
and I've,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's really neat because these are brand new books#Statement-non-opinion
and I,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, great.#Appreciation
just got a, I got a, th-, this one,#Other
um, most of the stuff is on, uh, literary criticism and philosophy,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and religion and all that.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's a, a, a biography,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, great.#Appreciation
that is really interesting,#Other
Oh, that's fascinating.#Appreciation
I mean, it, it's fascinating,#Agree/Accept
it really is.#Agree/Accept
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, but it's so long,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I don't really have the time to read the whole thing,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
eventually I'll go back to it.#Other
But it's,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was written,#Other
I mean the, the copyright is nineteen ninety-one,#Statement-non-opinion
so it's a brand new book.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, it's a brand new book.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, that, that would be wonderful#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to read something like that.#Other
and he really, this man really shed some light on, um, some,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
aspects of of Bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything.#Other
I mean, you know, that was#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was families had just loads of musicians#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and they just went from generation,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
probably to generation,#Other
that's right.#Agree/Accept
just with these, with these all passing it from one to the other.#Other
Yes,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's the way it was, I'm sure back then.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, that's interesting.#Appreciation
it was just really interesting,#Agree/Accept
if that's, you know, that's kind of what,#Uninterpretable
but I have to#Uninterpretable
not only am, am I re-, reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed, but also, um, because the board of advisers for this, um, journal doesn't have, right now doesn't have a really respected name, um, who's a, uh, a scholar on, on music,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, and I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be a, you know, in that position on the board#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know if I want to take that responsibility or not,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Wow, that's rough.#Appreciation
But at least I,#Other
That's real rough.#Appreciation
can tell them what I think,#Other
so, um,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's real interesting.#Other
Well, that's a neat thing to be involved in. *#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Agree/Accept
Because I think our, I think my alma mater, um, Gettysburg, I think they were just starting a magazine *#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that was similar to that.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's probably a, sort of a thing to do#Statement-opinion
Yes#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in small colleges,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, um,#Uninterpretable
that it,#Uninterpretable
you know, you see, you see a lot of small colleges doing things,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like that,#Other
right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because it attracts really a, a lot people's interest.#Statement-opinion
That's one way,#Uninterpretable
it's really good public relations for small schools,#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think so#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, another one of my projects this summer is, actually it's part of my research assistantship, is, um, it's helping a professor, uh, compile a bunch of translations of, of various poems for a book that he's writing,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I'm learning the names, if not the actual contents, of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people.#Other
Now, translations, what do you mean, translations of, of,#Wh-Question
Um, well, where, where, for instance, um, a Baudelaire poem that was written,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the French and then has been translated into English by,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
various people.#Other
Oh, I see.#Response Acknowledgement
And the translations are all so different from one another.#Statement-non-opinion
All different.#Repeat-phrase
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, that's interesting.#Appreciation
So it's multiple translations of single works#Statement-non-opinion
and, and that's right now, right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as, um,#Statement-non-opinion
my work, is just kind of compiling,#Statement-non-opinion
Gosh.#Appreciation
all that for him.#Other
So,#Uninterpretable
That's great.#Appreciation
It's real interesting.#Agree/Accept
Boy, you really lift me up to a different,#Appreciation

I mean, here I, I'm dealing with, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
*#Other
cleaning the stove#Other

Oh, well, let me tell you, *#Other
You know, I'm#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then come home and get back into regular clothes again#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, you know, there's real no, no real dress code where I work.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, you see people wearing, you know, all different attire.#Statement-non-opinion
I, um, don't like to wear heels, that really tires me out.#Statement-non-opinion
I work in a big building.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I predominantly wear flat shoes.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, you know, in the winter I wear sweaters,#Statement-non-opinion
in summer I, you know, I like one piece dresses, short sleeves, things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
I've recently, um, tried to update my wardrobe, trying to put suits together that I can interchange, the,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
jackets and the blouses and all that a lot.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's helped me a lot with having,#Statement-non-opinion
I can only have a, a limited wardrobe, since I'm only,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
working part-time right now.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, but still, it gives it some variety.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that.#Other

It's nice you can wear shorts, especially on a day like today when it's so hot.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, they're, um, you know, they're like Ber-,#Statement-non-opinion
Dress shorts.#Collaborative Completion

And sometimes I wear a blazer with them,#Statement-non-opinion
and I get really a lot of compliments on them.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, where I work is predominantly male.#Statement-non-opinion

So, you know, they,#Uninterpretable
their attire is always the same, you know. Suits or slacks,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know, jeans, whatever.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but ,#Uninterpretable
And, um, but I'm really the only woman, I guess, at work that does that,#Statement-non-opinion
but seems to work for me#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but .#Uninterpretable
In fact, I just bought, I, I just got a new outfit as a gift that, um,#Statement-non-opinion
it's one of those skorts,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, th-,#Uninterpretable
it's shorts but it looks like a skirt.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I think that'll be good for work, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It'll be comfortable.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So,#Uninterpretable
I guess down here, uh,#Uninterpretable

so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, we moved from Colorado where,#Statement-non-opinion

But, um, you know, I, I do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses.#Statement-non-opinion

I'd like to be able to wear those here.#Statement-non-opinion
Today it's eighty-eight degrees.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my#Appreciation

Needless to say, my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now#Statement-non-opinion

Today was, uh, definitely a shorts day around here.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we're still pretty much, you know, in winter, as far as that goes here.#Statement-non-opinion
This is pretty un-, unseasonal,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, at least, we,#Uninterpretable
you know, it, it, it feels good,#Statement-non-opinion
it gets, uh,#Uninterpretable
everybody doesn't have cabin fever today.#Statement-non-opinion
It's nice to get,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess we've discussed everything there is about clothing#Statement-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Okay.#Other
Okay,#Repeat-phrase
where have you all been on vacation recently?#Wh-Question
Recently,#Statement-non-opinion
my most recent trip was last year,#Statement-non-opinion
and that was Detroit.#Statement-non-opinion
Detroit?#Signal-non-understanding
Yeah.#Yes answers
Is that a nice vacation spot?#Yes-No-Question
Well, it wasn't really.#Negative non-no answers
It was, um, uh, to see an old relative.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Response Acknowledgement
okay.#Response Acknowledgement
And it was, uh, just to, uh, have some fellowship with her.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
The only thing that I, I visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is Cancun, Mexico.#Statement-non-opinion
Ooh, that would be nice.#Appreciation
And that was real nice. Uh,#Statement-opinion
Did you scuba dive there?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.#Statement-non-opinion
Ooh, that would be nice.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that would be enjoyable.#Appreciation
from our daily routine.#Other
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's,#Appreciation
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a nice break.#Other
I haven't been on vacation in a while either.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which is up kind of near Denver.#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing.#Other
Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from.#Appreciation
So it's a lot of fun.#Statement-non-opinion
I worked up there last summer,#Statement-non-opinion
so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, that's nice.#Appreciation
whole summer long#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Worked at a camp there,#Statement-non-opinion
and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains.#Statement-non-opinion
So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's canoeing.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River,#Statement-non-opinion
and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, I guess Colorado,#Statement-non-opinion
and they've really enjoyed it.#Statement-non-opinion
That's nice.#Appreciation
We, um,#Statement-non-opinion
It's a whole new,#Statement-non-opinion
we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's the best place that I've ever canoed.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
It's really, really pretty.#Statement-opinion
I was a little kid then,#Statement-non-opinion
and we to have, uh,#Uninterpretable
we stayed at some park#Statement-non-opinion
and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night,#Statement-non-opinion
and he would give a little talk about mountain things.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man,#Statement-non-opinion
but we were pretty convinced he was a full,#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
hermit who lived up in,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,#Other
and we would have to, we'd#Statement-non-opinion
and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
Oh, that's neat.#Appreciation
That's a good family place to go,#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening,#Statement-opinion
but it wasn't,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, too easy either.#Other
It was like,#Statement-opinion
Well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too,#Statement-opinion
and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
and I think they really it really pen-, penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because it's something you weren't forced to do#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you're more receptive.#Statement-opinion
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
Well, we, um, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then I went to England#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's exciting.#Appreciation
a few years ago.#Other
I was a,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
student there and spent, um, a semester studying abroad in London.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, there's not a language barrier#Statement-non-opinion
so you don't,#Uninterpretable
I mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean,#Statement-non-opinion
and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents,#Statement-opinion
but it's, it was really fun.#Statement-opinion
I, I, I really enjoyed that.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm probably going back there to work,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for a year.#Other
Well, I had a friend that, uh, visited England not, well, I think it's been probably two years now,#Statement-non-opinion
but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to England,#Statement-non-opinion
because she really has a great desire to do that,#Statement-non-opinion
because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it.#Statement-non-opinion
It, it's really nice.#Statement-opinion
I would, I would spend all my time in London,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or most of my time,#Other
and that's it was really different being in a big city,#Statement-non-opinion
because I don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are#Statement-non-opinion
and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate,#Statement-non-opinion
but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You could just kind of#Statement-non-opinion
Do your own thing.#Collaborative Completion
kind of walk around and observe,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I had a great time doing that.#Statement-non-opinion
It was really interesting.#Statement-opinion
That's wonderful.#Appreciation
There's a lot out there to see,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know,#Appreciation
I'll say .#Appreciation
I keep wanting to get up to,#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't, I haven't been anywhere else outside the United States.#Statement-non-opinion
I haven't been to Mexico or Canada or,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I lived across the street almost from Canada#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that was, that, that's a nice place.#Statement-opinion
Canada is very nice.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that would be nice.#Statement-opinion
I had a friend from there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yes,#Agree/Accept
absolutely.#Agree/Accept
help with all the language and all that.#Other
Sure,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
somebody that knows their way around.#Summarize/reformulate
So, yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's why, that's why England was nice.#Statement-non-opinion
Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week,#Statement-non-opinion
and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the,#Statement-non-opinion
most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you've been quite a few places there#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
we have.#Statement-non-opinion
We .#Statement-non-opinion
Once you think about it, huh.#Appreciation
We did, we whirlwinded through,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Europe.#Other
It was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day,#Statement-non-opinion
and you slept on the train at night.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's great.#Appreciation
But there wasn't a,#Uninterpretable
it was strange,#Statement-opinion
it was kind of sad,#Statement-opinion
there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in Germany knew English#Statement-non-opinion
and everyone in Switzerland,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
knew English.#Other
That's great.#Appreciation
So we were kind of pitiful.#Statement-non-opinion
We found one restaurant we were in and got seated,#Statement-non-opinion
and then no one knew English in there,#Statement-non-opinion
and we were just#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things.#Other
But it was,#Uninterpretable
What did you wind up with?#Wh-Question
Oh, I had fondue.#Statement-non-opinion
That was easy to say#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay#Response Acknowledgement
Tried to get fondue and white wine,#Statement-non-opinion
and that was,#Uninterpretable
Uh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we were able to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly.#Statement-non-opinion
There were some people at the next table who spoke English,#Statement-non-opinion
so we#Statement-non-opinion
They kind of guided you.#Summarize/reformulate
elicited their aid for a while#Other
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they were very helpful#Other
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, good.#Appreciation
It was, it was a pleasant time.#Other
I'd, I'd love to go back there.#Statement-non-opinion
There's just not time#Statement-non-opinion
There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.#Statement-opinion
I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the, the means to, uh, pursue our dreams.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess that's what retirement is all about.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
That and sleeping late#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I keep hoping for.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well#Conventional-closing
I understand that.#Statement-non-opinion
it was nice talking with you.#Other
Well, it was nice talking with you too, Craig.#Conventional-closing
And have a good afternoon.#Conventional-closing
You do the same.#Conventional-closing
Okay.#Conventional-closing
Thank you.#Thanking
Good-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay, Bill, um,#Other
as you think over the plans and so forth that the company you're working with now,#Statement-non-opinion
who do you work with at this time?#Wh-Question
Well, I own the company.#Statement-non-opinion
You own the company.#Repeat-phrase
All right.#Appreciation
I'm the president and C E O of the company.#Statement-non-opinion
My goodness.#Appreciation
So, uh, I guess, uh, I determine what the benefits are#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I guess you do.#Agree/Accept
But, uh, so what are you asking me,#Wh-Question
what, what benefits I think are most important?#Wh-Question
Well, what, what do you think of the,#Wh-Question
let's put it this way,#Hold before answer/agreement
what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you, other than, other than their present salary?#Wh-Question
Um, I'd say in today's economy, besides basic benefits, uh, such as, um, health insurance and life insurance and the, some type of retirement plan#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'd say that, uh, most of the employees, uh, um, that we have really like a, a profit sharing plan.#Other
A profit sharing plan,#Repeat-phrase
that's interesting,#Statement-non-opinion
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They like to participate in the profits of the company like they're, you know,#Statement-opinion
because they feel like, well, we're contributing to it,#Statement-opinion
so we'd like to participate in it,#Statement-non-opinion
and so that means I make a little bit less,#Statement-non-opinion
but the thing is that really you make a little more, because everybody has a interest in, in it working.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because they they have a specific reason to do so, because they themselves benefit from doing a better job.#Summarize/reformulate
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think most people, uh, don't want money, um,#Statement-opinion
it's been my experience, most people want, uh, to feel like they're participating in something that, uh, that is not a drudgery, you know, that they#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
enjoy, and that they can get some benefits out of.#Other
And it's a contribution.#Collaborative Completion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Well, Bill, uh, that idea fits me exactly.#Statement-non-opinion
I just retired from, uh, the university here,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's been the goal in my life, was to contribute and, to the work that I was doing in my research,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's what made me happy,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, that's the type of goal I think most people ought to look for,#Statement-opinion
and I'm sure a lot of them don't.#Statement-opinion
You can't stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
well, uh, our people get a lot of satisfaction.#Statement-opinion
Um, we're a financial planning firm.#Statement-non-opinion
You're a financial planning firm?#Repeat-phrase
Yes.#Agree/Accept
How many, uh.#Wh-Question
You said you retired,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
I just happen to have a person that I happened to do some planning for this morning,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
anyway, uh, uh, we do, we deal with a lot of people that are retired or trying to retire#Other
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well.#Uninterpretable
and, uh, it's real important, uh, that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that, where they were, that, uh, uh, that it take care of them.#Statement-opinion
They don't,#Uninterpretable
none of them really want to be rich,#Statement-opinion
but they like to have enough to be comfortable.#Statement-opinion
Well, what, what changes would you, have you considered, uh, in doing it, to, to your company, that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better?#Wh-Question
Well, um, we, considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a, a salary is, uh, is tie, um, uh, a percentage, um of business that, uh, that a person would participate and bring into the company.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, pay them, uh, based on the percentage of business they bring, instead of based on their salary.#Statement-non-opinion
And the re-,#Uninterpretable
When you say bring in, do you mean that they negotiated with people to, to come in and, uh, ask for your support?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
not necessarily.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, it can be in-house people who help you handle X amount of dollars.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Even though they didn't bring it in, they help it once it's there.#Statement-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
see, we have dif-, we have marketing people,#Other
and then we have financial planners,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, then we have, uh, staff secretaries and administrative assistants,#Statement-non-opinion
and these secretaries and administrative assistants, um, you know, if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company, they, they can get very dissatisfied very quickly.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, so, uh, we're thinking about paying them, instead of a percentage on salary, paying them a percentage on the business they handle.#Statement-non-opinion
So administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business.#Statement-opinion
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it, it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job,#Statement-opinion
but it might be whether the locality there, those people want that kind of support.#Statement-opinion
Well, and, and, but to,#Uninterpretable
see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to, or that they usually have several people they report to that, you know, that they work#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
together with#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it encourages them not to, uh, complain when they realize that they get a part of the, of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying, well make me do it.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
See, we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it.#Statement-opinion
I don't think anyb-, any#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think most people want to be, lack of better term-, terminology, they want to be self-employed,#Statement-opinion
but they don't want to take the risk.#Statement-opinion
In other words, they like to control their own future,#Statement-opinion
but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please#Statement-opinion
That's true.#Agree/Accept
without some real strict adherence,#Other
which,#Uninterpretable
that's what we have.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Well, I almost forgot the topic,#Statement-non-opinion
I was waiting so long for, uh, for it to find somebody. Um,#Statement-non-opinion
It's on your favorite T V shows and why.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
well, so what is your favorite T V show?#Wh-Question
Uh, MAJOR DAD.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you like that one?#Yes-No-Question
I, I love it,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it promotes good family values,#Statement-opinion
and it's funny.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I've never really watched that one.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows#Statement-opinion
That's ri-,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
and, uh, you know, there's, so there's only a few that I, that I like to watch routinely.#Statement-non-opinion
What kind do you like to watch?#Wh-Question
Probably my favorite is, um, oh,#Uninterpretable
well, I like shows like GROWING PAINS#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, what's the other one now, they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night,#Hold before answer/agreement
so I don't get to watch it very much.#Statement-non-opinion
WONDER YEARS?#Yes-No-Question
WONDER YEARS,#Repeat-phrase
yeah,#Yes answers
that's my favorite. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I like both of those real much also.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I think basically, they pr-, same thing, they promote family values.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
WONDER YEARS,#Repeat-phrase
I, I guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess I can really relate to it,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it's just a real cute show#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I, I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of, uh, I don't know, honesty or sort of a purity value, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
I do, too.#Agree/Accept
I, I don't like it, uh, lot of the shows that, that I've liked in the past, like, uh, oh, GOLDEN GIRLS#Statement-non-opinion
and, some of them tend to get so risque,#Statement-opinion
and when you#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
have children#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, watching it, that sometimes really starts to bother me#Other
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
and, uh, that's one of the reasons,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, if you want to go all time favorite show, probably one of them was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
my wife really likes that show,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Uninterpretable
which I just, I was, I always felt was wonderful#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, and so many of them nowadays, like I said, I think are just, um#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, they, they go after, well,#Statement-opinion
they,#Uninterpretable
like I said, the risque stuff, just I guess they think that's what people want to watch.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, there was,#Uninterpretable
but there's a sense of ho-, I guess, purity in the show,#Statement-opinion
like one of my favorite shows used to be HAPPY DAYS#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, you know, Richie always used to be so, you know, just so honest and pure#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess,#Other
and when he left the show, you know, that, it seemed to be missing that part of it#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I never did like it after that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, I don't know,#Hedge
I, I say, see the same thing in like WONDER YEARS and a lot of the shows that I like to watch.#Statement-opinion
There always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I agree.#Agree/Accept
Uh, do you like the sports programming?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
uh-huh.#Yes answers
Um, I, I enjoy those also, almost as, as much to a certain extent.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm,#Uninterpretable
our whole house is baseball fans#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, we enjoy that,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh#Uninterpretable
So you're going to watch a game tonight?#Yes-No-Question
oh yeah,#Yes answers
oh, yeah#Yes answers
So do you, do you have a favorite for the series or anything?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, probably the Pirates,#Statement-non-opinion
but only because of Steve Bushel, I guess#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
otherwise I really don't care that much,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, you know, I'm, I'm annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I'd like to see him do well, like all the way to the bank#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
he's a nice guy.#Statement-opinion
*#Non-verbal
I take it you live in the Dallas area.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Pardon? *#Other
Do you live in the Dallas area?#Yes-No-Question
Live in, live in Plano.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I live in Garland,#Statement-non-opinion
and, yeah,#Uninterpretable
I, I like Steve Bushel,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't really like the Pirates.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, uh, I'm kind of, I'm kind of pulling for the Braves over all,#Statement-non-opinion
they, you know, they#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they've come from so far down,#Other
I really would like to see them do well.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
so I keep hoping the Rangers are going to do#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
one, one year they,#Uninterpretable
maybe they'll make it, I don't know#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, but, uh, yeah,#Uninterpretable
I like sports programming quite a bit,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I guess my, my favorite shows are the,#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, that getting back to the point that you made, that's really true,#Agree/Accept
we were watching ROSEANNE, I guess, couple of weeks ago,#Statement-non-opinion
and her daughter was talking about birth control, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time,#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, she's only seven years old,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Well, it's,#Uninterpretable
so many of them now, um, you know, it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in,#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, you know, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm an adult#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I have adult tastes now,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't need that#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I, I like things that, uh, are, are wholesome, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well that, that seems to be more our values, too,#Statement-non-opinion
like the WONDER YEARS, I, I mean, it's kind of risque stuff for, maybe for teenagers,#Statement-opinion
you know, or, and you can kind of relate to it#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
I don't know,#Hedge
that's,#Uninterpretable
I enjoy that a lot#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, you know, I agree with you,#Agree/Accept
the,#Uninterpretable
and it's funny because the shows,#Uninterpretable
like a lot of them that used to be considered risque, like THREE'S COMPANY and stuff, I think they, they maintained,#Statement-opinion
people would watch them because#Uninterpretable
there was that, uh, you know, there was really the period that was going on there,#Statement-opinion
I mean, he really wasn't messing around with the girls,#Statement-non-opinion
but everybody perceived him that way, and stuff#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but as soon as, you know, he went to move in with another girl, the show just died#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's, it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way,#Statement-opinion

Well, this is a good subject, isn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
It's, it's something that you can really talk about.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I don't know what we're going to do about it,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about.#Other
Um, you know, when they say the Middle East,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's such a big area#Other
and there's so many different problems there.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, what do you want to concentrate on.#Wh-Question
It doesn't matter to me.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, uh, I'll tell you something,#Other
um, I, I have a sister-in-law from Israel,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and they're really quite, uh, arrogant about it all.#Statement-non-opinion
They, they believe that they, they belong there#Statement-non-opinion
and they've belonged there forever,#Statement-non-opinion
and, the Palestinians and the Arabs are, uh, more or less,#Statement-non-opinion
they, they consider them second class.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, they're really quite arrogant about it.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't, uh, I don't know if that contributes to the problem.#Statement-non-opinion
Well how did they feel about the, uh, the United States interven-, intervening with Patriot missiles,#Wh-Question
did, did they,#Uninterpretable
Oh, uh, I'm, I'm sure this is the one time that the Israelis are really happy to have their big brothers, the Americans,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, I didn't really talk about that with her.#Statement-non-opinion
She, um, um, my sister-in-law now lives in, um, Switzerland.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um, when they were living in Israel, it was, it was, the, the Palestinians, they, they come in an,#Statement-non-opinion
and they're, they're nothing but really servants for them,#Statement-non-opinion
and they really treat them like second class citizens.#Statement-non-opinion
They, they don't really want them around#Statement-non-opinion
but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But they, they really do,#Statement-non-opinion
they look down on them.#Statement-non-opinion
And, I don't know, being,#Uninterpretable
I, I live in, uh, Vermont#Statement-non-opinion
and being up here we pretty much treat everybody, you know, as someone that has merit, even if they're poor, or if they're Hispanic or if they're black.#Statement-non-opinion
We give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and, all the hurt in the big cities, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I-, if I lived in Washington, D C I think I'd have a different attitude about Black people#Statement-non-opinion
because I've heard that it, it, the, they're terrible, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just like it's a dog eat dog world.#Statement-opinion
And here, you know, all, all my black friends are professionals#Statement-non-opinion
and they're, they don't, you know, they don't go out and abuse drugs#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they send their kids to school#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they, they uh, you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's just a different world.#Statement-opinion
Well I live in San Antonio#Statement-non-opinion
and fifty percent of the population is minority.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, um, I talked to someone about San Antonio,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, um, they said that they, they have, you have quite the problem with, uh, the ghettos,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
do they call it the barrio down there.#Yes-No-Question
That's the barrios#Affirmative non-yes answers
but i-, it's, it's I don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city.#Statement-opinion
It's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I heard that sa-, San Antonio, unlike like, like a city like San Diego it se-, it just has a really bad problem.#Statement-non-opinion
I grew up outside of Houston#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't think, uh, as far as gang violence and things, I don't think it's any worse here than in Houston.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like say Houston.#Other
Now I would, now me not even knowing anything about Houston, I would think that it's a pretty calm city.#Statement-opinion
Houston is not at all.#Reject
No, huh,#Yes-No-Question
there's a lot of crime?#Yes-No-Question
Yes#Yes answers
there's quite a bit of crime.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my, um,#Appreciation
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like I, wer-, we're so protected up here,#Statement-opinion
it's, it's really strange.#Statement-opinion
I mean our red light district, I mean, uh, you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we're just so protected.#Statement-opinion
But, it's, it's, over in the Mid East, especially Israel, it's just like Israelis have a like a totalitarian system, when it comes to the Palestinians.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, the Israelis can do anything they want#Statement-non-opinion
but when it comes to Palestinians, if they're out in the street at night, it's, it's really looked on as odd.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, usually they're, they're bussed in to the, the, um, Jewish neighborhoods, and the Jewish cities#Statement-non-opinion
and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So they don't have that.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, what do you think about the mess that's, we've created in Iraq?#Open-Question
I think it's unfortunate, uh, as far as the Kurds are concerned,#Statement-non-opinion
it,#Uninterpretable
I thi-,#Uninterpretable
It's just what do you do for them,#Statement-opinion
you want to do something for them,#Statement-opinion
but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the, the country.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
we can't get involved in their civil war, um, unfortunately,#Statement-opinion
but we've kind of driven these people out.#Statement-opinion
To do it,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
but you see President Bush is telling them rebel, you know, uh, uprise.#Statement-non-opinion
And that's what they did#Statement-non-opinion
and now they're like asking him for help#Statement-non-opinion
and he's like, no we can't get involved.#Statement-non-opinion
What my husband had very strong feelings,#Statement-non-opinion
he, uh, agreed with, um, the General Schwartzkopf,#Statement-non-opinion
he said, um, he should have let, Bush should have let him finish his job.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Appreciation
He should, he should have let them, um, corner the Republican Guards,#Statement-non-opinion
Well I think the war ended too soon.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
exactly,#Agree/Accept
that's what everyone says.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
E-, everyone I talk to, they says, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it's real easy to say that.#Statement-opinion
We, we didn't damage enough of their arsenal.#Statement-opinion
We damaged most of it#Statement-non-opinion
but we, we should have gotten, made sure we got everything.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I don't think the higher ups were thinking about wh-, what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine.#Statement-opinion
They're going, oh, well it's not going to hurt us#Statement-opinion
so we're just going to let them go,#Quotation
but really we didn't think about the people that he was going, tr-,#Statement-opinion
and I mean, he, he's just,#Uninterpretable
Unfortunately though, the, the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of Kuwait.#Statement-non-opinion
And once that was accomplished it,#Statement-non-opinion
They, yeah, they, they did, they stuck right to their goals,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and right,#Uninterpretable
what they were going to say.#Statement-non-opinion
And the American people, when this first started, they were even reluctant to let them do that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So they were, they were playing it very safe,#Statement-opinion
but, you know, it, an ounce what do they say, an ounce of hind sight is worth, whatever.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Th-, they, I don't know, they, it, Schwartz-, Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done#Statement-non-opinion
and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it, to you know, the, uh, the go ahead to do it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because he had the fu-,#Uninterpretable
he knew what was going to happen, more than any of us.#Statement-non-opinion
Because I didn't realize that, um, *#Statement-non-opinion
it was going to make such a mess.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean I feel really sorry for these people,#Statement-non-opinion
these people are middle class people, just like us.#Statement-non-opinion
Can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood,#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you knew this,#Rhetorical-Questions
these people are going to come#Statement-non-opinion
and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you.#Statement-non-opinion
Of course, you're going, just going pick everything up that you can carry#Statement-opinion
and you're going to run.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it, it's just too bad that we couldn't see that.#Statement-opinion
I just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet. That I, I still feel like there's more to come.#Statement-opinion
I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned.#Statement-opinion
Well you know what I was hoping?#Rhetorical-Questions
I was hoping Iran was going to take a very, um, dramatic stand and invade, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and then like Iran's the big bad guy, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
but, really, if, if they were going to save people's lives,#Uninterpretable
They've got sixty or so of Iraq's planes.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I know,#Agree/Accept
it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict#Statement-opinion
but, I, I, you know, I almost swear, I'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians,#Statement-non-opinion
why they didn't go save,#Uninterpretable
I mean, I don't know if the Kurdish,#Uninterpretable
I know the Shiites are their people.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I don't know,#Hedge
I think they have a bond with the, the Kurds.#Statement-opinion
There are some Kurds living in Iran.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I think they should have just done more, uh,#Statement-opinion
and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid.#Statement-opinion
It's, it's just so complicated.#Statement-opinion
I was real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as, as much as they did.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, you,#Uninterpretable
knowing them, they're very, um, oh,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
almost compare them to a very egotistical man.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You're damn right,#Agree/Accept
I'm going to protect my family, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
so, I, I was amazed too.#Statement-non-opinion
I was really, I was really, um, proud of them, though, that they stayed out of it.#Statement-non-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it and from, from what I can tell if they had gotten into it, it would have started a whole new war.#Statement-opinion
Oh yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was, I#Uninterpretable
that part scared me.#Statement-non-opinion
That, that, um, the Egyptians would pull out#Statement-non-opinion
and I just saw atomic bomb,#Statement-opinion

Okay, you say you're going to buy a new car.#Summarize/reformulate
Well no,#Reject
it's probably going to be a very old used one.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband had an accident in my car a little over a week ago,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I drove a nineteen seventy-seven, um, B M W#Statement-non-opinion
and so I believe#Uninterpretable
and I'll know the answer today,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that they're going to total it.#Other
I think that it will cost more to fix it than it's probably worth.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I'm not interested in having any car payments,#Statement-non-opinion
so I actually went last weekend with,#Statement-non-opinion
my father was in town#Statement-non-opinion
and we went and looked at used cars around town.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and I, you know, I found like a nineteen eighty-four Regency Ninety-eight with only forty-six thousand miles on it#Statement-non-opinion
and that was pretty good condition, uh.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
But I also found a nineteen eighty Volvo, uh, station wagon#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that was in just super condition.#Other
I mean there's not a dent on the outside body,#Statement-non-opinion
the inside is clean#Statement-non-opinion
it's had the same owner for years.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It, it has about eighty thousand miles on it#Statement-non-opinion
but that's all right, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
the engine's in excellent shape,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I think it would last me probably another fifty or sixty thousand miles.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I guess I'm kind of in limbo waiting to see what the insurance is, you know, company is going to do, to see whether or not I can get one of these cars.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't want a new car though,#Statement-non-opinion
a new car payment.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I understand that.#Statement-non-opinion
We, uh, just paid off one, my wife's car, uh, I guess, la-, early last year#Statement-non-opinion
and so we're, you know, enjoying not having that, that payment every, every month#Statement-non-opinion
and, but it's getting up in age, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
we're trying to hold out a little while longer, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
we've got a, a y-, kno-, sho-, a daughter who's almost two now,#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
we're getting to the point where we really kind of need something a little bigger than what we've got,#Other
but, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I guess if we, when we do buy another car it'll, it'll be something that we can, uh, kind of grow into a little bit.#Other
It's, it's tough on trips because, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
anywhe-, anytime we, we're getting ready to go anywhere it's, uh, you know, it's, uh, try, like trying to put a puzzle together to make sure you get everything in the car, you know, cause it's,#Other
Well not only that, needing the room, you know, we finally ended up buying a Dodge Caravan here about two and a half years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
because I too, have very small kids.#Other
I, I have one that's now,#Statement-non-opinion
well she'll be four in September and then a little boy that's just turned two.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you know it's like you go on a trip#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, you pull over to the side of the road, throw them on the hood, change a diaper and keep going#Statement-non-opinion
And I wanted something that I could maybe walk through and get to them#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Right,#Agree/Accept
that's what,#Uninterpretable
I, I ideally, I would like that, in fact, uh, you know, I, I've, I've thought of that possibly, uh, getti-,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know that my wife would go for it,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Well.#Uninterpretable
You know, I would, I'd like to do that.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I have a truck myself#Statement-non-opinion
and i-, I'll, I'll take, you know,#Uninterpretable
a truck's a thing that yo-, you, you need when you need it,#Statement-opinion
but, you know,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the rest of the time you wonder, you know, could I use something else.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I, I've still got a couple years payments on it.#Statement-non-opinion
I may,#Uninterpretable
uh, if we can hold out til then, you know, I may get, get to where I need a something else, maybe, maybe buy a van, because they are, really, really nice for, for long trips especially.#Statement-non-opinion
We have definitely put a lot of use in on ours#Statement-non-opinion
and I understand, it is too expensive to have two car payments.#Statement-non-opinion
See that was the problem, my B M W was paid for,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my husband's been in business for himself for several years#Statement-non-opinion
and so he can depreciate cars,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but you hav-,#Uninterpretable
used to be you kept them three years.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well when they did all the tax law changes you had to keep them five.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I was trying to keep my B M W in tact, uh, for three more years.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
So that then I could take the van,#Other
and we'd trade my car in on a new car for his business.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so basically that's what I'm looking for in a used car. Something that's going to last me at least three years.#Statement-non-opinion
Well if I can pull a deal on this Volvo, you know, it will last me longer than that.#Statement-non-opinion
It will actually last me quite a while,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't know how families afford two new car payments.#Statement-non-opinion
It's just,#Statement-opinion
I don't either.#Statement-non-opinion
it's outrageous.#Other
Well, my wife's car is probably around five years old now,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's, it's got, oh, uh,#Uninterpretable
I guess it must have seventy or eighty thousand miles on it, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and so it, it's getting,#Statement-non-opinion
it's not, not in bad shape#Statement-non-opinion
it's, it's, you know, she's kept it up real well,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, you know, it's, it's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if we're going to get anything out of selling it.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
So, I'm, I'm, uh, I'm, I'm hoping we that we can work something out here.#Statement-non-opinion
We've got other bills that kind of pre-, precede, or preclu-, preclude us buying,#Statement-non-opinion
Know how that goes#Appreciation
something, buying something else.#Other
It's the pits,#Statement-opinion
isn't it?#Tag-Question
It really is#Affirmative non-yes answers
and, you know, and you can't, uh, you can't afford, you know, a, a car payment now.#Statement-non-opinion
It just,#Statement-non-opinion
That's right#Agree/Accept
will wipe you out every month,#Other
it's almost getting to be like the house payment, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
I know,#Agree/Accept
you can't find what you used to,#Statement-opinion
could find something for, you know, seventy-five, a hundred dollars a month.#Statement-opinion
It might not be brand new#Statement-opinion
but it was a decent car,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you just almost can't find that payment anymore.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, I understand that, it's, it's kind of hard to go do.#Statement-non-opinion
Well if you do look at them, I really recommend the Dodge Caravan.#Statement-non-opinion
We've had wonderful,#Statement-non-opinion
it's the only, uh, minivan they make that's on a car chassis instead of a truck chassis so it doesn't,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, shake you around like a tu-, a truck does.#Other
Oh, I didn't know that.#Statement-non-opinion
And we have had just wonderful luck with ours.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it's, we take it everywhere,#Statement-non-opinion
it it's been, it, it's so easy to get the kids in and out,#Statement-non-opinion
see my car was also a two door.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And which drove me nuts trying to get car seats and kids,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh man,#Appreciation
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
into a back seat, you know.#Other
And so it's wonderful to have the room and the space#Statement-non-opinion
and you can haul things#Statement-non-opinion
and they climb in easily#Statement-non-opinion
and, it's just been everything that we were hoping it would do for us.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it is nice on long trips.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, Christmas we drove to California, which is my home,#Statement-non-opinion
and you can take out the middle seat,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they come out fairly easily, so we took out the middle seat, put the car seats in the back and just had a whole area in the middle, like if we were out on open road#Statement-non-opinion
and it was their nap time,#Statement-non-opinion
we just went ahead and laid them down.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, I wouldn't do that if we were in a city, or, if there were a lot of cars around or anything.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it made it so much easier to travel.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
n-, uh,#Uninterpretable
that's, that's our pro-, our, our daughter's problem, you know, 'cause when you, when you get out on the road like that and it's just long stretches, you know, where they just have to sit, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
In town she does okay, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and even on the road she does all right for a little while because she'll sleep some,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh, uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, you know, i-,#Uninterpretable
she, she wakes up,#Statement-non-opinion
she wants to, to get up.#Statement-non-opinion
I know, uh, t-, coming, uh, right around Christmas we were, we were, uh, Chris-, right before Christmas we had driven over to Shreveport#Statement-non-opinion
and we were driving back#Statement-non-opinion
and it was when all that bad weather was, was hitting,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Appreciation
and the roads were all closed,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we were trying to get back#Statement-non-opinion
and it took us a lot longer#Statement-non-opinion
and she was, you know, she was pretty good most of the way,#Statement-non-opinion
but then, get to a point where she just had to get out of her seat and we had to stop,#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Sure,#Agree/Accept
it's a long time.#Statement-opinion
and we got out and played in the snow and put here back in *#Other
and she was fine,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, you know, if we had, if there was something to where she could kind of get up and move around, like you say on, on the highway, or where, where it wasn't,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
wasn't as bad, you know, just for a little brief period of time, it would be, would be okay,#Other
so, I'm, I'm thinking maybe we can, can do something like that later on.#Statement-non-opinion
Ye-,#Uninterpretable
Well that would be good.#Appreciation
we'll see what we can do.#Statement-non-opinion
That would be good.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I gue-,#Uninterpretable
Well, I appreciate talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Good luck in your car buying.#Conventional-closing
Y-,#Uninterpretable
you too,#Conventional-closing
I ho-,#Conventional-closing
.#Non-verbal
hope everything works out.#Other
Well, really I'm supposed to hear today#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I hope it,#Statement-non-opinion
I really would prefer the Volvo, I think, jus-,#Statement-non-opinion
I know it's older than the Regency#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, they're built of that unibody steel construction#Statement-non-opinion
and it would take a hit fairly well,#Statement-non-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you know, my B M W that my husband was going forty to forty-five miles an hour#Statement-non-opinion
and you know, it didn't even bend the frame.#Statement-non-opinion
It bent in the bumper and the quarter panel,#Statement-non-opinion
but unfortunately they think if it says B M W on it that you have money.#Statement-opinion
They don't know,#Statement-opinion

Okay,#Other
I missed a part of it.#Statement-non-opinion
We're to talk about what, lawns and gardens?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, I'm a putterer.#Statement-non-opinion
I chose that topic because I really like gardening#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, well,#Uninterpretable
it's, it's, it's very str-, strange that I got this call because my wife just called me.#Statement-non-opinion
I was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden,#Other
this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall, fall bulbs.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh.#Uninterpretable
We've had a late fall#Statement-non-opinion
it seems like, the weather,#Statement-non-opinion
in fact today it's really warm,#Statement-non-opinion
and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up,#Statement-non-opinion
but you know you need to pretty soon.#Statement-opinion
Well, that's the way this was.#Statement-non-opinion
The, the petunias were really great.#Statement-non-opinion
Our mums are, are beautiful,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I don't know if we, I don't think we've had a frost up here.#Statement-non-opinion
I've been, I was down in for a week,#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't know what happened last week#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, but, uh, it seems like it's, I don't know if it's late.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sort of waiting for Indian Summer#Statement-non-opinion
so I can get a lot of stuff down out here.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I, I enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
We came here, we just moved into this, well, we moved in in November and put all, all the landscaping in this, this year.#Statement-non-opinion
We came from nine years in a condo, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and working in that condo, you didn't have to do anything#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, unless you really wanted to,#Other
so#Uninterpretable
So now#Summarize/reformulate
.#Other
you have the chance to really create and, and spread out.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
You know, I can't,#Uninterpretable
this is my third, third house I think, I've owned, um,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, it's interesting, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
the only problem is that I do quite a bit of traveling,#Statement-non-opinion
and it sort of gets away from me#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you're not with it.#Other
So, but, uh, I, I enjoy most of it,#Statement-non-opinion
and about this time of year there is, it starts getting a little old,#Statement-non-opinion
and I start looking forward to, you know, having other things to do with my#Statement-non-opinion
The grass#Summarize/reformulate
.#Other
not growing so fast#Other
Well, it is, it is for me#Reject
because I've been doing a lot of fertilizing.#Statement-non-opinion
We had a terrible summer,#Statement-non-opinion
we had a drought#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing,#Statement-non-opinion
and now it's really growing#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm trying to establish a good root, root growth#Statement-non-opinion
Um#Uninterpretable
you know, for the winter.#Other
ours seems to have slowed down here.#Statement-non-opinion
We're not having to mow every week religiously#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but we're still fighting bugs, and ready to change some of the, the summer flowers out#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Uninterpretable
I still have caladiums that are pretty, which is a surprise this late in the year.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
Um.#Uninterpretable
But like today, it's eighty-five degrees#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's really strange,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I hear that from, my brother-in-law lives in Plano,#Statement-non-opinion
But that'll change#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
real quick#Other
Well, he always#Statement-non-opinion
We'll wish we'd planted bulbs and pansies already.#Statement-non-opinion
he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here#Statement-non-opinion
and then he calls us,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my gosh.#Appreciation
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine.#Statement-non-opinion
So#Uninterpretable
Well, Texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants, because our summers are so terribly hot#Statement-non-opinion
.#Uninterpretable
and we have ice storms every year.#Statement-non-opinion
And there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
extremes.#Other
Some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that is,#Uninterpretable
I was, you know, I was like conditioned to it#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they, they have to be hardened to it#Statement-non-opinion
that's, that's strange with me.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, you think, Dallas, you know, almost semitropical, you wouldn't have that kind of, that kind of problem,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Well, for the most part we don't,#Statement-non-opinion
but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but the, the ice storms really are stressful on all the, the plants that we have around.#Statement-non-opinion
We've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to#Statement-non-opinion
Really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
oh do they.#Backchannel in question form
and, uh, pittosporum#Other
that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you, you#Statement-non-opinion
I love,#Statement-non-opinion
really take a chance with them freezing,#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I love the, uh, the landscaping,#Statement-non-opinion
like I say, my brother-in-law . I get to Carrollton quite a bit.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I go there on business,#Statement-non-opinion
and I really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens,#Statement-non-opinion
and Texas is,#Statement-non-opinion
D-, Dallas is very nice.#Statement-non-opinion
I really enjoy it there. The landscaping, the homes, the architecture, the whole thing#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
very enjoyable gardens,#Other
and my wife and I,#Statement-non-opinion
Except for the lack of trees, out where we are#Statement-non-opinion
Well.#Uninterpretable
It was all cotton fields,#Other
and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful, we really miss it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that we have, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Ohio's a very pretty state.#Statement-non-opinion
We moved, in seventy-six we moved to Chicago,#Statement-non-opinion
we lived there for five years,#Statement-non-opinion
and I remember the first time I took my wife there on a house hunt,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, we were coming in#Statement-non-opinion
and before the plane landed she looked out the window#Statement-non-opinion
and she said, she said, there's no trees down there.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
this is Illinois,#Quotation
you're not.#Quotation
And, when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house, there were no trees#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
because the farmers had cleared all the land#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and now all of a sudden it was being developed,#Statement-non-opinion
and the first thing I did was planted all kinds of trees,#Statement-non-opinion

So, Utah.#Other
Yes.#Agree/Accept
That, that's, that's the state that got, was famous when they executed somebody.#Statement-non-opinion
Gary Gilmore.#Statement-non-opinion
Gary Gilmore.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
By firing squad, as I recall.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
and we still have a death penalty.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Some,#Uninterpretable
a gentleman, uh, that was one of the hi-fi murderers just had his conviction overturned, well, appealed again.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess we have the longest, uh, running inmates for death row too.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then we had another guy, uh, Ronald Lafferty, that thought God told him to kill his sister-in-law.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
He just got a, a new trial because,#Statement-non-opinion

the judge felt that he was incompetent.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, how do you feel about the death penalty?#Open-Question
Well, I, yo-, you know,#Uninterpretable
until recently I've been sort of,#Statement-non-opinion
could go either way, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it, it, sort of doesn't much, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it didn't,#Uninterpretable
it wasn't a strong issue, um, I guess it still isn't a strong issue.#Statement-non-opinion
But I must say, I find it very silly, the way politicians are running around creating more and more capital crimes, um#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
instead of dealing with re-, you know, the real problems that, you know, that they're, they're getting votes presumably by, um,#Other
I assume they're doing it for that reason#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I'm sure that's .#Statement-opinion
By, by by saying well, this, doing th-, this particular crime in this particular way is a capital crime now.#Statement-opinion
Well, I kind of a-, agree with terrorism.#Statement-non-opinion
I think those guys should be done away with.#Statement-opinion
That's one of the worst,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
crimes in my book#Other
and, uh, drug dealing, um,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
that's close#Other
but, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
terrorism definitely. And#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, selling out your country.#Other
It's not, it's not enough just to lock them up forever.#Statement-opinion
Uh, no,#Agree/Accept
it's got to be something that is going to cost them, because we never lock anybody up forever.#Statement-opinion
Not often.#Maybe/Accept-part
Not very often at all.#Agree/Accept
We've got these guys in New York that, uh, I'm sure you heard about, the ones that killed, uh, the gentleman that came from Utah to watch the tennis#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
people.#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
And I guess they got convicted, the four, of#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, murder.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So you've come to a definite opinion on it now?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Well, I,#Uninterpretable
I've#Uninterpretable
it, it seems like it's gone, gotten carried away,#Statement-opinion
um, and I, I do find it hard to dr-, know where to draw a line,#Statement-non-opinion
and so if I had to draw a line, I'd say just no capital punishment.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't see that it accomplishes a whole lot, whereas I do think that convicting people and, and incarcerating them for a long time, if that could be improved upon, that would have more impact, I think.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
You kind of hate to,#Summarize/reformulate
No,#Other
wh-, what about the argument where, where somebody who is committing one capital crime chooses to commit a, a more serious capital crime?#Rhetorical-Questions
I mean, murder, um, because that one at least, you might escape from because his victim, you know, his witnesses will be gone#Statement-opinion
Doesn't this, doesn't this encourage,#Yes-No-Question
You mean#Yes-No-Question
Uh,#Other
uh, violence?#Other
More .#Other
Doesn't this, yeah, I mean, doesn't this encourage murder, in order to wipe out the#Yes-No-Question
The witnesses?#Collaborative Completion
the witnesses?#Other
Well, maybe it would.#Other answers
Uh, I kind of have a problem with our legal system at the moment, uh, as it is.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that people who, uh, infringe on other people's rights, uh, and screw up their whole lives with rape, uh, child molesting, uh, terrorism, just uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There's just like five things that I think they ought to be snuffed for,#Statement-opinion
but I'm, I'm for it for certain reasons.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think that things like rape, uh, you can't get over, uh, it takes a lifetime.#Statement-opinion
I see,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, so if, if William Kennedy Smith had been found guilty, you believe he should have been, uh, executed?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh, if it was,#Dispreferred answers
A six person jury could have decided either way, of course#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Other
If it was, it would probably have to be a pattern.#Statement-opinion
You know, we have plenty of convicted guys that go into jail and come back out, do the same thing and go back,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, if they're habitual, like three times caught for rape or child molesting#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then snuff them.#Other
Well, the problem is that they've just been let out of jail.#Statement-opinion
Pardon?#Signal-non-understanding
The problem there is that they've been let out jail.#Statement-opinion
If they've been thrice convicted, they should have been kept in longer.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but we don't seem to keep them long enough,#Statement-opinion
and then they learn such bad things in jail.#Statement-opinion
That isn't#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well.#Uninterpretable
a place of rehabilitation.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's, that's for sure.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's a tough question, isn't it, on whether, at what point do they become so detrimental to society that society can't afford to keep them around to#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
keep giving them chances.#Other
Yeah.#Yes answers
Uh, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
so the other question that they wanted was whether the place that we live in, uh, compares to how we feel#Statement-non-opinion
What's the laws there in D C?#Wh-Question

Okay.#Other
Okay#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, did you go to college?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
I did.#Statement-non-opinion
And where did you go?#Wh-Question
I went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, it was Sweeper College of about seven hundred and fifty students.#Statement-non-opinion
I had gone to a small school growing up, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and a lot of my friends went to univert-, University of Michigan#Statement-non-opinion
but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when I graduated and, uh, were looking for a southern school#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, also U of M seemed overwhelming in size#Other
and, uh, what about you?#Open-Question
I went to the University of Minnesota.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, so you're from the Midwest, too.#Summarize/reformulate
I am,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Where do you live now?#Wh-Question
Uh, I live in Texas now.#Statement-non-opinion
Where are you?#Wh-Question
Well, I'm in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm in Austin.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh, my brother's in Austin.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, he lives Lakeway.#Statement-non-opinion
He, uh, had moved, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
we're in Plano.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Uninterpretable
I'm familiar with Plano.#Statement-non-opinion
I visited once or twice.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, Austin is so pretty.#Statement-opinion
I#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I love it.#Statement-non-opinion
really like it#Other
I love it.#Statement-non-opinion
I really do.#Statement-non-opinion
And your daughter is going to be a sophomore.#Summarize/reformulate
That's correct.#Agree/Accept
I have two daughters,#Statement-non-opinion
but my oldest will be, will be a sophomore.#Statement-non-opinion
Is, uh, because you live in Austin, is she thinking about the University of Texas?#Yes-No-Question
She has her heart set on U T.#Affirmative non-yes answers
.#Non-verbal
And, uh, you know, having gone to the University of Minnesota, I know what a big university is like.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, one thing that I did this summer, which I thought might benefit both my daughters is, my youngest daughter got involved in band,#Statement-non-opinion
and Baylor has a band camp.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So she went for a week,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was overnight,#Statement-non-opinion
and they lived in the dorms.#Statement-non-opinion
And I thought this would expose both of them to what it's, you know, like on a coll-, a smaller college campus.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school.#Statement-non-opinion
So, uh, I, I, I still think the exposure was good.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The reason I ask if you went to college is I thought, well, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
what were your selection criteria.#Wh-Question
Did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford#Or-Clause
or, you know, there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Those, and those were several, uh, that we did consider.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, my parents, uh, certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south#Statement-non-opinion
and because I had been in a small school, they suggested that I probably, I,#Statement-non-opinion
when I say small, my graduating class had eighteen in it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
And so they suggested that I might want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of one-on-one#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, definitely.#Agree/Accept
uh, or small group situations.#Other
And I did pick it because at the time I was interested in majoring in biology#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I also wanted to spend one year studying in Europe.#Other
Uh, I had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how exciting.#Appreciation
and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing#Statement-non-opinion
and I ended up majoring in French.#Statement-non-opinion
One of the reasons I picked the school was because they had a strong science department.#Statement-non-opinion
They also had a strong language department#Statement-non-opinion
and I'd always loved working with children.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, and I found that I couldn't fit everything in,#Statement-non-opinion
but because I had had a fair amount of French going in#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was able to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me.#Other
Uh, and so#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that was,#Summarize/reformulate
that was some of,#Other
but#Uninterpretable
That worked out very well for you.#Other
several of the things you mentioned were the things that, uh, our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M.#Statement-non-opinion
He, but he thinks he wants to be a writer#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't think that,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, then he should come to U T.#Statement-opinion
Yes#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Uh, and really his, his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and so he's used to a bigger size#Statement-non-opinion
Large classes.#Summarize/reformulate
and because my brother is there, uh, he would have family, close by.#Statement-non-opinion
So there, there are advantages. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
but I also,#Uninterpretable
because I had so many friends who did go from our small school to University of Michigan, which was so large#Statement-non-opinion
and they really felt, uh, like they were numbers.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I went from a large high school to a u-, large university#Statement-non-opinion
and I#Statement-non-opinion
You still,#Uninterpretable
definitely felt like#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was a number.#Other
Uh, I mean, it is a different feeling.#Statement-non-opinion
But that was, that was my only option.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I mean, I just really couldn't look at anything else.#Statement-non-opinion
That was the one and only thing I could really afford other than a jun-, you know, a junior college, which I didn't want to do.#Statement-non-opinion
So that's how, you know, my decision was made.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, th-, that's certainly,#Uninterpretable
uh, especially today with the cost of college.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean that is a, a major, uh, consideration#Statement-opinion
and I do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools.#Statement-non-opinion
And#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
even though Baylor, uh,#Other
and when you mentioned that, we, we have friends who have children there who just love it.#Statement-non-opinion
And for a private school it is not as expensive as most are#Statement-non-opinion
and it is a smaller size#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I do feel like there are a lot of options.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, it's,#Uninterpretable
but I had been hoping some schools I know give, uh, oh,#Statement-non-opinion
even this year, Jay had an aptitude test, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
What, what does,#Wh-Question
he hopes to be a writer.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
he thinks that's what he'd like to do,#Statement-non-opinion
but he's really strong in math and science, too,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind.#Other
Does your daughter know what she'd like to do?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, she, she has, uh, you know, interests that are just, you know, going in all directions.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, what she talks about a lot is theater which I think is#Statement-non-opinion
okay Bethany, let's be real#Quotation
Uh, she really is, is pretty unfocussed at this point.#Statement-non-opinion
And, I don't know,#Hedge
she's taken a lot of French,#Statement-non-opinion
and she may end up doing something with that.#Statement-non-opinion
And I am a single mom,#Statement-non-opinion
so I've been,#Statement-non-opinion
and I made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married.#Statement-non-opinion
So I'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'm, you know, showing them if you're strong in math and science, kiddos, this is one area where women can make some decent money.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Other
I mean, I'm kind of really putting the practical application, you know, and, and saying, yet, do something that you enjoy.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
By all means, go get that piece of paper, you know.#Quotation
Do you just have one son?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
I see.#Response Acknowledgement
Well, it sounds like he's got some really, you know, good strong ideas of what he wants to do.#Statement-opinion
Well, he, but he has even,#Statement-non-opinion
now that he's in high school, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and, of course, there's, there is still time,#Statement-non-opinion
but he's beginning to feel that, as much as he enjoys writing, he wonders if he can make a living at it.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, it's, the, it's,#Uninterpretable

Well, actually, uh,#Other
.#Non-verbal
I, I don't think I'm in the, uh, majority of, in, in Texas#Statement-non-opinion
I don't think I agree with,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No.#No answers
You don't believe in it?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh, I wouldn't say that.#Other answers
I think I would have said that a few years ago.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
When I was younger I thought it was, uh, a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have, uh, capital punishment#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, uh, maybe slowly changing my opinion.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm not thoroughly opposed to it.#Statement-non-opinion
I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought#Statement-non-opinion
You sound a lot like a friend of mine. A#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
a girl I hang out with.#Other
She has very, very black and white opinions, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
There's no gray in her opinions, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
She, she probably would agree more with you#Statement-non-opinion
but, but I don't know.#Hedge
I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again.#Statement-opinion
I've never had a, a punishment or a, a crime like a murder touch my immediate family#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to, to punish, especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we see that more and more.#Statement-opinion
Like in our state right now, there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, that's fourteen years old.#Statement-non-opinion
What's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult.#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I certainly don't, uh, advocate turning people like that loose.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm not sure executing them, uh, does anymore than keeping them in jail,#Statement-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
No#Agree/Accept
it doesn't#Statement-opinion
but,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
it costs less.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That, that's a factor.#Statement-opinion
And, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to me it is.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I work and I pay my taxes#Statement-non-opinion
and I lived out in Texas for a little while#Statement-non-opinion
and they're#Uninterpretable
and that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia#Statement-non-opinion
I mean you guys are, are a lot more, uh, for to each his own even than we are in Georgia.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part.#Statement-non-opinion
If I work and pay my dues#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then I don't like you very much anymore.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I,#Uninterpretable
the cost is something#Statement-opinion
but it's, but I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
dealing with crime#Other
and I guess I would like,#Statement-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
the European countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment#Statement-non-opinion
and they#Statement-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they don't have a crime problem either.#Other
No,#Uninterpretable
you can't,#Uninterpretable
they don't execute anybody in Britain or France#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either#Statement-non-opinion
and they don't have the crime problems we do.#Statement-opinion
I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess what worries me about capital punishment is, uh, when I see people enthusiastic about it and, uh, uh, sort of bloodthirsty. I think it brings out the worst in the, in the people who do the punishing#Statement-non-opinion
and the, that, that bothers me.#Statement-non-opinion
You might be right.#Appreciation
But it,#Uninterpretable
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
I mean I, I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I would never in a million years want that job#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I do believe it's necessary#Statement-opinion
and I,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
On the one hand I, I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing#Other
and I couldn't pull the switch#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well actually I, wha-,#Uninterpretable
the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it, uh, I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else.#Statement-non-opinion
I think it just becomes a, uh, symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians#Statement-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I would like for it to be settled once for all and, uh, get in the background while the more important issues get discussed, uh, uh,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like I said, some years ago, I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
civilized western country.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now I'm, I'm not so sure of that.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, I, I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and#Statement-non-opinion
What#Wh-Question
nor the other way around.#Other
what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing ?#Other
Uh, I guess I'm, I'm,#Uninterpretable
my view of uh,#Uninterpretable
my,#Uninterpretable
I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and, uh, that, uh, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
costs and other factors justify, uh, uh, executing people.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that, uh, uh, than anything else#Statement-opinion
and, uh, I've also never been a victim although I have some, I have two friends whose wives were murdered#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gosh#Appreciation
I can imagine that, uh, uh, for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case.#Other
Oh yes,#Agree/Accept
if it ever touched my fam-,#Statement-non-opinion

Well, have you ever served on a jury?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I've not.#Statement-non-opinion
I've been called,#Statement-non-opinion
but I had to beg off from the duty.#Statement-non-opinion
And you?#Yes-No-Question
Well, I was called#Affirmative non-yes answers
and then I was not chosen.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
Well, I was, I was, uh, originally chosen primarily, I think, because I was a young fellow#Statement-opinion
and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict.#Statement-opinion
I don't know why.#Statement-non-opinion
Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
it's that the younger they are, they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason,#Statement-non-opinion
and they kind of liked me.#Statement-non-opinion
I looked conser-, and all that stuff#Statement-non-opinion
and they,#Uninterpretable
I don't know what they saw in me,#Statement-non-opinion
but they saw it.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, back to the issue, is, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted, especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun.#Statement-opinion
But, there, too, there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable, particularly, I think in civil cases.#Statement-opinion
In criminal cases, I'd like to see the unani-, unanimity remain,#Statement-opinion
but in civil cases, I think a majority rule by, by jury would be sufficient.#Statement-opinion
Well, uh, could you give me an example of a case where you think that?#Open-Question
Well, in a criminal case, say one in which, you know, there is, like, say assault or some such. I think there ought to be a unanimous, uh, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this.#Statement-opinion
And in civil law there, you know, is such a thing as like, let's say, uh, misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
A majority rule, I think, would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases.#Statement-opinion
I don't know if I'm making any sense or not.#Hedge
Well, I mean, I think,#Statement-opinion
are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more, uh, tangible#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Yes answers
often there's more incriminating evidence.#Statement-opinion
Like, for instance, say, uh,#Action-directive
and also, too, I think I'm, I'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more, uh, serious in a criminal case.#Statement-opinion
Well, do you think that, that in a civil case, if there was majority rule, that it would be easy for someone to be set up?#Yes-No-Question
Um, well, I really can't say for certain, truth be known.#Hold before answer/agreement
Uh, as it stands, there's, there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up, both, uh, in a civil, uh, civil and criminal case.#Statement-opinion
I mean, the, uh, documentary, the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that.#Statement-opinion
You know, I don't know for, if you're familiar with that or not.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I'm not.#Statement-non-opinion
A, uh, fellow when he was much younger, uh, was tried and convicted and sentenced to death.#Statement-non-opinion
Fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, so he served out his, his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system.#Statement-non-opinion
The case was reopened#Statement-non-opinion
and he was exonerated.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I mean, I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
many laws, but little justice.#Statement-opinion
Say,#Uninterpretable
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
and I also think, just like you were talking about before, why you were chosen to be on a jury that, uh, the, just, the process of picking jurors is not always objective.#Statement-opinion
Oh, certainly not,#Agree/Accept
certainly not.#Agree/Accept
And you know, they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this,#Statement-opinion
but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires.#Statement-opinion
You know, the,#Uninterpretable
because you get up#Statement-non-opinion
and, and they ask you a few questions,#Statement-non-opinion
both sides do,#Statement-non-opinion
and then you, you're either challenged which is,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, each attorney can use that as much as they like#Statement-non-opinion
or, I think it's a limit now,#Statement-non-opinion
they probably have a limit now,#Statement-opinion
but, they pretty much go through that,#Statement-non-opinion
and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve.#Statement-non-opinion
For me, it was financial hardship,#Statement-non-opinion
so. But, onto the thing, uh, I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing.#Statement-non-opinion
It was always my impression that the Justice himself, or herself, had the final say.#Statement-non-opinion

Okay,#Other
what kind of puppy you got?#Wh-Question
Well, uh, I think she's mostly German Shepherd.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, she was, uh, uh,#Uninterpretable

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she's only about, oh, si-, between six and eight, six to eight weeks old#Other

She's, o-, I mean she's that, this young#Statement-non-opinion

Wow.#Appreciation
I mean she actually asks to go out.#Statement-non-opinion

And, uh, yeah#Agree/Accept
I was amazed.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate, good personality.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
I can't imagine what, uh, would have been wrong with this dog,#Statement-non-opinion

Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
I had a, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
last year I had ano-, I had another German Shepherd,#Statement-non-opinion
now this one was purebred#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, he, when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, managed to get him to a veterinarian in time,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, and on huge doses of antibiotics,#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
and he actually got over it with, y-, seven hundred dollars in vet bills,#Other
Wow.#Appreciation
um, but he had actually was able to get him over that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then he was gaining weight again, was just getting healthy,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing#Statement-non-opinion
and then he got hit by a Cadillac.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh no.#Appreciation
So, I couldn't believe it.#Statement-non-opinion
That was, that was really hard.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, gee.#Appreciation
And that was even harder for,#Statement-non-opinion
I was on a business trip at the time#Statement-non-opinion
and the dog was being house sit, or dog sit, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so they just felt absolutely awful.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I bet.#Appreciation
And I felt, felt probably worse for them than, than for me#Statement-non-opinion
because, oh gosh they, the, uh, this fellow's wife who was, uh, watching the dog, pro-, she, I think she loved that dog more than I did#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh gosh.#Appreciation
She was jus-, really attached to it,#Other
but, uh, it's unfortunate,#Statement-non-opinion
but now, I've got another one,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable

So, uh, yeah,#Uninterpretable
it'd been, didn't, didn't have one for a whole year.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I had, I had a German Shepherd before this one#Statement-non-opinion
and when she died it just, it just absolutely destroyed me.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean I was just, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I couldn't even talk about it for months#Statement-non-opinion
and so I decided well that's it,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not going to do this anymore#Quotation
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then God gave me this dog,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
My dad's like that,#Statement-non-opinion
he, uh, he had a beagle that he loved#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, when that beagle passed away, uh, he didn't want, he wasn't going to have another dog,#Statement-non-opinion
there's no way,#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

And she, she turned out to be a great dog#Statement-non-opinion

well when, uh,#Uninterpretable
my, my doggie, uh, that we have now, uh, she's, she's mostly Golden Retriever.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The vet called her, uh, a golden mix#Statement-non-opinion

like who knows, you know.#Hedge
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But she's, uh, she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, and her nose is that pink, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she doesn't have a brown nose,#Statement-non-opinion
and her ey-, she's sort of unicolor, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
eyes are the same color and everything,#Other
so. I named her Rosebud,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and, uh, a friend of mine said, th-, she, that she gre-,#Statement-non-opinion
this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had, uh, a pet cow named Rosebud#Statement-non-opinion
and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name,#Statement-non-opinion
said my cow lived seventeen years#Statement-non-opinion
That's not too bad.#Statement-opinion
Golly the Golden Retrievers are good dogs too,#Statement-opinion
they're kind of like, get that permanent smile to them,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
they're always, always happy.#Statement-opinion
I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy.#Statement-non-opinion
And she's so easy going and so sociable,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, she loves everybody.#Statement-non-opinion
And little kids can just, you know, maul all over her,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and she just, you know, thinks it's great.#Statement-non-opinion
This, this friend of mine has, th-, well#Statement-non-opinion
it's the same guy that was watching, uh, my German Shepherd when he got hit,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, went fishing with him on Friday and took,#Statement-non-opinion
he's got a full, a pure bred Golden Retriever#Statement-non-opinion
and then I had, uh, the puppy, a little tiny puppy#Statement-non-opinion
and we went and took the two dogs up fishing.#Statement-non-opinion
And this,#Uninterpretable
they just, they had a ball romping around,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in.#Statement-non-opinion
Getting in,#Summarize/reformulate
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, this Golden Retriever jumped in the, the, really fast moving, uh, river current,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh.#Uninterpretable
Oh, no.#Appreciation
Well no,#Reject
actually he had no trouble at all.#Statement-non-opinion
He first jumped in#Statement-non-opinion
and I,#Uninterpretable
he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't think he'd swum before.#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But he jumped in, in the, the river.#Statement-non-opinion
Did puppy go to?#Yes-No-Question
Well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the,#Statement-non-opinion
I was careful to keep her away from the,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's good,#Appreciation
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the fast moving water,#Other
'cause if she fell in then I'd of been, had to go in after her.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Ugh,#Appreciation
ugh.#Appreciation
And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, this dog, Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now, as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and, uh, actually paddled up against the current and, uh, made it back to the shore and climbed up#Statement-non-opinion
and then,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
he, he jumped in again,#Other
and he was swimming for quite a bit, all afternoon.#Statement-non-opinion
He loved it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Cocoa didn't think too much of it, though.#Statement-non-opinion
She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I pulled her out and, uh, then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so, but, uh, she got over it,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Well the German Shepherd that I had before,#Statement-non-opinion
we, we had a little pool,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, she was, she did not want any part of swimming#Statement-non-opinion
but she liked to, to get in the pool on the first step.#Statement-non-opinion
She'd just get on the first step and lay down.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know in the summertime when it's really, really hot.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've, I live right across the street from a, a big lake here, um,#Statement-non-opinion
it's on Oneida lake#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm wondering if, uh, if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I've got,#Statement-non-opinion
the yard's all fenced in#Statement-non-opinion
so she doesn't run loose,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
she could go in sometime when, if I'm watching her,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
and she,#Statement-non-opinion
oh baths.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh gee, she hated baths worse than anything.#Statement-non-opinion
It was, it was just really a fight to, you know, get her clean.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Have you seen, uh, CANINE.#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
no.#No answers
The movie, oh,#Other
you've got to see it. Especially since you have a German,#Action-directive
it is so cute.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really.#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
and, uh, an part of the, the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, it's just hysterical.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay,#Response Acknowledgement
my my dog, last German Shepherd, it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too.#Statement-non-opinion
And that was the thing I couldn't figure out#Statement-non-opinion
because he would go in the lake,#Statement-non-opinion
it wasn't like he didn't#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
i-,#Uninterpretable
normally, I mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet,#Statement-non-opinion
but if you wanted to get him wet, forget it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well that's how Cleo, w-, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
she'd lay on her step,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but that was, that was the only time she wanted to get wet#Statement-non-opinion
and she didn't want you getting her wet#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right,#Agree/Accept
obstinate,#Statement-opinion
obstinate.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but you really need to see that movie.#Action-directive
I, I w-, we bought the movie#Statement-non-opinion
and I don-, I don't know how many times I've seen it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it came on T V the other night#Statement-non-opinion
and I was watching it again,#Statement-non-opinion
and my husband heard me laughing#Statement-non-opinion
and he said I can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie#Statement-non-opinion
I'll have to check it out.#Offers, Options Commits
I saw the, the, uh, previews for it and all#Statement-non-opinion
and it did look like it'd be a good mo-, movie,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
It is great.#Statement-non-opinion
uh, really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I got to do more, more fun things.#Statement-non-opinion
Well we always wait until we can rent them, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well I'm, uh, I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force#Statement-non-opinion
and so I travel a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh really.#Backchannel in question form
And yeah,#Yes answers
I'm a engineer at, uh at the laboratory, Rolm Laboratory, Griffis Air Force Base, up here,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's how I got into, uh, into the switchboard project and all that,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it's nice having a dog here, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
the,#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
there's just,#Statement-non-opinion
Un-, un-, uh,#Uninterpretable
what's the, unrequir-, what's the word I'm looking for, uh, lots of affection, no co-,#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
unconditional affection from the, from the dog.#Other
that's it.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Really,#Agree/Accept
not critical at all.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
no.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they're really wonderful.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, it's been nice talking to you,#Conventional-closing
we seem to be degenerating here,#Statement-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal

Uh, national health insurance, I think, is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because, uh, the articles that I've read regarding national health service in Canada and England has indicated that, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
what i-,#Uninterpretable
stay, stay in line for, uh, four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm, I'm sort of mixed on this.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that the, the answer may lie in, uh, not in so much a, uh, national kind of medical thing that li-, like England has but more of a, um, national insurance, uh, sort of clearinghouse or whatever.#Statement-opinion
I think that, uh, too many, uh,#Statement-opinion
the problem with, with right now is w-, that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through#Statement-opinion
and, and I think that, I think you, you mentioned Canada.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that they have a system where, uh, they, the government deals with the, with,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you, you go to whoever you want but file through one, one s-, particular,#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, setup#Other
and that way they, they are able to reduce prices because they've, you know, it's, it's all one, one centralized thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I, I think that, uh, again having gone through a period when I was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
if you don't have a company supporting you in the, uh, picking up the major portion of your health insurance,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the cost is p-, almost prohibitive.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
Uh, I, I was listening, uh, on the radio the other day#Statement-non-opinion
and they were talking that, s-, s-, something like this,#Statement-non-opinion
I think they were talking about the fact that, um, the money that could be saved, um, in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider, um, could, uh, could,#Statement-non-opinion
they could make it, i-, i-, provide health insurance to, to people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Uh, we're currently, where I'm working now, under Blue Cross.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I don't know what the total cost of the program is#Statement-non-opinion
but for dependent coverage I'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a, a month or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I assume that probably the total cove-, cost is probably,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
three fifty to four hundred.#Other
They're probably picking up about half of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's a pretty good policy,#Statement-opinion
but if you had something like one of these, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
health maintenance programs,#Other
.#Non-verbal
or one of, whatever the type name is,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
H M O.#Collaborative Completion
H M O, uh, where the, uh, where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest.#Other
.#Non-verbal
If you tried to buy something like that, I'm prob-, it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and they're, they're fairly expensive.#Statement-opinion
I, I, um, I ha-, I was on an H M O, uh, up until last year#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, through work.#Other
And it was,#Uninterpretable
I forget how much I paid a month#Statement-non-opinion
but it was much, you know, is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the reason I, I quite was because of, uh, not because I didn't like it,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I really kind of did.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, the reason I quite was just because the, the doctor a, a certain doctor that we en-, enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that H M O#Statement-non-opinion
so we, my wife decided she wanted to, to stay with that doctor,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, we went to the, to the, the medical insurance that we have at, here at work,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, I, uh, I like the, I like the convenience of the H M O in, in a certain respect because it, uh, even though you're,#Uninterpretable
once you find the doctor that you like it's not a problem.#Statement-opinion
You know, a lot of people complain saying well, I don't want to, uh, have to be told who I need to go to#Statement-opinion
but, you know, if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
Because you can, you know, if, if you find someone you really like#Other
and then, we did find several good doctors.#Statement-non-opinion
And, um, like you say it's, uh, five dollars an office visit.#Statement-non-opinion
And, um, my wife was in the hospital had our, had our daughter#Statement-non-opinion
and I think her total bill was around three hundred dollars#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, goodness.#Appreciation
for everything.#Other
Uh, that included, uh, you know, the doctors, the time, the, the hospital a-, an-, everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Delivery room and everything.#Summarize/reformulate
Delivery room and everything.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Include-, including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay#Statement-non-opinion
but that was, that was still included in that pr-, that cost#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's really nice because they, th-, you know, their, their attitude is different than, than a regular, uh, insurance, uh, health insurance, uh, the, in, in a, H M O, you know,#Statement-opinion
they're trying to prevent a problem by, by keeping the cost down at the front end,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, and have you come in, you know,#Other
they, they charge five dollars#Statement-non-opinion
a s-,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, pop,#Other
you're more willing to go in and try,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to take care of a problem before it grows big.#Other
As to a company's benefit,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because they don't have to worry about going in and, and paying,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
uh, seventy-five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's a,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I, uh, I, I really liked it.#Statement-non-opinion
We both, my wife and I both did.#Statement-non-opinion
You, you don't have to worry about filling out forms, uh, you know, for reimbursement and all or, you know, getting paid eight percent of, of whatever.#Statement-opinion
You just pay the, the five dollars right then#Statement-opinion
and then you're done with it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
But here again the, the doctor's practices in hospitals,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
have gon-, become fairly sizable businesses under themselves now.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, you take a hospital, uh, the physical plant itself,#Statement-opinion
you have to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building, uh, when the e-, rooms are empty.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, they spread the costs out over, uh, all the patient costs#Statement-opinion
and, uh, that's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and, uh, it being,#Other
.#Non-verbal
a four thousand dollar bill.#Other
Well, they, and you know, they're also p-,#Uninterpretable
take-,#Uninterpretable
they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, they, they get a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, people who are j-, just have to be there and can't afford it#Statement-opinion
and so they, they know they're not going to get pa-,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, get money from them#Other
so they,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
have to absorb it somewhere else.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
My daughter and son-in-law had a baby,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
here about, uh, what,#Other
he-, he'll be three in August.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, their insurance plan that they're under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And like she went in,#Statement-non-opinion
she had the baby#Statement-non-opinion
and she was out in two days time.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the, the deductibles didn't apply.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so that's one way, one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by, uh,#Statement-opinion
okay,#Quotation
if you'll shorten your stay then we will, uh, waive the deductible.#Quotation
Right.#Agree/Accept
Our, our insurance is, uh, is doing something similar where they're also going to mor-,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay,#Other
what kind of crafts and hobbies do you have?#Wh-Question
Oh, not very many of those at, uh,#Hedge
sometimes I, I play the trumpet,#Statement-non-opinion

And then I have a five year old daughter#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, how about you?#Open-Question

made rugs and stuff.#Other

Um, I used to play trombone#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know if that was a,#Statement-non-opinion
not really,#Uninterpretable
I don't play it that much any more,#Statement-non-opinion
but I, um,#Uninterpretable
what else do I do.#Self-talk
Mainly do reading.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't have a lot of crafty type things I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, what are some other things you enjoy?#Wh-Question
I don't know.#Hedge
My, my father is in the, in the antique business.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

And he, uh, he goes around to garage sales#Statement-non-opinion
and he buys all kinds of, um, china and figurines and statues and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, there's some stuff that's really for, uh, auto repair.#Statement-non-opinion
It's called J B Weld#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I repaired a, a gasoline tank with it once.#Statement-non-opinion
But he,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
mixes colors in it.#Other
It's an epoxy resin that you mix together.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, cool.#Appreciation
And he makes like,#Statement-non-opinion
the other day he was working on a hand that was shattered on a, a statue that's real small,#Statement-non-opinion
it's like about maybe#Uninterpretable
the hand's about the size of a cricket.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
And, uh, has, uh, like the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking out,#Other
and he was repairing that,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it came out pretty good.#Statement-non-opinion
It's kind of a, kind of a ivory color all over and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, has some age spots in it,#Other
and it looked, you know, just like it, it had been there all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh#Uninterpretable
And he fixed some, fixes some bowls that have the cracks or chips in them, and, uh, molds that in.#Statement-non-opinion
He had a blue, blue bowl a few weeks ago that he, he fixed that way.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It worked out real well, too.#Statement-non-opinion
And then,#Statement-non-opinion
Do you ever,#Yes-No-Question
And#Other
Huh?#Signal-non-understanding
and then he, uh,#Other
.#Non-verbal
he thatches, uh, you know, those, uh, thatched chairs.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Course that's like that, that, uh, hooking that you were talking about.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That takes a lot of time.#Statement-opinion
That's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And he used to paint, um, a long time ago,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think he's stopped pretty much now.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But outside of, outside of art class in, in school, I, I stopped doing most of that, unless I, I mean, like he has a computer,#Statement-non-opinion
and I use, um, the graphics#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, software on that, to, uh, to do figures and to look at things, you know, see how they work.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That sounds interesting.#Appreciation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, does, does he ever, uh, refinish furniture or anything like that?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, yeah,#Yes answers
sometimes,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's not one of my favorite things, especially from the vapors,#Statement-non-opinion
and we had, uh, an entertainment center we did last year.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, we bought it at an, unfinished, uh, furniture place#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
and sanded it down and, uh, stained it and then lacquered over it#Other
Pretty time consuming, isn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, yeah.#Yes answers
But, it's g-, it's nice to have it when you're done,#Statement-opinion
I mean, looks pretty.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sure is.#Agree/Accept
So, I've done that once#Statement-non-opinion
but it didn't come out that well.#Statement-non-opinion
Did you use a, did you use a Zar stain?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, I don't remember.#Other answers
It was,#Uninterpretable
I had my parents buy everything,#Statement-non-opinion
and I ended up,#Statement-non-opinion
it was their table, their kitchen table.#Statement-non-opinion
It came out really dark.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, they had a, um,#Uninterpretable
well I saw the commercial on T V,#Statement-non-opinion
and they,#Uninterpretable
and, uh, and the people at the unfinished store recommended it,#Statement-non-opinion
that's called,#Uninterpretable
it's Z,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
A R#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, it spreads real evenly#Statement-non-opinion
and it doesn't dry too fast,#Statement-non-opinion
so it's,#Uninterpretable
if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And uh, we,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
put, we put tung oil on it.#Other
Kind of made it sticky for a while.#Statement-non-opinion
But after it dried out, it was, you know, it was real hard,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was all right.#Statement-non-opinion
I remember it took me a long time,#Statement-non-opinion
it took me like several months, or several weeks to do it during the summer,#Statement-non-opinion
and then after I got it done it was pretty dark, and ended up not being real smooth looking.#Statement-non-opinion
Since I've moved away they've had it redone.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I kind of, kind of gave that hobby up real quick.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I don't know.#Hold before answer/agreement
Like I said, I like doing a lot of outdoor stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
so but during Four H, I mean they really encouraged to do all kinds of crafty stuff, which is in-, interesting,#Statement-non-opinion
I like that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Were you in a, were you the Girl Scouts, too#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
No,#No answers
well, yeah#Hedge
when I was real young I was for a couple,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
of years#Other
Excuse me.#Apology
So, uh, anyway, it was nice talking to you Dudley.#Conventional-closing
Well, it was nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Have a good day now.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
you too.#Conventional-closing
Bye#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay,#Other
how's the weather been in Plano?#Wh-Question
Basically about the same as what you've probably had.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I don't know about you,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
but I was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm ready for it to come back.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you like the rain, do you?#Yes-No-Question
Well, not the rain so much as the cool, the other mornings when it was like sixty-five when we woke up and sixty-six,#Dispreferred answers
and today I know when I got up that the temperature said more like, close, seventy-nine or eighty#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, are you?#Backchannel in question form
I don't care for that as much.#Statement-non-opinion
You don't#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
are you a summer person?#Yes-No-Question
I'm a summer person#Affirmative non-yes answers
Are you?#Backchannel in question form
I like the heat.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Well, I have a friend who's the same way,#Statement-non-opinion
and anything below sixty, she's just not happy#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but I, I think what I would miss is the change of seasons and all because I know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
my husband's from Nebraska,#Statement-non-opinion
and they have more of the four seasons.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I'm from Utah,#Statement-non-opinion
so, I, I like,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you're#Summarize/reformulate
the four seasons#Other
used to that, too.#Other
I just don't like the cold.#Statement-non-opinion
You don't like the cold.#Repeat-phrase
Well, I usually like it about sweater weather,#Statement-non-opinion
and the problem#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
here in Plano is it doesn't last very long.#Other
It goes from hot,#Statement-opinion
and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer,#Statement-opinion
and then it's cold#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I wish it were several months of that.#Statement-non-opinion
The thing, the other thing is the, I don't like the rain either.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I don't either unless it's like, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
some of my favorite's like a Friday night when it rains#Statement-non-opinion
and you really didn't have anywhere to go,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's sleeping time.#Statement-non-opinion
But if you have to get up and get out in it, I don't like it either#Statement-non-opinion
Well, we have several children that are in sports,#Statement-non-opinion
and so#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on, on, and on.#Other
Well, sure it does.#Agree/Accept
That kind of schedule, you really need a lot more sunshine.#Statement-opinion
I like it better, I think.#Statement-non-opinion
And also the evenings are going to be getting, uh, darker sooner#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
becau-, as it gets cooler.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I did a walk last night,#Statement-non-opinion
and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still.#Statement-non-opinion
Sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler.#Statement-opinion
The thing about when it gets hot here is, I don't like the humidity,#Statement-non-opinion
that part I don't care about.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I agree, absolutely,#Agree/Accept
and you know, it's all relative,#Statement-opinion
because I was from West Texas,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was very dry,#Statement-non-opinion
and so I thought Dallas was awful,#Statement-non-opinion
and I still think so,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was so humid there that your, um, all your windows were fr-, were wet every morning.#Statement-non-opinion
They had to get the#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
squeejies and clean them off.#Other
And when we got back to Dallas it seemed really dry#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
because it's kind of like what you're used to.#Other
But I agree with you,#Agree/Accept
the humidity, especially for curly heads like me.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, is that right?#Backchannel in question form
Yes.#Yes answers
I do not like the humid-,#Statement-non-opinion
Well another reason,#Uninterpretable
well, I guess I can't say that it, I don't like the rain completely.#Statement-non-opinion
We have a little garden that we have#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so it really helps our garden,#Other
and, you know, even, I don't know if that's because plants are just that way#Statement-non-opinion
and they like rain,#Statement-non-opinion
or, it seems they thrive when it rains,#Statement-non-opinion
they just, really,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think so too.#Agree/Accept
I know our grass needs mowing twice as often#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when it rains#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it seems like here,#Uninterpretable
I would like it to rain and then be over, and then not rain for a while.#Statement-non-opinion
It seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern, that's all it does.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
So, uh, but I, I am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
but something like,#Other
I guess my, my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six, and then probably seventy-five during the day.#Statement-non-opinion
Well I like seventies#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like seventies okay.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
are you, do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds.#Yes-No-Question
Oh, I don't like nineties.#Negative non-no answers
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You can give me seventies#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you can give me eighties#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
keep it there#Declarative Yes-No-Question
and I'm okay.#Statement-non-opinion
But when it gets too hot, then it's, that, I don't like that#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I stay in the house because it's just,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I do, too,#Statement-non-opinion
I do, too#Statement-non-opinion
It's just too hot.#Other
and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it.#Statement-non-opinion
But then we started thinking, especially in Plano, the weather is so hot in August, that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Static here.#Statement-non-opinion
That's okay#Downplayer
Um, I've, I've thought about that, too,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, when we take our vacations, we, we do take them in August sometimes#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that we can be away from here#Other
We do too.#Statement-non-opinion
I think a lot of people agree the same.#Statement-opinion
It just really gets way,#Statement-opinion
when it gets way too hot#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Agree/Accept
uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
and we've been here for several years,#Statement-non-opinion
and we've been here years when it's been hundreds#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
now there have been worse summers.#Statement-opinion
In fact this morning when they were talking about, uh, Harold Taft, they were talking about how this has been one of the milder#Statement-non-opinion
Years,#Collaborative Completion
uh-huh.#Uninterpretable
of the summers and milder fall,#Other
everybody seems to be,#Statement-opinion
you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat, because they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're melting,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we're, it'll be too cold,#Statement-opinion
and they'll say,#Uninterpretable
well those are the ones that like the cold weather.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah.#Agree/Accept
He, he always did such a good job, I thought.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
he did,#Agree/Accept
he did.#Agree/Accept
It was#Statement-opinion
A good weather man,#Statement-opinion
it was really a shame.#Other
He didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Anyway, um, I guess it's,#Uninterpretable
It's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes#Statement-opinion
That's okay,#Downplayer
they say when you're done you're done,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Oh, is that right?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah#Other
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
you don't have to wait for them to say#Action-directive
Oh, good.#Appreciation
cut off your time.#Other
You just say, Have a good day or whatever.#Action-directive
Well good,#Appreciation
well, then have a good day.#Conventional-closing
You too.#Conventional-closing
And I hope you enjoy the weather this week.#Conventional-closing
You too.#Conventional-closing

What kind of car would you like to buy next?#Wh-Question
Well, I guess Cadillac.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess that's kind of everybody's dream#Statement-opinion
Well, why would that be?#Wh-Question
Oh, I guess it's a General Motors product,#Statement-non-opinion
and I like General Motors because they're made in the United States,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we've had General Motors for years and have always had real good luck with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well that's good.#Appreciation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If you had, uh, no financial requirements, if you could buy any car in the entire world, no matter what it cost, what would you buy?#Wh-Question
Oh, um, I think I'd still go with the Cadillac.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you?#Backchannel in question form
I don't, I don't care about a big fancy, fancy#Statement-non-opinion
Which type of Cadillac, uh, is your favorite?#Wh-Question
Oh, I don't know.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess the Seville, probably or.#Statement-non-opinion
The Seville.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's a sharp looking car.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That really is.#Statement-opinion
It, it always has been though.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they have been.#Statement-opinion
You know,#Other
it doesn't have the Coup de Ville or the Sedan de Ville squareness.#Statement-opinion
It never really has.#Statement-opinion
It's always had it's own unique look.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I've always liked that.#Statement-non-opinion
I liked the, the#Statement-non-opinion
one year they had, a couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
Right.#Agree/Accept
I thought, now that looks sharp#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that looks real sharp.#Quotation
Well, I think the ones now with all of the, uh, fancy gold lettering#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and all, you know, I think they're very pretty.#Other
And course the top, now the vin-, what is it, a vinyl top, I think those are pretty.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and, uh, the,#Uninterpretable
I, I've never really, uh, I've never ridden in one recently, um,#Statement-non-opinion
but they're supposed to be just real smooth.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just a nice comfortable ride.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they are,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, they, they're just always,#Uninterpretable
they, they look like they're sturdy#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
they look like they're very sturdy,#Statement-opinion
and you don't have to worry that much about, um, getting, you know, hurt like you would in a small one.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Now they've got a unique fa-, uh, feature in them now.#Statement-non-opinion
If, uh, if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed, the e-, the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't come through the, so it doesn't go, it doesn't go through the, you know, into the inside.#Statement-non-opinion
It'll go underneath the car instead.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I didn't know that.#Statement-non-opinion
So that's, that's a big safety factor they've got in them now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I suppose they all have the balloons.#Statement-non-opinion
The air bags,#Other
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The air bags,#Repeat-phrase
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well.#Uninterpretable
So,#Uninterpretable
well that's great,#Appreciation
that's great,#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So you say you've always have preferred General Motors products .#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I, I go for things, you know, built in the United States rather than foreign countries.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Help our economy#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
What kind of, uh, General Motors cars have you had in the past?#Wh-Question
Mostly Oldsmobiles.#Statement-non-opinion
Oldsmobiles.#Repeat-phrase
Those are real nice riding cars too.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Agree/Accept
That's what we have now,#Statement-non-opinion
but of course if I have a choice I'd still have the Cadillac#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I've been very satisfied with the, with the Oldsmobiles.#Other
We've driven them for about probably twenty years.#Statement-non-opinion
Has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra?#Or-Clause
Uh, no,#No answers
the Ninety-Eight.#Statement-non-opinion
The Ninety-Eight,#Repeat-phrase
okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
Well, I don't think,#Statement-opinion
uh, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
the Ninety-Eight,#Statement-non-opinion
now that's got that big V eight engine in it, doesn't it, doesn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Well I don't know.#Statement-non-opinion
The one we have has a six.#Statement-non-opinion
Has a little V Six?#Signal-non-understanding
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
But it's a very good car.#Statement-non-opinion
It's a#Statement-non-opinion
It,#Uninterpretable
had, not had one minute's problem with it,#Other
and I've had, now I have twenty-three thousand miles on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's great#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's great.#Appreciation
That's always nice to get, uh, reliability in a product. Especially when you're spending, you know, anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars for, for a single item.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Other
you just don't want any hassles#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
with it.#Other
You just, you expect it to do its, its job,#Statement-opinion
and I think a lot of, a lot of car manufacturers don't really keep that into consider-, don't take that into consideration#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
They just expect you to buy their product,#Statement-opinion
but that's always been something that's been a key factor in me, is how reliable is this car going to be#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
Price is, is an issue,#Statement-opinion
but it's not the most important issue.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
it really isn't, because now you can get like five year financing on them#Statement-opinion
and#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, um,#Other
but I, I, I would go with the General Motors any time.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I've always been a Ford man, myself.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Backchannel in question form
Yes.#Yes answers
Oh.#Uninterpretable
But that's all right.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well sure.#Agree/Accept
You know, it's American made too#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which is good.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, but I, I've,#Uninterpretable
ever since I guess I, I was growing up, my dad's always had Fords,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, well, I grew up in South Dakota.#Statement-non-opinion
So everybody has a truck#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and my Ford trucks have just,#Statement-non-opinion
I've, I've just never had problems with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I honestly think I would die before my truck would,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
keel over on me.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So.#Uninterpretable
Well, I,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
those are good products also.#Statement-opinion
Um, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement

So, how do you feel about capital punishment?#Open-Question
Well, I, I'm not really certain how I, uh, I'm not certain that, that it does a lot of good. I mean, that it ends up, ends up effectively, uh, uh, uh, avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you don't think,#Uninterpretable
penalties.#Other
Yet, on the other hand, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
I mean, there is things that#Uninterpretable
seems like it's, it's, it's the right thing to do.#Statement-opinion
Now, you know, I mean somebody, a s-, s-, serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns, you know, fifty, fifty children in a school yard,#Statement-opinion
you kind of,#Uninterpretable
I don't know.#Hedge
What about yourself?#Open-Question
I, uh, I have the same dilemma, I think. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it's, you know, it seems right sometimes#Statement-opinion
and then other times, you don't know.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, people, like,#Uninterpretable
I,#Uninterpretable
it's been,#Uninterpretable
I mean, like the Arab societies and stuff end up, uh, having e-, effective, effective punishments#Statement-opinion
and, and they're extremely severe.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I, you know, I think to a certain degree, the reason that it, it doesn't serve as a deterrent, uh, may be because y-, you never know if it's going to be a-, applied. Right,#Statement-opinion
un-, unlike, uh, like in, in Arab societies. If you get, get caught stealing, they chop off your hand#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand#Other
and everybody knows exactly what, what for.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and, you know, and here, with our court system and, and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can, you can kind of always count on the fact,#Statement-opinion
or, or there is a good chance you're going to get off.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
And also, it doesn't seem like it does that many harm,#Statement-opinion
I mean, sure, their life is taken,#Statement-opinion
but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway,#Statement-opinion
so#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with#Other
so it's more of the easy way out than#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Other
some people,#Uninterpretable
making them pay for the con-, for the#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, what they've done.#Other
Except that, I mean, the, the average cost to si-, to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is, is extremely high. I mean, something, I, I was amazed at. Uh, uh, per year,#Statement-opinion
it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
To keep people in jail.#Other
Uh, you know, and it's sort of a sort of a crass perspective#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on the usage of capital punishment,#Other
but on the other hand, uh, uh, you know, I don't, I don't know if it's that is, that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail, uh ...#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
but then again, also, you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, it's,#Other
it doesn't,#Uninterpretable
it seems by, that by,#Uninterpretable

Oh, I know,#Agree/Accept
I mean, you can't,#Uninterpretable

Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Where, where are you calling from?#Wh-Question
Uh, right now I'm in Utah,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm from Plano, Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see,#Response Acknowledgement
uh-huh.#Uninterpretable
So, uh, uh, what are the laws like in Texas?#Wh-Question
It's, Texas is, has, is one of the, one of the s-, well,#Uninterpretable
I guess there is more and more states that are, that are going back to capital punishment.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, Texas has had it for a while.#Statement-non-opinion
It's one of the quickest,#Statement-non-opinion
it, it,#Uninterpretable
once it was, it was reallowed,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it was outlawed for a while, but, uh, by the supreme court, I mean, or, the interpretation of the constitution#Statement-non-opinion
and it seems like everybody stopped#Statement-non-opinion
and then, and then once they sort of reallowed it, Texas was one of the first to, uh, to actually, uh, implement it again.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
They do it by, uh, by, do it by lethal injection.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I'm originally from Kansas#Statement-non-opinion
and in Kansas also, uh, they, they almost immediately put back capital punishment#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, there they do it by hanging.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
Still, uh, they have,#Uninterpretable
I still remember the, the, the movie, uh, IN COLD BLOOD.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know if you've ever,#Declarative Yes-No-Question

That way.#Statement-non-opinion
And they do it that way?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
well, they, they show it,#Statement-non-opinion
not, not,#Uninterpretable
I mean, the, the movie was made in, like, nineteen sixty-two or something like that#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so it's, uh, it's not particularly graphic,#Statement-non-opinion
but on the other hand it's, it's fairly impressive to watch them, you know, walk into the room with gallows.#Statement-non-opinion
It's kind of a barn like structure.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
I think they're there,#Statement-non-opinion
I think that capital punishment is, is, uh, in t-, in Utah also.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not really familiar.#Statement-non-opinion
Is that right?#Backchannel in question form
Are you there in school?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I am.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, but I think they d-,#Uninterpretable
a long time ago, I, I remember my dad was telling me this, I think, that, uh, they do it by, like, a bunch of men have guns#Statement-non-opinion
and one of them has the real gun in it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
has, has a,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Uninterpretable
So they don't know who killed,#Statement-non-opinion
Has a real bullets#Declarative Yes-No-Question
and the rest of them have blanks?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner,#Statement-non-opinion
I know that#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
no.#Agree/Accept
I've always said that if I, if I had to kill and clean and do my own, my own meat, I think I'd become a vegetarian.#Statement-non-opinion
I know.#Agree/Accept
As long as you're sort of safely removed from it, it seems, seems not so, so bad, I guess.#Statement-opinion

Uh, what kind of house do you live in?#Wh-Question
Uh, we live in a one story, just like a style home, you know, the standard Texas, uh, Fox and Jacobs.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
With,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
How about you guys?#Open-Question
with a yard and fence.#Other
Are you in a ho-, apartment or a home?#Or-Clause
I'm in an apartment in, uh, Plano.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they say those are easy to fi-, or difficult to find.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they are, if, uh,#Agree/Accept
kind of depends on what you're looking for.#Statement-opinion
Mine's just a one bedroom place,#Statement-non-opinion
that's, uh,#Uninterpretable
How are rents doing?#Wh-Question
I haven't looked at rents in a long time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, it's hard for me to tell, because I haven't rented in, uh, probably twenty, twenty-five years#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, just,#Uninterpretable
I'm getting back into apartment life,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's,#Uninterpretable
What's a, what's a one bedroom,#Wh-Question
are you in a, um#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
well, Plano,#Statement-non-opinion
most, most complexes in Plano are pretty nice,#Statement-non-opinion
so you're probably in a, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they vary, from place to place,#Statement-non-opinion
it's hard to tell, you know, how well they've been kept up#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
how old they are,#Other
and these are probably, oh, one of the nicest that I found,#Statement-opinion
and, uh, they're almost five hundred a month for#Statement-non-opinion
Ooh#Appreciation
a one bedroom place.#Other
that does get high,#Other
yeah,#Uninterpretable
I mean,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it does, considering that, you know, you-, uh, house payments are,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was going to say,#Statement-non-opinion
not a whole lot more than that,#Other
our mortgage is, is between, depending on,#Other
you know, it drops, um,#Statement-non-opinion
seems like in the last six months we, um, got lucky#Statement-non-opinion
and we refinanced,#Statement-non-opinion
and it,#Uninterpretable
but it was like eight hundred and something,#Statement-non-opinion
but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so that's really not,#Statement-non-opinion
I have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a town house#Statement-non-opinion
Wow, that's a lot for a townhouse.#Appreciation
in,#Other
yeah,#Uninterpretable
in,#Uninterpretable
actually they're near Plano in North Dallas too,#Statement-non-opinion
but I couldn't believe it,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know,#Uninterpretable
But that's what happens when you get up in this area, you know, you got all these companies are up here,#Statement-opinion
and these#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, I guess they know they're going to get it,#Statement-opinion
And then I think that, um, nobody was really buying houses there for a long time there because of just,#Statement-opinion
I mean, we've been in ours for about ten years,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh there's no investment in it,#Statement-non-opinion
you know#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
all it allows you to do is itemize,#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true,#Agree/Accept
you just#Statement-opinion
on your#Other
take off your mortgage interest#Other
on your taxes#Other
and that's about it,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Other
that's really about it,#Agree/Accept
it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
have you ever owned your own home,#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I've owned, uh, several, built several,#Statement-non-opinion
So you know what it's like,#Declarative Wh-Question
yeah,#Uninterpretable
it's like, when you first,#Statement-non-opinion
this is our third one,#Statement-non-opinion
it's not, um,#Uninterpretable
and it's not that exciting after a while#Statement-non-opinion
Well and especially around North Dallas, or at least in Plano area, they, they basically all look alike because Fox and Jacobs,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
suburban tract,#Summarize/reformulate
yeah,#Uninterpretable
we, uh, we lived out of state for a while and came back#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we lived in a smaller city,#Statement-non-opinion
and now we say, Gee, Dallas really is big and polluted#Statement-opinion
Isn't it.#Agree/Accept
I can remember,#Statement-non-opinion
I've only been here eight years,#Statement-non-opinion
but I can remember coming to work from,#Statement-non-opinion
I used to live in Wylie#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I could see downtown Dallas,#Statement-non-opinion
and now there's this brown haze over it,#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's really#Statement-opinion
it's moving north.#Other
it's really sad because they're not doing anything,#Other
well we're getting off the subject, I guess,#Statement-opinion
but just like with housing, I mean, they're not doing anything about pollution,#Statement-opinion
they're not doing anything about,#Statement-opinion
it's going to look like,#Statement-opinion
have you ever been to Houston?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, yeah.#Yes answers
You know, um, I used to think that Dallas was better than Houston because their zoning#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for where you can put a house next to a,#Other
now it looks just like Houston to me.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it does.#Agree/Accept
How long have you been in this house?#Wh-Question
We've been in here ten years.#Statement-non-opinion
Ten years.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so we've got, you know, got some investment in it,#Statement-non-opinion
but, you really don't get anything out of it.#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
you really don't.#Agree/Accept
Were, you said you were out of state for a while, was that a smaller town than Dallas area.#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
smaller,#Statement-non-opinion
we were up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.#Statement-non-opinion
How was it#Wh-Question
My home town.#Statement-non-opinion
how were the house prices up there?#Wh-Question
The prices, actually, a lot better, because Pittsburgh is about the size, I've been trying to think, like a Louisville, or Minneapolis, that type of size.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the prices, what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy-five, eighty.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's really,#Statement-non-opinion
and we didn't think it was that clean,#Statement-non-opinion
but then after you're gone for a while, it looks cleaner, you know#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh,#Uninterpretable
well, you know, a lot of these people that I've talked to that are coming down from, uh, like what I call, the back East#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Saint Louis, whatever,#Collaborative Completion
especially from J C Penney, uh, are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty, hundred and seventy-five thousand dollar houses down here,#Other
and they've wound up getting better houses here than they had there#Statement-opinion
Really.#Other
so in a way, I guess it works both ways.#Statement-opinion
I guess it's,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
but, and here I guess it depends on what you want,#Statement-opinion
you know, here, I got a lot of people that work for J C Penney in marketing#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a lot of the people that came from that area, probably like what you're talking about, they had no, um, they had a lot of property but not a lot of house,#Statement-opinion
and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it#Statement-opinion
That's a fact,#Agree/Accept
but, but they love it.#Statement-opinion
I mean, they, they, they think they're getting,#Statement-opinion
you know, you say, sun room to them, and you enclose and you can sell it#Statement-opinion
I guess that's true.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they don't have to worry about yard upkeep if they don't hardly have any.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a lot of them I know, a couple women that work there,#Statement-non-opinion
and they don't miss, in Public Relations,#Statement-opinion
and they don't miss having a basement to run up and down to, you know,#Statement-opinion
That's true,#Agree/Accept
there's not too many basements in Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
And I said, You haven't heard about tornados#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
How about those, you know,#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
gosh I remember when I was little, uh, we didn't have a,#Statement-non-opinion
I lived, grew up in southern Oklahoma#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, people across the street had a cellar,#Statement-non-opinion
and we never did,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's just like Dallas area, it was tornado alley up there,#Statement-non-opinion
and every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock, four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street,#Statement-non-opinion
and we'd go into the cellar,#Statement-non-opinion
and I#Statement-non-opinion
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to this day, I don't care if I go or not,#Other
you know, if it's going to get me, it's get me.#Statement-opinion
That's exactly, uh,#Agree/Accept
growing,#Uninterpretable
I grew up in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we used to call the basements actual cellars,#Statement-non-opinion
so it's funny to hear that word, because I never hear it,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, it's like the back porch used to be a stoop, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, um, the housing is just,#Statement-opinion
we like the older houses,#Statement-non-opinion
and I don't know if we're going to stay here or not, depends,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, I mean,#Yes-No-Question
You ever thought about building a house?#Yes-No-Question
Pardon me?#Signal-non-understanding
Have you ever thought about building a house?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
actually when we were up north, um,#Statement-non-opinion
but some family things changed#Statement-non-opinion
so we ended up come back down here, and all that, because it helped my husband's work,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, we really would like to,#Statement-non-opinion
but we don't know if we're going to do it unless we stay here, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true,#Agree/Accept
especially when,#Statement-opinion
with T I it's like anybody else, you never know how long you're going to be here, be in one place, you know,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's real tough,#Appreciation
I mean, the economy any more,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I think everybody just lives under an umbrella, the uncertainty with housing#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

you know, it's,#Statement-non-opinion
Do you work?#Yes-No-Question
Pardon me?#Signal-non-understanding

he's working and working to get this big house to take care of,#Statement-non-opinion
how do you manage both of those?#Wh-Question
Uh, how do we take care of the house.#Hold before answer/agreement

I don't have,#Statement-non-opinion
we have some friends that live near North Dallas off of Campbell Road,#Statement-non-opinion
and they have like a four thousand square foot home,#Statement-non-opinion
and she's got a, uh, a live out nanny. Um,#Statement-non-opinion
but any rate, I don't have any of that, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
it's really not too difficult with no children and just two people, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
You basically#Declarative Yes-No-Question
We have a,#Statement-non-opinion
can take care of everything yourself,#Other
Yeah,#Yes answers
we have a dog,#Statement-non-opinion
and we're pretty,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, we're not fanatically neat,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, we keep things up, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
not like where there is three feet of weeds or anything in the yard#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
by the time you need to, um, get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring.#Other
What about home repairs and stuff,#Wh-Question
do you have to do all that yourself,#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Um, no,#No answers
we're pretty much, um,#Statement-non-opinion
we, we've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wall paper together#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you too.#Agree/Accept
and things like that.#Other
Uh, we pretty much hire,#Statement-non-opinion
we subcontract mostly everything#Statement-non-opinion

I mean other than anything that's not a, um,#Other
I mean, I know how to fix a running toilet#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he does what he needs to,#Statement-non-opinion
but mostly if it's something major, um, you know, cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that, we just hire out to do that,#Statement-non-opinion
Sounds like you've already got the makings for being a general contractor,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
no thanks,#Downplayer
I,#Uninterpretable
If you don't wall paper it well together, you should probably not build a house together.#Statement-opinion
Have you ever done that,#Yes-No-Question
I mean, you sound like you may have been a couple one time. *#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I built three houses in my life#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Other
And how'd that go?#Open-Question
Oh, they,#Other
the building process was a lot of fun#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but puts a lot of strain on things.#Statement-non-opinion
Getting to agree to things, I'm sure,#Statement-non-opinion
and I also think that once you get to be, um, you know, certain,#Statement-opinion
when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you start, um,#Other
the dollar value on things#Statement-opinion
You bet.#Agree/Accept
I,#Other
you know, I think people that own homes a lot in North Dallas are very materialistic.#Statement-opinion
Oh, you bet.#Agree/Accept
I know I'm supposed to talk about homes,#Statement-non-opinion
but people that, the people that own them are the hom-, homes themselves,#Statement-opinion
and you know, um, spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies, for custom drapes just doesn't#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, to some of them I guess it doesn't matter, you know, that maybe#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's,#Uninterpretable
they've got enough coming in to take care of it,#Other
I mean, and, and you know, you see a lot of these people that came east from, uh, west, from, uh, from New York with Exxon or J C Penney,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's just a hoot to watch them.#Statement-opinion
Are they, they,#Yes-No-Question
as far as they're concerned, they've come to the promised land,#Statement-opinion
you know, they've got it made,#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right,#Agree/Accept
exactly,#Agree/Accept
so, well was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house.#Yes-No-Question
Oh, yeah,#Yes answers
because you're combine-, uh, confined by space,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, I had a,#Statement-non-opinion
I came out of a thirty-one hundred square foot two story#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, my goodness#Appreciation
house.#Other
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I had room for everything,#Statement-non-opinion
in fact I had more room than knew what to do with.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know#Hedge
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just seems like room, stuff always expands to fill available space,#Statement-opinion
but#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh.#Other
Well, in a way you can travel light.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Other
you can,#Uninterpretable
you know, you lear-, you adjust, you figure out,#Statement-opinion
How is, how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that?#Wh-Question
It's not as bad as I thought it was#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's not as bad as I remembered, especially going to college and living in apartments there, you know how noisy that can be.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
I do.#Agree/Accept
Uh, there seems to be more a mature crowd in, uh, apartments, at least where I am, uh, even though, you know, there's kids all around#Statement-non-opinion
and there's, there's traffic#Statement-non-opinion
and there's people running up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that,#Statement-non-opinion
but still, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Everybody pretty much kee-, keeps-, keeps to their own turf, so to speak.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
pretty much,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, there's never really any,#Statement-non-opinion
oh I remember in school,#Statement-non-opinion
there's just,#Uninterpretable
seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You don't run into that up here, I think, I think because there's so many, uh, professional people, if you want to call them that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that go spend all day at work#Other
and they want to come home#Statement-opinion
and they want some quiet,#Statement-opinion
Relax and try to go to sleep,#Summarize/reformulate
really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Uninterpretable
You see a lot of activity outside, people riding bikes, playing ball, or jogging#Statement-non-opinion
or they're doing this and that,#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they're trying to, to unwind.#Statement-non-opinion
I think Plano in general is getting a little more,#Statement-opinion
well it's gotten so big it's almost a town in it's own right.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's a hundred and what, eighty thousand, something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Or something,#Repeat-phrase
yeah,#Uninterpretable
the price of home,#Uninterpretable
now we paid, oh, we paid, um about seventy-eight nine for our house like I said, about a decade ago, not even, about nine years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
and, I'd say they appraised it,#Statement-non-opinion
it's gone up, you now, maybe like five percent#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it's an investment,#Statement-opinion
but it's something that,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, when you're first married or starting out, you think if you really have something,#Statement-non-opinion
but you really,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just real,#Statement-non-opinion
nowadays, with the way the income tax, I think housing is strictly to itemize.#Statement-opinion
Oh, you bet,#Agree/Accept
and the thing that, that gets me is, uh, you never really catch up, you never really finish doing things,#Statement-opinion
and, uh#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
exactly,#Agree/Accept
we,#Uninterpretable
you're always paying for something.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and even,#Uninterpretable
you know, I mean, like we had, I called them prefabs, just a tract home,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, I mean, we, we had one of their homes that was nicer in Pennsylvania,#Statement-non-opinion
but, um, it was an older home,#Statement-non-opinion
but then, you buy an older home and you're always fixing things up,#Statement-opinion
Oh, you are, constantly,#Agree/Accept
there's always something going wrong,#Statement-opinion
So, you know,#Uninterpretable

And, um, you place the shrimp in the, in the rice steamer,#Action-directive

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And you pour the beer over the top of it,#Action-directive

And you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil,#Action-directive
Okay.#Agree/Accept
and the shrimp turn pink.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Then you remove it,#Action-directive

And while that's cooking, I take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder,#Statement-non-opinion
and I mix it all together.#Statement-non-opinion
And I shred up some just regular white cheese.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And after that's cooked, you take it out and pour this on top of it,#Action-directive
and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that.#Action-directive
And you cook it for another three minutes on high, you know,#Action-directive
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just mainly to melt the cheese and everything, and let all the seasoning melt into it.#Other

You're off of the main road, you said?#Declarative Yes-No-Question

Away from a road, you know, and you keep an eye on her, it's probably okay.#Statement-opinion
I'm just real,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know, I guess,#Hedge
I'm in a neighborhood#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, it's just real tough on animals here, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it gets hard, especially with the cars.#Statement-opinion
Whe-, I, every time I see one run over I just, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it makes me sick,#Statement-non-opinion

except that I consider them my children#Statement-non-opinion

our cats are our kids#Summarize/reformulate

I took a picture of her#Statement-non-opinion
and that was all it, all it lasted for.#Statement-non-opinion
We-, d-, do any of your friends have, have, uh, older children that they do anything with.#Yes-No-Question
Do, do you have friends with older children,#Yes-No-Question
or do they just all have young kids.#Or-Clause
Um, yeah,#Yes answers
all the ones I know,#Statement-non-opinion
my brother-in-law has three young kids seven and on down#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they go on family vacations#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, they go, like to go skiing,#Statement-non-opinion
we-, the, the middle girl doesn't get a whole lot of attention,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, this last ski trip they took, uh, she had in-, contracted chicken pox first#Statement-non-opinion
and then she spread it to her, her li-, younger sister and her brother#Statement-non-opinion
and they got it just at the beginning of the vacation, where she got better.#Statement-non-opinion
So, sh-, not only is she the better skier, but she got all the attention, because she got to go out.#Statement-non-opinion
I think she planned it.#Statement-opinion
She's only five,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think she planned it#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And she got all the attention from her dad.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, see there,#Appreciation
she needed that,#Yes-No-Question
Wo-,#Uninterpretable
oh yeah.#Yes answers
didn't she.#Other
You know, it must be hard when you have a lot of children,#Statement-opinion
I, you know, to ha-, I was an only child,#Statement-non-opinion
my mother was an only child#Statement-non-opinion
so, I, you know, I wasn't raised with brothers or sisters#Statement-non-opinion
and I always got all the attention,#Statement-non-opinion
so I wouldn't know.#Statement-non-opinion
I think I would be extremely jealous, or would have been, had there been another child in the family.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, it's, we can see it work with her,#Statement-non-opinion
Tough,#Collaborative Completion
it must be tough.#Statement-opinion
she's frustrated.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We-, she, she's the middle one?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
So she's never been the only one,#Statement-non-opinion
so she really doesn't even know what it is to be the only one.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's tough, you know ...#Statement-opinion

I'm sorry, um#Apology
That's okay,#Downplayer
I didn't hear.#Statement-non-opinion
hobbies.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Let me see,#Hold before answer/agreement
I don't know if that took or not,#Statement-non-opinion
I'll do it again.#Offers, Options Commits

What are your hobbies?#Wh-Question
I hear you have kids, right?#Yes-No-Question
You heard her in the background#Statement-non-opinion
That's babies.#Statement-non-opinion
That's your full time, uh, hobby, right?#Yes-No-Question
Takes a lot of time, huh.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I like, uh, most sports.#Statement-non-opinion
I like to do that.#Statement-non-opinion
I kind of like to do a little bit of sewing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, little bit of embroidery work, once in a while.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What do you like to do?#Open-Question
Um, I try to do some painting, although I'm not very good at it#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I'm sure you probably are.#Appreciation
Well, no,#Downplayer
not really.#Downplayer
You like it,#Statement-opinion
that's the main .#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I have, you know, I inherited the genes that make me think I'm creative,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but not the ones that give me the ability to be.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
So, I always try.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I, I do some sewing, mostly out of necessity.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I'm making drapes for my house, just because I'm,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, boy, that's hard sewing.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well, it isn't and it is.#Maybe/Accept-part
It is, you know,#Uninterpretable
actually the sewing isn't the hard part,#Statement-non-opinion
it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it#Statement-opinion
Measure it and get it to,#Summarize/reformulate
because you need so much room.#Other
Well, if it, it depends on how elaborate you get it.#Maybe/Accept-part
If you get pleats and all kinds of,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I've been doing that#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
That's a lot of work.#Appreciation
That,#Other
yeah,#Agree/Accept
that,#Uninterpretable
but usually have to do the pleats by hand.#Statement-non-opinion
So that, at least#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I can do, you know, watching T V or whatever#Other
but,#Uninterpretable
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I've, I've gone and, you know, put the needle through my thumb a few times#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
trying to get it through#Other
but,#Uninterpretable
That feels really good.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything, but I, I need to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
To do it,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
I have, let's see, I have a dog, and a lot of fish.#Statement-non-opinion
Keeping fish, I guess#Statement-non-opinion
Keeping fish .#Repeat-phrase
is my biggest hobby.#Other
Well, they're probably easier than keeping dogs, though, aren't they.#Statement-opinion
Um, yes and no.#Maybe/Accept-part
It depends on how frequently they die, and#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
how much that bothers you.#Other
How much that bothers you,#Repeat-phrase
and you probably have to clean out the tank too.#Statement-opinion
That's,#Uninterpretable
you don't have to do as much as, as I thought.#Dispreferred answers
In fact, my problem,#Uninterpretable
I had fish as a kid#Statement-non-opinion
and they always died#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
immediately,#Other
and, what, I'm, what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean#Statement-opinion
Oh, you're kidding#Appreciation
because you have,#Uninterpretable
because they need to have a little bit of the,#Summarize/reformulate
Right,#Agree/Accept
you need to let the bacteria build up,#Statement-opinion
and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance.#Statement-opinion
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I would just take everything out and just like, you know, wash it with scalding hot water#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, no.#Appreciation
and it would kill all the bacteria,#Statement-non-opinion
and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again#Statement-non-opinion
And so you'd have to#Summarize/reformulate
so.#Uninterpretable
start all over#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
to build that up probably.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
So now only, I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
and I don't try and sterilize things#Statement-non-opinion
Don't go through the whole nine yards#Summarize/reformulate
and#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
they kind of need a little bit of that.#Other
That's right.#Agree/Accept
So you've had fish for a long time.#Summarize/reformulate
Well, I've had them,#Uninterpretable
I guess it's been two years now I've had a, a tank here,#Statement-non-opinion
and then back at home I used to have a small, you know, five gallon tank.#Statement-non-opinion
But that never worked well.#Statement-non-opinion
And, *#Uninterpretable
What size do you have now?#Wh-Question
I have fifty-five gallons now. *#Other
Oh, that's a good size.#Appreciation
It's a lot easier.#Statement-non-opinion
Have you ever had it, uh, crack or break or leak.#Yes-No-Question
No#No answers
.#Non-verbal
No,#No answers
not yet.#Statement-non-opinion
Fifty-five gallons, you'd hope it would never do that.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
I really do.#Statement-non-opinion
But, you know.#Uninterpretable
Do you have all kinds of different fish#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Yes answers
I just have, you know, what they call community fish#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
guppies, and platies and, and basic things.#Other
I don't get into the#Statement-non-opinion
Real exotic.#Collaborative Completion
right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
The expensive ones.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they're probably hardy, harder to take care of#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
They are.#Agree/Accept
They're very expensive#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know, when you die, it's like, when they die it's more like an investment.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I bet it is.#Appreciation
You lost an investment#Statement-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Do you have problems with them, uh, the fish eating each other?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
not really.#Statement-non-opinion
Only if there's baby fish.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You always have to isolate those.#Statement-non-opinion
Then you have to,#Uninterpretable
how do you isolate them?#Wh-Question
You get a#Statement-non-opinion
A jar or something#Declarative Yes-No-Question
or.#Uninterpretable
well, no,#No answers
they have breeders.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
It's a little plastic things that sort of floats#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and you put the mother fish in there#Statement-non-opinion
and then it's got like a trough underneath her#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough#Statement-non-opinion
and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so the mother can't get to them either.#Other
And that's, you know,#Uninterpretable
it kind of works,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and on occasion if you get a real small one, *#Statement-non-opinion
it'll fit out the slots.#Statement-non-opinion
It'll go through the slot.#Summarize/reformulate
That's right,#Agree/Accept
so. But, you know, it works, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
That works all right then.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
They don't, uh, want the mothers to be with the little fish either.#Summarize/reformulate
Oh, they'll eat them.#Statement-non-opinion
They will.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
Isn't that odd.#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
You wouldn't think that.#Statement-opinion
It, and it's funny because the one I have, every single month without fail she has babies.#Statement-non-opinion
You're kidding.#Appreciation
Oh, no.#Agree/Accept
All the time,#Statement-non-opinion
and, um, I,#Uninterpretable
and she's supposed to,#Uninterpretable
her variety, it says they won't eat the babies,#Statement-non-opinion
and I've seen her do it.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
And that just makes you sick almost, doesn't it?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, it's ter-,#Uninterpretable
well, it makes you understand that, you know, things are different#Statement-non-opinion
Things are different in the animal kingdom, huh.#Summarize/reformulate
We might, right. We might decide what's proper and what isn't,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, that's the way it is for them.#Other
That's kind of the way they do it.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
That's it.#Agree/Accept
Survival of the fittest or something.#Summarize/reformulate
Yes,#Agree/Accept
because if the baby is strong enough, it can swim away fast enough#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and go hide.#Other
Go hide from them,#Summarize/reformulate
well#Rhetorical-Questions
So.#Uninterpretable
and then, you think, well, how did they do it out in the real world anyway#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Uh, it's been great because we haven't had to use our sprinkler system,#Statement-non-opinion

and so when it throws in a real cool winter, we get broken pipes and, and all that kind of stuff and because Texas is, just isn't built for#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, real cold weather for long periods of time.#Other
Well, it's real dry down there.#Statement-non-opinion
You don't have the humidity either, do you?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
not, not were we are.#Statement-non-opinion
Now in Houston and stuff they've got it, they've got it where no hairsprayer works.#Statement-non-opinion
It's so humid at times,#Statement-non-opinion
but here it's, it's just about right.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, it's pretty dry and, not too dry where, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you just, it hurts to breathe,#Other
but#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we're just about right.#Other
We're just having this, all this rain,#Statement-non-opinion
and late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable.#Statement-non-opinion
Made it,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
muggy, huh?#Collaborative Completion
the humidity real high.#Other
But no,#No answers
I like it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, we're right in a good stop because we're, you know, we get over in the, over the hundreds in the summer,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but it's, it's not, it's a dry heat#Statement-non-opinion
and it's not really as hot and muggy as it would be being over a hundred plus ninety degree humidity,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
ninety percent humidity,#Other
so.#Uninterpretable
See that's what's bad up here is when we do get the real, you know, hundred and the high nineties, we have the humidity to go with it,#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so you're like real mucky#Statement-non-opinion
and you, you know,#Yes-No-Question
yo-, your legs stick together just from walking#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know what,#Appreciation
So, um,#Uninterpretable
So we like it where we're at.#Statement-non-opinion
If it's not a whole bunch of everything at once#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
type stuff.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So. But no,#No answers
it's interesting when it gets really cold here#Statement-non-opinion
and people forget that they're, live in Texas#Statement-non-opinion
and they don't know how to drive in snow#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know. But, uh, I wouldn't trade it for anything#Other
Oh, that's good.#Appreciation
I was born in Texas#Statement-non-opinion
and I visited other areas,#Statement-non-opinion
and I'm just a sun person I think.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I've gotten used to it.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I don't know#Hedge
Well, I guess that's really about all.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
weather is not real hard to talk about#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
It doesn't last real long either.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I thought the weather is the last thing you talk about,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but in this case it's the only thing to talk about.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But, well, Michelle, it's great talking to,#Conventional-closing

Actually, I've been involved in electronics a long time. Uh, in computers#Statement-non-opinion
and I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, up until, I guess, maybe about a year and a half ago,#Other
I got one for my son. A, a Macintosh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, L C.#Other
It's a real easy to use color, uh, computer#Statement-non-opinion
and I got a very nice printer that goes along with it#Statement-non-opinion
and he uses it for his school work.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I've, I'm currently in school#Statement-non-opinion
so I, I've had an I B M clone, I guess, for a couple of years now, which I've been trying, continually upgrading I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh, I've found, I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it#Statement-non-opinion
and I can't really,#Uninterpretable
I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer, uh, simulation or analysis,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, it's pr-, very essential for me.#Statement-non-opinion
Schools have them,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school.#Statement-non-opinion
It's very easy, it's much more convenient to have one at home.#Statement-opinion
Where you going to school?#Wh-Question
At Georgia Tech.#Statement-non-opinion
I see.#Response Acknowledgement
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so.#Uninterpretable
In engineering?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yes, actually.#Yes answers
So that explains wha-, all the, uh, computer assignments.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work?#Yes-No-Question
Um, sure.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I have some games, of course, which I play on there#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, uh, I have a program which allows me to access a, uh, weather data bank#Statement-non-opinion
so I can, like, check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby.#Statement-non-opinion
So, it provides other means other than just strict, uh, you know, computations and so on,#Statement-non-opinion
so. Have you, do you have a computer for yourself at home?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
No,#No answers
I just have one for my son#Statement-non-opinion
and I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
home computing.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Tha-,#Uninterpretable
At wo-, at work, uh, I'm a technologist, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, in the past, have done a great deal of, of, uh, system development just through, uh, software development programming.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, but now I find myself using the computer,#Statement-non-opinion
even the computer at work is primarily a, uh, word processing system#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and a communication system.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you use Email and like that?#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
Emil is, probably pulls down a third a-, of all my time.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's,#Uninterpretable
I, I, uh, I have modem night computer#Statement-non-opinion
so I can log into the sys-, the, uh, network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there, which is, which can be useful.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, yeah#Uninterpretable
that's, that and word processing is#Uninterpretable
while I tend to,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, obviously, I do most of my, almost all of my report writing on, on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's, it's really become, I don't know, really become my mainstay I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
I can't even remember,#Hedge
actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in, in my life to do a, a to do a report. Because my family, when I was growing up, we got a basic computer. T R S Eighty when they first came out.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Huh. Well I'm a old-timer.#Statement-non-opinion
I did my Master's thesis on, uh, a typewriter.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I rented an I B M Selectric.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was a pretty big deal.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It must have been tough.#Appreciation
It's a little bit strange for me.#Statement-opinion
I, I did my Master's thesis, uh, last year#Statement-non-opinion
and I did that on a computer#Statement-non-opinion
and it seems like,#Statement-opinion
I just can't imagine how people did it before.#Statement-non-opinion
It must have been just so much, so much work#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
It, uh, well, you know, it's just, it was just a completely different world then.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, so yo-, you used your son's Macintosh then?#Yes-No-Question
Do you, do you find it, do you like that kind of computer?#Yes-No-Question
I like it,#Affirmative non-yes answers
yeah.#Yes answers
I like it from a distance really.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I see the packages on it, uh, that are available#Statement-non-opinion
and it's nice.#Statement-opinion
I really don't use it myself.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I, when I come home from work, I, I like to stay far away from#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
computers and electronic things#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, so I let my son do it#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, of course, you know, there's, uh, there's an intellectual evolution taking place where,#Other
it's sort of a joke#Hedge
but it's really true,#Statement-opinion
the old-timers, even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like V C R -s and whatnot#Statement-opinion
and the kids, they just take to it like candy.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, i-, if, if, if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge#Statement-opinion

So, how do you feel about our policy in Latin America?#Open-Question
Oh, I'm all in favor of it,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah#Uninterpretable
No,#Reject
I, uh, I think we've been doing a pretty good job, you know, not, uh, not taking advantage of our, you know, of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us, you know, uh,#Statement-opinion
I mean we could direct the government even more than we have been.#Statement-opinion
I don't think we've been doing too bad.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, do you think that's, do you think that's right?#Yes-No-Question
Do you think,#Yes-No-Question
Um.#Uninterpretable
we should direct the government?#Other
Well, I think that, uh, as a whole that the, being that the drug problem, the drug industry can, uh, bring so much money to a country.#Statement-opinion
I think that if it wasn't for the United States Government matching that the g-, the drug, uh, cartels or whatever would control most the Central and Latin America.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Just that, uh, money is power,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, I have a friend that's, uh, de-,#Statement-non-opinion
his descendants are from, uh, uh, Nicaragua and, uh, very,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean it's like his mother, his,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
mother came over#Other
and, uh, he, you know,#Uninterpretable
I just get sorry feelings for people that their family came from there and how they feel about, you know, our intervention and their government and stuff like that,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he, he was all for it because it's just like you say, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
there's so many people there that, that get the kind of control that's bad, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that their governments can become so corrupt#Statement-non-opinion
and it's like, well, you know, I use to feel like,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
well, they, they, should work their way, you know,#Statement-opinion
they should, should be able to work their self out of it#Statement-opinion
or, you know, why, why, why intervene in another country's, you know, problems and things like that.#Statement-opinion
Why, why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that#Statement-opinion
but I think just a lot of times if we don't then, then it, then that influence will affect our country too for one.#Statement-opinion
And for two, you know, that it does help.#Statement-opinion
I mean, you know, I think the people in those country do want our help. The people that are under conditions that are, you know, not favorable to this their rights.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
So,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
But, uh, I wish we didn't have to.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean I'd rather,#Uninterpretable
even if a country chooses a government that's not, you know, exactly the kind of government that we have, you know or, or as in complete opposition to it, at least it's their choice, as long, as long it's one that's, that, that makes since, so to speak, you know,#Statement-opinion
it is a government that stays in power, that can stay in power,#Statement-opinion
but it seems like most of them don't#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
Well, sometimes that's, that's America doing that too#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
we, we fall out of, uh, agreements with certain leaders#Statement-opinion
and then amazingly enough the country starts turning against our leader, you know#Statement-opinion
It's, uh,#Uninterpretable
So you think like C I A influence and our money over there.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
That, and, uh, that and,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Yes answers
America starts talking then about removing bases and, and whatnot and,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
stuff like that,#Other
Or,#Statement-opinion
and people.#Other
or government aids and stuff.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think that has a lot of things to did with, uh, um,#Statement-opinion
Well, then how can you, how can you say as far as like in, uh, Europe, as far as the, the toppling of those kinds of governments, you know, like,#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that was, uh,#Uninterpretable
I mean,#Uninterpretable
I'm, I'm really wondering whether that's going it settle down or not,#Statement-non-opinion
because on one hand you have, you know, that the, you know, the, Soviet Government, of course, mistreating a lot of the, uh, Slovak countries and then,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on the other hand, you have, well,#Other
they, they were feeding us, you know,#Statement-opinion
so, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know really what's going to happen.#Other
But we don't, we're not intervening in that,#Statement-non-opinion
or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing#Yes-No-Question
Oh,#Hold before answer/agreement
Are,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Yes answers
I think we're getting quite a,#Statement-opinion
put it this way, I think,#Hold before answer/agreement
no,#Reject
I think the people are,#Statement-opinion
And,#Uninterpretable
revolting themselves,#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
and we're, uh,#Statement-opinion
See, I,#Agree/Accept
allowing,#Other
I agree with that.#Other
it to happen.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I agree that, that the communication that now, that communication has,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
become so much more widespread and, you know, worldwide that people are realizing hey, we don't have it so good and let's stand up#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, uh, this is ridiculous#Statement-opinion
we're living, with these kind of conditions in a world that's advancing as fast as it is#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, uh,#Uninterpretable
I think people are just saying, no way, we don't want anywhere of this.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
uh, Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive, you know,#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
where it's always the minority that are, are trying to make the country better.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I mean, I don't mean to,#Uninterpretable
well, I guess I do in a way,#Statement-non-opinion
sometimes I think a religion has a lot to do with that.#Statement-opinion
I think that, that, uh, because of those co-, countries a lot, you know, where such Catholic influence.#Statement-opinion
And I think the Catholic religion itself was, was such a dominant factor, as far as keeping the people down,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
so to speak,#Other
I thought,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
it was the other way around.#Other
They were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this,#Statement-opinion
so all the persecution that they're sort of use to it, it's been,#Statement-opinion
Uh.#Uninterpretable
sort of like, you know.#Other
But, but see, but I don't agree with that because the Catholic religion, as far as through the ages has been the rule, so to speak.#Statement-opinion
You know, they are the ones that set, that set a lot of the rules#Statement-opinion
and they are the ones that do keep the people down,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're, yet they're expected to bow down to it, I think that keeps people in sort of line, you know.#Statement-opinion
I don't quite understand that.#Statement-non-opinion
Do they even understand what's being said?#Yes-No-Question
Well, when, when it use to be Latin.#Other answers
I'm just saying,#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Response Acknowledgement
that,#Other
the old church.#Collaborative Completion
the old church.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which it's not that way now#Statement-non-opinion
but I think that there is, just that, I think that it's just Latin countries are slower in coming around.#Statement-opinion
Well, they actually understood,#Statement-non-opinion
it is in America where it was hard#Statement-non-opinion
Latin, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Well, Latin,#Dispreferred answers
is very, very, very close to Spanish.#Other
Uh, they still didn't understand it though, I don't think,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I, I descend from that.#Statement-non-opinion
And I, you know, I don't, can't, I don't understand Latin#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I'm of Spanish descent.#Statement-non-opinion
So#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Other
um, I, I just think that has something to do with why Latinos or, tend to be, you know, the mee-, the more meek, you know,#Other
they tend to be more,#Statement-opinion
like not stand up for their rights as much.#Statement-opinion
They're not really sure of what they are. I don't think.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I never really thought of,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I mean, how,#Rhetorical-Questions
it that way.#Other
can you contrast the Europeans and their vocalism on their rights to, to say the people in Latin America.#Other
I mean, why are they, why are they not as vocal#Rhetorical-Questions
or why do they not, you know, stand up, so to speak, for their rights?#Rhetorical-Questions
I don't know,#Statement-non-opinion
could be the,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
the economic still.#Other
You know, the,#Uninterpretable
there's,#Uninterpretable
the poverty level is certainly, uh, you know, much worse in the Latin American countries.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, you can say that about Africa too.#Statement-non-opinion
I think it has something to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic, uh, country,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and yet, you know, they have the same problem where, you know,#Statement-opinion
Uh, I don't,#Reject
where kings and such,#Other
agree with that.#Other
I don't agree,#Reject
because I think that they are pretty vocal about it in, in, uh, Africa.#Statement-opinion
I think they've made a lot more chances.#Statement-opinion
They, they've, their very vocal.#Statement-opinion
Well, in South Africa,#Uninterpretable
yeah#Agree/Accept
In South Africa I think they are,#Statement-opinion
but yet, you know,#Uninterpretable
So, what's the difference?#Wh-Question
Idi Amin was, you know, in power for so long.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
So what makes the difference between, say South America and the rest, I mean, South Africa and it is rest of Africa? *#Wh-Question
Uh, racial, I think#Statement-opinion
or like you say, maybe communication of knowing that, hey, up in other English colonies, or previous English colonies, everything is equal and yet down there it's not,#Statement-opinion
Yeah. *#Other
you know, I think communication does have a lot to do with it, you know, in education,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
maybe.#Other
I don't know about education#Hedge
because the black community is still not very educated down there.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I think it is communication,#Statement-opinion
it's just oopsy.#Statement-opinion
I think it maybe has to do with a lo-, a lot to do with education#Statement-opinion
because you look at the, uh, European countries,#Statement-opinion
I think they tend to be more educated, much more,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
educated than, than Africa or the Latin American countries.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
You know that,#Uninterpretable
I don't know whether, uh,#Hedge
actually I, I've always wondered whether, how the education system works in the Russian countries,#Declarative Wh-Question
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the Republics, you know.#Other
Well, I know that Russia, they're, they're comparably more, better educated than we are,#Statement-non-opinion
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in our country.#Other
That's good, in a way#Statement-opinion
You know, uh, something we compete with.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, and I've been sort of disappointed how that they, they say literacy rate has gone down, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
that's sort of upsetting,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to think that we're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer#Other
In our country?#Signal-non-understanding
In our country,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that is really upsetting#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, considering it's free, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean good education is really still free.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, that's just it though, good education.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Is it good education?#Rhetorical-Questions
It may be free but is it good education#Rhetorical-Questions
and that's just it#Other
are we willing to pay for it,#Rhetorical-Questions
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all#Statement-opinion
but, so are they willing to,#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh. *#Uninterpretable
pay for, you know quality education, you know?#Other
Uh-huh. *#Other
So, you know, and yet they, yet people get very frightened when they see the Japanese moving in and the Russians moving in certain areas of technology, you know, that we use to dominate#Statement-opinion
and it's like well, you know, they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do.#Statement-opinion
So, you're going to have to expect it.#Statement-opinion
So what you,#Uninterpretable
are you willing to compromise a little and, and pay, pay some, take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education.#Rhetorical-Questions
So, I don't know.#Hedge
Uh.#Uninterpretable
But, I, I,#Uninterpretable

So the rest live in,#Statement-non-opinion
one lives in Connecticut,#Statement-non-opinion

So, uh ...#Uninterpretable
But still sort of up in that general#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
area of the country#Other
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so you can probably see them sometimes.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we see them once in a while, a couple of times a year at least,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the ones in Pittsburg, of course, we see more often,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh ...#Uninterpretable
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
All right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm ready to go.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, uh, what kind of recycling do you have in your area?#Wh-Question
Well, they've been trying different things.#Statement-non-opinion
One, one of the biggest problems seems to be we don't, they don't have anyplace to put some of the things that need recycled.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right now we've recycled glass for ye-, be-, years because we have a glass industry in our community.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, what,#Uninterpretable
which one is that?#Wh-Question
Owens.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Response Acknowledgement
Owens . Um,#Statement-non-opinion
so glass has been recycled for a long time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, we have a cycling area set up here at our house,#Statement-non-opinion
the Boy Scouts have, and they've done that for years.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, the stores are recycling their plastic bags now.#Statement-non-opinion
You can take them back in#Statement-non-opinion
and they have bins to collect those.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, the aluminum cans.#Other
They try to do the, uh, newspapers#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, they had to close their area down because they couldn't sell it.#Statement-non-opinion
They were,#Uninterpretable
what they were doing was shredding it and trying to sell it to farmers for bedding for their animals,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that type of thing.#Other
And that didn't work,#Statement-non-opinion
but, but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which is why they couldn't sell it,#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, because the farmers would buy the straw if it's a, you know, similar price.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
is there anything else.#Hold before answer/agreement
Okay,#Uninterpretable
I think by this Fall it's going to be required that the town of Clarion, which we'll live nearby, will have mandatory recycling started#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
On just particular things#Declarative Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
Uh, mainly the glass, the aluminum, the plastics.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, it sounds like they're doing quite a bit.#Statement-opinion
Well, we're working hard on it because we're fighting also in our area a large hazardous waste incinerator#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which we do not want built#Other
and, uh, we would like industry to do more before they build these big, huge incinerators.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, we, we just feel they should, they should offer industry some incentives to do more reducing of their waste products and reusing,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
them,#Uninterpretable
because some of those companies that are doing it have, save money eventually.#Statement-non-opinion
At first, apparently, it costs more to get started.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But once they get established, then it's a money saving thing.#Statement-opinion
Well, our company does some things, all of which I couldn't even tell you about.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know all of them#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
And what is T I?#Wh-Question
Uh, Texas Instruments.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Yeah .#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Gee,#Other
my, my son works for,#Statement-non-opinion
no,#Hold before answer/agreement
not for that,#Hold before answer/agreement
okay.#Uninterpretable
Excuse me, go ahead#Action-directive
Well, I, I was just curious as how you got hooked up with this, this speech type of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, my son works in, uh, for the federal government.#Statement-non-opinion
He's, he works in a computer laboratory.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he,#Uninterpretable
And, uh, it was through him that, that, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, here at work, um, each one of us has two trash baskets in our office#Statement-non-opinion
and one of those is designed for any kind of paper products that, um, they want to use, you know, for recycling.#Statement-non-opinion
They can't deal with every type.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, maybe you could tell me, what is the difference between office paper waste and just like newspapers?#Wh-Question
Well, I guess I don't know specifically, except that, uh, for the paper that they want to recycle, they do not want any newspaper, um, and things like candy wrappers or, uh, that type of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
I have a list here.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, they don't want lunch sacks or brown envelopes, uh, phone books.#Statement-non-opinion
So there are, you know, a lot of kinds of things that they don't want, but then any kind of computer paper, letters, uh, booklets,#Statement-non-opinion
they'll even take things that are bound.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
Um, and it doesn't all have to be like white.#Statement-non-opinion
They'll take colored folders,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and, uh, even some of those can have plastic tabs on them.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
So it's, it's hard to kind of figure out, you know, which things are the right ones.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
I mean I, I'll frequently have to look at the list,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Other
if it's something that I don't throw away all the time.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um, they do that#Statement-non-opinion
and then we use, uh, different chemicals and things,#Statement-non-opinion
and I know that about how they take care of that sort,#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of thing.#Other
I, I don't know all the details,#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but they're really on top of that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And there probably some other things that I don't about because we're a real large company.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I just don't have contact with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But in our, uh, city,#Statement-non-opinion
well, I live in a suburb of Dallas#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they have initiated a newspaper recycling#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whereby they pick it up from your alley, uh, one day a week#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and all you have to do is bundle it.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, all around Dallas there are a lot of recycling centers where you can take things, sometimes for money#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, but most of those are real far away from like where I live at any rate.#Other
Well it would be inconvenient to, in other words to,#Statement-non-opinion
Very inconvenient,#Collaborative Completion
and, um, it's just, you know, hasn't been very practical to get into a lot of those things.#Statement-non-opinion
If they would make it something where they, you know, would pick it up at the curb or at least make it, you know, down the street and at the corner,#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
type of thing, uh,#Other
more areas where they would pick it up.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that wouldn't be so bad.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, our grocery store, like yours, will take the, uh, plastic bags#Statement-non-opinion
and they'll also take the, the paper bags back.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um, uh, you mentioned the, uh, glass type of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
The reason I ask you about that is years ago, and it, it changed names somewhere along the line, but, um, my dad used to work for Knox Glass in,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, Knox is just over the hill here#Statement-non-opinion
Knox, Pennsylvania.#Other
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yes, uh-huh.#Yes answers
They,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's,#Uninterpretable
they no longer are, you know, active.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they were taken over by Glass Containers years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, but he worked for them for like thirty-one years.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, for heaven's sake.#Appreciation
And he used to travel up there to Knox quite a bit,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and I even did once when I was a child,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, for heaven's sake.#Appreciation
you know, so,#Uninterpretable
Well, we only live probably about fifteen, twenty miles from Knox.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
uh-huh.#Yes answers
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we,#Uninterpretable
I was looking through our photo album not long ago#Statement-non-opinion
and they had,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
had some pictures and things in there of Knox.#Other
I'll be darn,#Appreciation
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, I guess that's about it, you know, as far as what goes on that I know about.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think people are getting more interested#Statement-opinion
and they are more concerned.#Statement-opinion
And we're just, we're just real concerned about this incinerator because we really, they want to put it right in, uh, in between two of our main water sheds that feed the Clarion Ri-, River.#Statement-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
And, uh, we, we just, we just don't want it anyplace#Statement-non-opinion
We feel that we, that they should give businesses more incentives to do more recycling and more reduction and, and more reuse and all those things that could be done.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We, we just don't think, we don't think some of the politicians are really interested in our best interests.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's,#Uninterpretable
And, uh, it's, it's been a real struggle and a hardship for a lot of people in our area that we've, have, you know, have been fighting against this thing in trying to have things changed,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to make them more, more right,#Other
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, I think probably more people, you know, would participate if they just made it a little easier,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and like you say, make it, um, better for companies to do these things,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and get involved in it without huge cost to them,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because obviously,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
no one wants to spend a lot of money,#Other
Uh, well,#Statement-opinion
just to deal with trash, you know.#Other
We're, we're going to pay for that, that whether we pay industry or,#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Appreciation
pay,#Other
we, we've already paid industry for like these super fund that's cleaning up.#Statement-non-opinion
We paid industry for it,#Statement-non-opinion
we pay, all help to pay to have them haul it away from their place,#Statement-non-opinion
and where they put it now they found it's not a safe place.#Statement-non-opinion
It's leaked#Statement-non-opinion
and now they have to clean those up,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's our money that's cleaning this,#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Appreciation
stuff up.#Other
And now they want to put it in,#Statement-non-opinion
they burn it#Statement-non-opinion
and that will make another hazardous dump#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and eventually they'll have to do something with that.#Statement-non-opinion
We'll pay for it again,#Statement-non-opinion
That's true.#Appreciation
so why not pay industry.#Rhetorical-Questions
This is my feeling.#Statement-non-opinion
Why not pay industry a little more,#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and reduce it, you know, and, and not have as much of it.#Other
Also probably look at packaging and,#Collaborative Completion
Oh,#Other
that sort of thing.#Other
definitely.#Agree/Accept
We don't, we don't need three quarters of,#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what we get.#Other
No,#Agree/Accept
but they think, and probably they're right, people buy it easier .#Statement-opinion
I, uh,#Uninterpretable
that's their marketing.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well,#Uninterpretable
And I know people would be willing to do more, like saving their newspapers and that, if they had a place to take them.#Statement-opinion
We don't have anyplace right now that will take them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I'm,#Uninterpretable
guess our city, you know, in picking them up must take them somewhere else,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and get something for them.#Other
Probably,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I don't that it's a big money,#Statement-opinion

I guess you heard our conv-, our topic for today was clothing?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
I certainly did.#Statement-non-opinion
How you dress for work and season to season and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How do you dress for work?#Wh-Question
Well, uh, uh about the same I dress for school.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh, I am a graduate student#Statement-non-opinion
so, I don't have to worry too much about, uh, what I wear too much of the time.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which is nice.#Other
Uh#Statement-non-opinion
You bet.#Appreciation
Uh, uh, although I do, uh, a lot of,#Other
I am a speech pathology major#Statement-non-opinion
and so I do a lot of clinical work#Statement-non-opinion
and when I do clinic work then I have to, uh, uh, look my best.#Statement-non-opinion
Look professional#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Unfortunately.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I understand.#Appreciation
I am a,#Statement-non-opinion
I own my company.#Statement-non-opinion
I am in the, I am, uh, manufactures rep sales organization#Statement-non-opinion
and my office is a small office#Statement-non-opinion
and I am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but then when I travel it is a little different situation.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, suits and sports coat, tie and the whole bit.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Cause you go to meetings and you are required to look your best and look professional of course.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, uh, do you find that, uh, on the average do people give uh, more credibility or less credibility to a professional, uh, to professionally dressed individual.#Or-Clause
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think in today's society, uh, there is more credibility to be quite honest#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I will always remember,#Statement-non-opinion
I will tell this real quick story when I graduated from college,#Statement-non-opinion
my first job years ago, uh, thirty years ago, twenty-nine years ago, in fact, was selling agricultural fertilizer.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I worked for the, uh, Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical#Statement-non-opinion
and I sold uh, you know, manure.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I would go out and call on farmers#Statement-non-opinion
and I would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that,#Statement-non-opinion
but I was calling on guys that wore bib overalls.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so, one day I got up and thought well I will just go casual and you know that I called on a guy wearing exactly that, bib overalls,#Statement-non-opinion
and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he sort of expected me to dress as a professional#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
so, uh, it was sort of,#Statement-non-opinion
Even the farmers.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
You bet#Affirmative non-yes answers
Oh, wow.#Response Acknowledgement
even back then#Other
so I sort, uh, been aware of my dress ever since then and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
try to look my best,#Other
but here again I dress casual quite a bit#Statement-non-opinion
so,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
certainly.#Appreciation
It gives you confidence.#Statement-non-opinion
In my business if I call on the the J C Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago, then I wear coat and tie.#Statement-non-opinion
If I call on just, uh, a normal little dealer of mine, I might be casual.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I call on Oshman's sporting goods, again, it may be casual or it may be coat and tie.#Statement-non-opinion
So it depends.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it depends.#Repeat-phrase
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, so you don't, uh,#Uninterpretable
if you had the choice would you wear a tie or not?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, probably no.#No answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Probably, no.#No answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because, uh, today I believe you can get away with,#Other
but then it depends on who you are calling on.#Statement-non-opinion
Who you're,#Uninterpretable
you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie, you just, uh, he would be missing something.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Although, he shouldn't be evaluated on that.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, it's its' just different.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, uh,#Uninterpretable
if if you wanted to, uh, uh, really get into a hot issue, uh#Action-directive
well at least in some in some beliefs, uh, how people dress when they go to church is, uh, is uh, sometimes a pretty, pretty hot topic.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Statement-opinion
Uh, un-, un-, un-, unfortunately.#Statement-opinion
I am, uh, like a Catholic#Statement-non-opinion
and the people that go to my Church, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Catholics dress very casual#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Other
a lot of the times.#Other
People in jeans and in whatever,#Statement-non-opinion
but yet the way I was raised,#Statement-non-opinion
I am a converted Catholic,#Statement-non-opinion
the way I was raised,#Statement-non-opinion
I was raised a Baptist#Statement-non-opinion
and like as a youngster I use to always dress up all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess that has changed also.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm, I am, uh, I go to the Church of Christ.#Statement-non-opinion
I have been raised in the Church of Christ#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, but, uh, I, uh, too many times you hear you hear a lot about what what you're, uh, supposed you're supposed to look your Sunday best#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, uh, and dress and proper attire#Other
and, uh, and sometimes that really disappoints me, uh, in, uh, when I see in other economic areas like in Kentucky.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, people just don't have that#Statement-non-opinion
and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because#Statement-non-opinion
But .#Uninterpretable
they don't have the clothes to wear.#Other
That is a very good point.#Appreciation
I am from West Virginia#Statement-non-opinion
so I understand what you are saying there#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's it's a very good point.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But you shouldn't, what's the old saying, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.#Statement-opinion
Certainly.#Appreciation
And, uh, evaluation of an individual. Course, all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have.#Statement-opinion
I think you have to dress sort of accordingly.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and, uh, or evaluate a person by that.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What about season to season.#Open-Question
Does,#Uninterpretable
I guess your dress changes.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Uh, yeah#Yes answers
a little bit.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, uh of course in the summer if I can get away with it, I wear, uh, uh, a pair of shorts#Statement-non-opinion
and that's it.#Statement-non-opinion
Run around barefoot,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
no shirt or anything#Other
But, uh,#Uninterpretable

Okay.#Other
What do you think of the public school system?#Wh-Question
First off, do you have children that are in it?#Yes-No-Question
I have children that are in the Plano Public School systems#Affirmative non-yes answers
and I am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay#Response Acknowledgement
system#Other
So,#Uninterpretable
Well then, you should be a good one to know because I, my children are grown now.#Statement-opinion
I now have grandchildren,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the school system#Other
so, uh, I don't have firsthand experience right now,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with it.#Other
So what do you think?#Open-Question
Well, I think the public school systems are doing a good job.#Statement-opinion
I think they have a long way to go yet#Statement-opinion
but I think that, um, they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier.#Statement-opinion
You know, my kindergartners were on the, were on the computers,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done.#Statement-opinion
And I think that, uh, the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them, you know, skills.#Statement-opinion
You know,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you don't just add one plus one#Other
you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together.#Statement-opinion
And I think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think,#Statement-opinion
they literally cannot come in out of the rain.#Statement-opinion
That's right#Agree/Accept
You know, and that just,#Uninterpretable
I don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why I went into education.#Statement-non-opinion
So I think, you know, they're, they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have,#Statement-opinion
and I think that's very, very important.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
it is.#Agree/Accept
I, I agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren,#Statement-opinion
we have a, uh, fourth grader#Statement-non-opinion
and then we have one that's in kindergarten#Statement-non-opinion
and, and I know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing, were doing in the fifth and sixth grade.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, it's amazing,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
to me and stuff that I didn't do until I was in junior high.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which, of course, shows my age.#Other
I tutor a girl that's in eighth grade#Statement-non-opinion
and her pre-algebra book is higher then some of my Algebra Two,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
when I was in high school.#Other
Is that scary?#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
And it's like, oh, I going to take this home and study it before I can help you.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, so they're really, they're really moving them along#Statement-non-opinion
but yet, at the same time, you know, they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life.#Statement-non-opinion
Now,#Uninterpretable
And that's wha-, you know,#Uninterpretable
a lot of the things that we did in school I've never used and never will use.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, so I think that it's, it's appropriate to teach them, you know, why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this.#Statement-opinion
Correct.#Agree/Accept
Are you finding that, uh, since you're doing substitute, that you're wanting to do full-time?#Yes-No-Question
Um, I have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Yes answers
that's a,#Uninterpretable
And, and d-,#Uninterpretable
are you, do you find that?#Yes-No-Question
Well, filling out the forms and also all of these, uh, statewide and national wide testing,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
things so that they compare#Other
and . You know, you can as far as I'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it.#Statement-non-opinion
And you waste so much time quote, unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be,#Statement-opinion
Be,#Uninterpretable
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, that I think it's, uh, I think it's crazy personally#Other
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
You know, the fir-, the whole first nine weeks of school is, is used as a review#Statement-non-opinion
but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in,#Statement-non-opinion
Coming up,#Collaborative Completion
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
October. So that you know, your school district shines throughout the United States.#Other
And I think that's totally useless.#Statement-opinion
I think, you know, there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons#Statement-opinion
but I think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous.#Statement-opinion
It's like bragging on your grandchildren.#Statement-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth#Statement-opinion
and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this,#Statement-opinion
and that's great.#Statement-non-opinion
But that's what they're doing with the school systems#Statement-opinion
and they're wasting too much time on that, I think.#Statement-opinion
Well, I, I know that this again this, this friend,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
uh, is in the Plano School District,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and she teaches, uh, uh, it mus-, uh, emotionally disturbed children.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And she says she has, um, six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And,#Other
.#Non-verbal
she says she's getting very frustrated and very depressed because the school is pressuring her to pass them on even though they're not ready.#Other
But because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something.#Statement-opinion
I didn't quite understand it.#Hedge
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there's a,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Uninterpretable
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
The bottom line is always money,#Statement-opinion

Start.#Action-directive
What kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett?#Wh-Question
Um, th-,#Uninterpretable
well right now they've got a, kind of a central location off of the main highway,#Statement-non-opinion
and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper, um, plastic, um, I think three bins for glass, white, green, and whatev-, whatever other combination there is.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And, and I think they've got a comp-, uh, some kind of container for aluminum.#Statement-non-opinion
Plano's doing real good on that.#Statement-non-opinion
They have, uh, they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which we're supposed to put all our week's garbage into it,#Other
and of course it doesn't fit right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But now we start in May, breaking it down,#Statement-non-opinion
and they're picking it all up.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
So they're going to by,#Statement-non-opinion
and we have to separate our papers, and our glass,#Statement-non-opinion
and then, uh, they have one day for, like, um, oh, everything you picked up from your yard,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we put that in disposable bags,#Statement-non-opinion
and they pick that up on Monday.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's really great.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I'm really going head, you know, completely for it,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it's marvelous.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that's good.#Appreciation
Well, Rowlett had sent, sent out a survey, not too long ago, um, in terms in how many people were interested in having a, a pick up, I guess, on the days they do trash or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
And apparently a lot of people responded to it favorl-, favorably, because they're going to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know how, how soon they're going to do it, or how organized it's going to be,#Statement-non-opinion
but they're, they're supposed to initiate that some-, sometime in the next couple of months.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, does your, uh,#Yes-No-Question
where you work, do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that?#Yes-No-Question
Um, I've never noticed that.#Other answers
We don't have a, a whole lot, because we're in a hospital setting,#Statement-non-opinion
so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria. Um,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your, you know, pop cans, and things like that?#Yes-No-Question
Um, no.#No answers
There's, there's only one pop machine#Statement-non-opinion
and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now,#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh, mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea.#Statement-non-opinion
So you don't have much choice there.#Summarize/reformulate
No#Agree/Accept
Not, not really.#Statement-non-opinion
Well I work at, uh, J C Penny#Statement-non-opinion
and last week they brought,#Statement-non-opinion
they have a sign up that says for one full week#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you bring in your old wire hangers#Other
and they're going to recycle them.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
So it's getting people clean out their closets and such.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then like, the week before that, they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good, bring it in#Statement-non-opinion
and they brought it down to the shelters.#Statement-non-opinion
And, they have, one, two, they have three, I think, that I know of#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for cans for people have pop,#Other
and they put them right near where they have the time cards.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it works great.#Statement-non-opinion
And they have one in the room where the snack machines are too.#Statement-non-opinion
That's good.#Appreciation
So they're really going at it,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it's marvelous because,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is.#Statement-non-opinion
Well,#Uninterpretable
And I think they're trying to, to make some changes.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I noticed at the library or someplace this past, uh, month, month and a half ago, they were having a speaker, um, talk about doing lawn work and, h-, how important it is to, to cut your lawn without a bag. Just to kind of mulch it,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
rather than bag it up, because of a-, all the the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff,#Other
and it's, uh, I guess a lot more e-, ecological to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, did you watch the program the other night on, um, was it SAVE AMERICA?#Yes-No-Question
I saw part of that.#Affirmative non-yes answers
It was good.#Statement-opinion
The only thing I g-, thought, um, that I haven't been trying, is when I, you know, go to take a shower, to save the water,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and to put it on my plants. Which I had never thought about before.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I've already gone to,#Statement-non-opinion
oh I started years ago, I guess, not years ago,#Statement-non-opinion
but, yeah#Uninterpretable
I would say five years ago, turning off my fountain, I mean my water faucet,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the sink when I brush my teeth.#Other
But I didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That was surprising to me.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
I missed that question, totally, I mean really bad.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm trying to think,#Statement-non-opinion
I didn't miss too many,#Statement-non-opinion
I can't remember what my score was,#Statement-non-opinion
but I did exceeding well.#Statement-non-opinion
I was surprised.#Statement-non-opinion
But I didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed.#Statement-non-opinion
That was a shocker to me.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well there are a lot of things that aren't,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm ,#Uninterpretable
that's, uh, one of the things I wonder about,#Statement-non-opinion
uh, one of the questions was, do you think more should be done, or something else.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I wonder about some of the prod-, products that they don't take, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take. Uh, why, why they couldn't do more recycling with those.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I was in, uh, Bizmart the other day,#Statement-non-opinion
and, what I don't understand is there is recycled paper in there,#Statement-non-opinion
and it cost more than regular paper.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
And it was only, I think, uh, forty cents more, you know, fifty cents more,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It upset me to realize that, hey, the recycling that they're going through the expense of recycling,#Other
but people aren't buying it,#Statement-non-opinion
so the cost of it is higher.#Statement-non-opinion
True.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I noticed that about things like#Statement-non-opinion
I s-, I seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and, and lawn additives and that type of thing,#Statement-non-opinion
but the cost is, is like, double or sometimes triple,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what the regular things you, fertilizers and things you buy.#Other
So, in, in terms of that,#Uninterpretable
it's,#Uninterpretable
you know, and, for the environment it's, it's, there's a good reason to do it,#Statement-opinion
but the cost is kind of prohibitive.#Statement-opinion
Now, see that's recycling, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
companies that do at least go into it,#Statement-non-opinion
I'd like to see subsidy by the government or something, or tax-wise or something, heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So that people would use this stuff re-, over again.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's a good idea.#Appreciation
It's like when he was saying, uh, which one was recyclable, which was reusable,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and the recycle ones are better to use,#Statement-non-opinion
but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
true.#Appreciation
And if we're going to really do something, they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it.#Statement-opinion
I had to put my bifocals on to see it#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
That's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf.#Statement-opinion
You haven't got enough nerve to say well, put it back,#Statement-opinion
it's not recyclable.#Quotation
I, I'd heard something stranger,#Statement-non-opinion
talk about bottles the other day on, uh, on the radio station, I think it's K L T Y. They were talking about the,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it's in Canada they're using, oh, recyclable milk jugs, plastic milk jugs,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as a, a reinforcement for roads.#Other
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
For road repairs.#Other
And apparently they, they don't break down very easily,#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they don't expand or, or contract when the weather changes,#Other
and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
You know they're,#Uninterpretable
along that same line, they said they were using, um,#Statement-non-opinion
what is, oh, I know,#Hold before answer/agreement
it was toilets. You know, the old ones?#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Smashing them up, because they're, that stuff there is great for, in road work.#Other
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I thought, well, that's good.#Statement-non-opinion
And then I saw recycling on tires between, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
well, hoses were being used,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, uh, soaker hoses, made out of old tires.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What else,#Uninterpretable
something else was made out of old tires,#Hold before answer/agreement
I was trying to remember what it was. Oh, I can't think of it now.#Hold before answer/agreement
But I was, I was trying to get my, uh, kids, you know, to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And just anything, to, you know, recycle rather than keep throwing it away,#Statement-non-opinion
but my biggest problem is, I take the bags out of the store, buy the bags to bring the back,#Statement-non-opinion
and then I forget to bring them in the store.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out.#Statement-non-opinion
I wish they'd really push this recycling bit, because I never realized, I really didn't realize how much stuff I actually throw away.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I think the, the more people are aware of it, the, the more they'll do.#Statement-opinion
I think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in, in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is, and how important it is to do that.#Statement-opinion
You know what I'd like to see a little more.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't have any little tiny kids,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too.#Other
True.#Appreciation
Because it's,#Uninterpretable
we've all got to do it right now.#Statement-opinion
I just,#Uninterpretable
I really amazed to find out that, what is it, eighty per cent are filled now, in, in garbage fills.#Statement-non-opinion
In five years we're supposed to be at max.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't think I can keep my own garbage.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I might not have that much,#Statement-non-opinion
but I wouldn't,#Statement-non-opinion

Well, how, how do you feel about the immigration laws?#Open-Question
At,#Uninterpretable
currently, I think they are a little restrictive. Uh, particularly for, uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries.#Statement-opinion
Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly the, uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia.#Statement-opinion
I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years.#Statement-opinion
And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction on the, uh, on the Orientals also,#Statement-opinion
but, of course, that's just my opinion#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I know very little about the current immigration laws.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, we seem to, uh, to favor certain, uh, uh, countries particularly South American countries.#Statement-opinion
And, uh, there is no, uh, uh,#Uninterpretable
I have nothing, of course, against, uh, the, uh, the South Americans or, uh, or Hispanics, in that sense,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think we, uh, are more restrictive of the, uh, so called eastern, uh, European countries than we, uh, we should be.#Statement-opinion
Of course, that's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern Europe,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, so I think, uh, you know, the, uh, embargo we placed on the, uh, on the Russian Jews, although we of, uh, spent years and years, uh, lobbying for their release and their ability to, um, immigrate from Russia#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as soon as that occurred, we simply said that, uh, instead of the, uh, hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country, we cut that by, uh, two thirds.#Other
So.#Uninterpretable
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do not quite go along with that,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Uninterpretable
No,#Agree/Accept
that doesn't make a whole of lot sense.#Statement-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
And I still think,#Uninterpretable
you know, again, kind of having, uh, uh, within this century, come from a, uh, an immigrant family, or immigrant families on both sides.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants#Statement-non-opinion
so, I'm a little touchy every now and then about that#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, uh, my, uh, my family is from, uh, Europe from, well, from England and Ireland#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, have been in this country for, oh, more than a hundred and fifty years#Other
Oh, my#Appreciation
almost two hundred years,#Other
so, I don't have any, any, uh, relatives that I am, or, or, uh, several generations back, that I am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family.#Statement-non-opinion
They were all, they were all born here#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I don't have any real strong ties with any, with, with the immigration laws.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't, because I don't, I don't have any personal feelings about them#Statement-non-opinion
and I haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I think in a way, though, uh, uh, I also have, uh, an opposite point of view, which is, uh, although I believe we should, uh, permit, uh, you know, constant immigration into this country#Statement-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I think we should, uh, primarily for economic reasons, I think we should have, um, some quotas,#Other
of course, my family and I,#Uninterpretable
again, again that was, you know,#Uninterpretable
my grandparents came over during the time when, uh, there were quotas.#Statement-non-opinion
So they had to wait, uh, you know, in, uh, certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, you know,#Uninterpretable
but, uh#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I,#Agree/Accept
I think unrestricted immigration, I think, is not, uh, is not best, uh.#Other
Well, I agree with that,#Other
I, I think if immigration was entirely unrestricted, uh, not only would, would the United States become over populated, well, more over populated awfully quickly, I think it, it would bring in a lot of, uh, people that are, run out of other countries or in trouble in, in other countries.#Statement-opinion
I think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their, their brand of crime.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
Well, you know, there's another aspect of this, too.#Statement-non-opinion
They're also, uh, uh, diminishing the, uh, health restrictions which,#Statement-non-opinion
I was not aware, aware of that.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There are, were some, uh, regulations over,#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know whether they're laws passed or, or whatever they're called, uh, just recently, where, uh, people with certain diseases cannot be excluded, uh, from, uh, immigration.#Statement-non-opinion
Age is one, for example,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, recently, uh, tuberculosis, which at one time, if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, they dropped that also.#Other
So I think in, in some as-, some ways we are, uh, becoming a little too egalitarian in that, in that sense,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I think we should be a little more circumspect about it.#Statement-opinion
Again, my opinion#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Think we've talked long enough?#Yes-No-Question
I think so#Affirmative non-yes answers
All right.#Response Acknowledgement

I'm going into all this because I used to w-, I just got done working at a pet shop actually.#Other

Well, the Schnauzer I'm, I'm watching for one of, uh, the managers where I work#Statement-non-opinion
and he's been transferred to Germany for a while#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I'm taking care of his dog#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, and I had just got the kitten when he asked me that#Statement-non-opinion
and he says, well, my dog doesn't like cats,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
and I said, well, we won't tell him it's a c-, we won't tell her it's a cat,#Statement-non-opinion

because it was a kitten,#Other
and, you know, they just, they just love kittens.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They just are fascinated.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So she doesn't know that this is a cat yet.#Statement-non-opinion
That's good.#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
They say ,#Statement-opinion
And they get along real good.#Statement-non-opinion
I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty, he'd flip. *#Statement-non-opinion

that's cool,#Appreciation
that's nice.#Appreciation

She's real s-, sweet little dog.#Statement-non-opinion
She's got a very nice temperament.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, they're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer.#Statement-opinion

You know, the Schnauzers are a little aggressive.#Statement-opinion
They can be nippy.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
shelties are nice.#Statement-opinion
Everybody seems to be really happy with them.#Statement-opinion
They're good temperament.#Statement-opinion
They're a good temperament#Statement-opinion
They put up with a lot.#Statement-opinion
and they, and they just, uh,#Statement-opinion
they,#Uninterpretable
I think they have a good head on their shoulders.#Statement-opinion
I think they have a, a higher level of intelligence than other, uh, dogs that I have encountered.#Statement-opinion
Schnauzers, in particular probably.#Statement-opinion
Well,#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
yeah,#Other
but also some poodles, uh#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're kind of,#Statement-opinion
there are some smart ones out there,#Statement-opinion

Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I g-,#Uninterpretable
it seems the smaller the are, the, the worse off they are#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's, that's, maybe that's, there's, uh, some credence in that statement.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the-, they're bred down so much.#Statement-opinion
It's,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They aren't the best pets.#Statement-opinion
I, I'd, I really don't know#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what the best pet is.#Other
I guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, some people seem fairly well suited for#Statement-opinion
Um, *#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for, uh, miniature poodles and such.#Other

Pit bull.#Collaborative Completion
that are so vicious.#Other
They might,#Uninterpretable
they're actually very friendly dogs.#Statement-opinion
Are they really?#Backchannel in question form
I don't think I've ever#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, they're really nice.#Statement-opinion
seen one.#Other
I, I've dealt with quite a few of them.#Statement-non-opinion
People, uh, customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like, they, uh, fit collars and stuff on them#Statement-non-opinion
and they are, they are just really nice, really friendly, uh, kind of like medium intelligence. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, how do they become s-,#Wh-Question
w-,#Uninterpretable
how did they get their reputation, then?#Wh-Question
Well, because some people, uh, want to train them as,#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really#Statement-non-opinion

so the#Summarize/reformulate
respond.#Other
the poor animal is doing it in self protection.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
Oh, dear.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they aren't, they aren't by nature really nasty critters.#Statement-non-opinion
They are very determined critters#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so once you get them going, it's not good to to deal with, but, they, I, I really like them. *#Statement-opinion
I was, I was impressed by them.#Statement-non-opinion
They're, they're real sturdy little critters#Statement-non-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, just really friendly.#Other
Well, that's unusual.#Appreciation
I was, I was#Statement-non-opinion

Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
After#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right now,#Uninterpretable
the reputation that, you know#Other
they have quite an, uh, uh, notable reputation as far as, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
They picked up a lot of bad press lately.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
they're banned from, in some areas I understand.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, any, any, any pet's going to, can, can be bad if you train it to be that way.#Statement-opinion
You know, that,#Uninterpretable
they must have just targeted that breed and said, boy, we're going#Statement-opinion
Well, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, when,#Uninterpretable
in my hometown, they just outlawed ferrets#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because they had one incident of a ferret, uh, attacking a k-, a child#Other
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in a house.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret.#Statement-non-opinion
The, the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, you know, they should expect something like that to happen.#Statement-opinion
And so bas-,#Uninterpretable
now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, did it attack the child, then?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
it, it bit him.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that was, that was not a good thing,#Statement-opinion
but I think it was probably a, an individual ferret thing, because it was f-, it was a fairly wild ferret.#Statement-opinion
Well, the#Statement-opinion
Hadn't, they hadn't,#Uninterpretable
the people that owned him should have been on the#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean#Uninterpretable
lookout for that.#Other
they really should have, should have expected it.#Other
Um. *#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And taken the precautions.#Other
They didn't.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure,#Other
yeah.#Agree/Accept
It's too bad it happened, though.#Statement-opinion

because then the, the animal's in trouble, and not the person.#Statement-non-opinion

Okay.#Other
Wonderful touch tone telephone there.#Statement-opinion
Uh, what kind of books do you enjoy reading?#Wh-Question

I've read that one too.#Statement-non-opinion
I only had a subscription once,#Statement-non-opinion
but my mother always gave me hers#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I really enjoyed, you know, all the little things that you find out about Texas.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, it's, uh, absolutely, it's great the way that it's broken out and you can, uh, set up little trips and day trips and things.#Statement-opinion
It's pretty, pretty neat.#Statement-opinion
Um, oh, I like photography, um, magazines.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't take a subscription or anything like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, things, oh,#Uninterpretable
being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of, a lot of, uh, building magazines and, and, and plant engineering magazines and, read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, kind of strange because I, it's not unusual to, uh, see, uh, an engineering manual or something laying around the house#Other
and then I'll sit up and read just to refresh, uh, you know, to keep active on it,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How about yourself?#Open-Question
Well, um, I have an interest in art,#Statement-non-opinion
so I, frequently purchase and read, uh, books, mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's great.#Appreciation
And, uh, oh, I guess I like a variety of things, uh, lots of fiction, uh, type books.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about, uh, the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's fairly interesting.#Statement-opinion
I bet that would be, rather interesting.#Agree/Accept
Uh, that's, uh, self improvement,#Statement-opinion
that's, that's alwa-, well, that's kind of a hobby#Statement-opinion
but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, uh.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement.#Statement-non-opinion
How about you?#Open-Question
Um, well I hate to,#Hedge
yes,#Yes answers
I do#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
We, uh, we have these classes we attend, uh, management classes#Statement-non-opinion
and, and they give you books#Statement-non-opinion
and, and the last book, uh, matter of fact I read was, AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht .#Statement-non-opinion
It talks about, uh, who the customer is and being customer oriented, uh, which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, one of its great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who is.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is#Statement-opinion
and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.#Statement-non-opinion
You're my customer, I'm your customer, sort of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the, uh, in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable, talking about, uh, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of, of Pat Hagerty and these kind of, uh, mind stimulating philosophy type.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Which all, you know, betters yourself.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, uh, maybe I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean they are#Statement-opinion
but I don't label it as such.#Statement-non-opinion
Like what for example.#Declarative Wh-Question
Well, I don't know, um,#Hedge
I, uh, have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them, but, uh, I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself. You know ge-, getting your, yourself in gear to, uh, sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Convincing you that you need to get on with it.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How about items like, um, THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, which used to be a big,#Yes-No-Question
okay.#Uninterpretable
Yes.#Agree/Accept
So those are self improvements.#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Agree/Accept
Um, our supervisor, uh, subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW.#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
By a man, man named Doctor Bittel, B I T T E L#Other
and it's a very layman's, uh, uh, approach towards managing different types of people.#Statement-non-opinion
And the very last chapter, and I haven't figured out why that one was last, is how to manage engineers#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
So it's, it's ver-, it's interesting,#Statement-opinion
here again it's, it's casual reading#Statement-opinion
and it's not eaten up with a lot of, uh, mechanical stuff#Statement-non-opinion
and it's really excellent fast reading#Statement-opinion
and, uh, but as you say it's, it's sometimes it's difficult to, to know if it's, you know,#Statement-opinion
I think if somebody would say hey, read these ten books because these are self-improvements, I would probably be turned off to them.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If he casually just walked into it and, uh, put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know,#Reject
I'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen King.#Statement-opinion
That's a little, little heavy for me.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they're, uh, quite, uh, they're hard to set down because it's so interesting#Statement-opinion
and, of course, they're all just a little spookier than the movies,#Statement-opinion
but, uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's always, they're always challenging to get through one of them.#Other
I have a hard time finishing books.#Statement-non-opinion
Well I guess I also have been reading, uh, a lot of things on, uh, quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot at work.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In quality, especially now days, uh, that's almost everything that comes across the, the, the airways .#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other#Statement-opinion
but, uh,#Statement-opinion
Exactly, exactly right.#Agree/Accept
I think sometimes the word is a little over used#Other
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah, we, we have, I think we, we name drop it a little too much and, and don't fully understand what, what it is we're saying.#Statement-opinion
I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk#Statement-opinion
and, and all that kind of rolls in together there,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, that's just kind of part of it.#Statement-opinion
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, any other comments.#Yes-No-Question
Uh, not that I can think of.#Negative non-no answers
Um, I think I'm under my quota a little bit.#Statement-opinion
I need to probably make a phone call or two#Statement-non-opinion
Well we just started,#Statement-non-opinion
right.#Uninterpretable
Uh, this is true.#Agree/Accept
I've enjoyed it.#Conventional-closing

Um, tell me some about your camping experiences, Carolyn.#Action-directive
Well, um, I have gone to girl's camp a few times, as a, you know, a chaperon or a leader, whatever#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
and, uh, I enjoy camping.#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
we ha-, we have a tent,#Statement-non-opinion
and we've gone, even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess our, our, my biggest memory is when we froze to death#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
We just didn't take enough blankets and#Statement-non-opinion
Wh-,#Wh-Question
whatever.#Other
where do you go camping at around here?#Other
Uh, we went camping at, uh, Lake Bonham, which is, is pretty close here. Um,#Statement-non-opinion
we went fairly early in the season for this area, which is probably April#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
is when we went,#Other
and, and it got really cold at night,#Statement-non-opinion
and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the morning,#Other
but,#Uninterpretable
Uh, what, uh, what activities do you do when you're camping?#Wh-Question
Oh, we take little nature hikes#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, uh, we take along games that we can play with the, with the kids, and just that kind of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Usually try to have a, uh, occasionally a camp fire at night, you know, and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
roast the marshmallows and what all.#Other
Well, that sounds like fun.#Statement-opinion
I, uh, I grew up in South Dakota, up in the Black Hills#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so we used to go camping,#Statement-non-opinion
my dad would take us,#Statement-non-opinion
there was, there was four of us kids,#Statement-non-opinion
we'd, he'd take us,#Statement-non-opinion
and we'd all go camping, my dad and my mom and, and the kids,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was always fun, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
because what I always remember is, my dad would let us pick our camp spot#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, he'd always tell us, you know, okay, look for, you know, a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents,#Statement-non-opinion
and it always had to be somewhere near a, a river so we could go fishing,#Statement-non-opinion
and hopefully we'd catch our supper,#Statement-non-opinion
but we never did#Statement-non-opinion
Um.#Uninterpretable
but it was, it was always fun.#Statement-non-opinion
We'd always,#Statement-non-opinion
Mom was always prepared#Statement-non-opinion
and she'd bring along, you know, something, because tradition had it we would never catch anything,#Statement-non-opinion
so we always had,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
something along to eat,#Other
but then we'd roast, roast marshmallows,#Statement-non-opinion
and it, it was always an enjoyable experience.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, about nineteen eighty-two I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills,#Statement-non-opinion
I crossed the state to, to Aberdeen,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, there's no hills,#Statement-non-opinion
it's flat,#Statement-non-opinion
and then I was in high school,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, couple of friends, couple of my high school friends and I, we'd go camping out by a river, of course, and, and go fishing,#Statement-non-opinion
but by then, of course, I was able to catch, uh, catch some things,#Statement-non-opinion
but, it, it was always fun.#Statement-non-opinion
It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, in the hills we, we would do like you di-, you folks did, you folks did, would take the nature hikes and, you know, and look for animals,#Statement-non-opinion
and we always, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
in the hills, you can see quite a few different animals,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Uh,#Uninterpretable
Go ahead.#Action-directive
We used to live in Utah#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, of course, there's lots of mountains around there to camp in, and, and streams and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
That's, that's a great place to go camping,#Statement-opinion
and the hiking is just really great.#Statement-opinion
You know, hike up those mountains#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is just really fantastic. Um.#Other
Now is there anything, uh, are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area.#Yes-No-Question
I'm not acquainted with any, you know,#Negative non-no answers
I,#Uninterpretable
there's woods and things out in East Texas#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Tyler area, you know,#Other
there's a Tyler State Park that's, uh, really a nice camping area,#Statement-opinion
but it, it's just a lot of trees,#Statement-non-opinion
it's not,#Uninterpretable
I don't know of any place in Texas that has, uh, really big, you know, what I call mountains#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
The Rocky Mountains are so much, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
bigger than anything that they've#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they've got down here that,#Other
Is the one in Tyler, has it been pretty commercialized, I suppose?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
it's not, well, it's not too bad.#Statement-non-opinion
They have, um, screened in areas, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
they're not really cabins, I wouldn't say,#Statement-non-opinion
I guess they could call them that, but they're, they're more just a screened in, uh, camping area#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
whatever,#Other
they're, they're not bad.#Statement-opinion
Helps, helps keep the, the pests out, I suppose.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah#Yes answers
Well, that sounds,#Uninterpretable
I don't know if I can rate camping,#Hedge
but, you know, it sure beats driving a thousand miles, to to find a mountain, I guess.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Statement-opinion
I, I take it you haven't done a whole lot of camping in this area.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
we just moved down in, in June.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, you're still, uh, get-, you're just trying to get over the culture shock still#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I'm still trying to find my way around.#Statement-non-opinion
I, if I#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
can get on Central from anywhere, I'm happy.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring, and, in, in the fall.#Statement-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, there's, there's a lot,#Uninterpretable

All right,#Other
well.#Uninterpretable
Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
or probably should be done about it.#Other
Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, the short term, the recession is getting, getting top attention.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I think that you're absolutely right there.#Statement-opinion
The other thing is, is that we've got these, um, these, all these bank defaults going on, and, and savings and loan defaults, and, and, uh, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
And that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Exactly. Um,#Agree/Accept
And that's got to be paid.#Statement-opinion
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
and, and, uh, so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come.#Statement-opinion
Um, I'm not really, uh, sure that I even understand why the administration is proposing, for instance, tax reductions, because it seems to me that if, if, if they're talking about reducing, uh, the tax that needs to be paid, or the tax that's currently being paid, then that can't, it seems to me it can't possibly, you know, help with the, the deficit picture.#Statement-non-opinion
It can only hurt the deficit picture.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
Um, and the, the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without, uh, bringing on, on serious problems for the longer term.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
So that, that, that's the current predicament.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it see-, seems like it's, it's a kind of a Catch Twenty-two.#Statement-opinion
I mean, it's, it's the, um,#Uninterpretable
my understanding is what they're try-, what, what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy, the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes, they'll have more money to spend, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and if they have more money to spend, then that will be a spur to productivity, particularly commercial productivity, uh, which in turn will generate revenue.#Statement-non-opinion
But it, it seems like, like, uh, it's sort of a, uh, a sp-, an unending spiral,#Statement-opinion
and it, it, it, uh,#Uninterpretable
I'm, I'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the, uh, the idea that, that, uh, that decreasing taxes, particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to, uh, result in substantial amounts of money, you know, for consumers to spend.#Statement-non-opinion
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I'm not sure how I feel about paying on the quest, the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point.#Statement-non-opinion
It's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it, uh, it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do.#Statement-opinion
Well, well, first of all you look to the Fed to fight the recession#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as indeed it has, with interest rates.#Other
Uh-huh.#Agree/Accept
I think that's been a positive development.#Statement-opinion
I think what that's done is it's, it's, it's help keep inflation from, um, uh,#Statement-opinion
Well, at the moment we're doing very well on inflation.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
That's the sort of upside to the deficit.#Statement-opinion
It's a sort of a piece of luck.#Statement-opinion
That's the upside to the recession.#Statement-opinion
Yeah, um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know,#Hedge
what kind of things do you think can be done in, in, uh, in the long term?#Wh-Question
Well, can be done or will be done are two different things.#Statement-opinion
Um, at various places to look for, for cutting the budget, first of all I consider more defense cuts than are already planned#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
depending on the world situation.#Other
But there are various other areas such as, as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed.#Statement-opinion
Uh, a lot of entitlement programs, like education aid, I think, uh, they should put a, in#Statement-opinion
the Reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but left them for the middle class, uh,#Other
in the longer term, uh, we, we, we'd do well, I think to make, to make, uh, reductions there.#Statement-opinion
Also somewhat is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
I think that, I think that, that I agree with you certainly in the second situation,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think certain entitlements I, I'm inclined to agree with you, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Education happens to be one place where I think that we would foolish to um, uh,#Statement-opinion
A lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which are sort of not colleges#Other
but schools that teach you trades, you know, beautician#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see, I see what you're saying.#Response Acknowledgement
well, and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition, uh, and the school gets paid off immediately, uh#Other
And then they#Statement-opinion
and then they don't provide very much education.#Collaborative Completion
and then the people default#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
on the loans.#Other
Well, I would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that, uh, around, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I, I can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing,#Statement-non-opinion
but, but taking what you're saying at face value, then I would have to agree with completely.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

Uh, do you have a pet Randy?#Yes-No-Question

it, it's actually my wife's dog, uh, I, I became part owner six months ago when we got married,#Statement-non-opinion

Well that's understandable,#Appreciation

it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
You know, the first time I brought her home, she was only, uh, was it six weeks old.#Statement-non-opinion

But, uh, next morning, she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom.#Statement-non-opinion

I can honestly say we do, uh, we, uh, just recently put a security system in our house#Statement-non-opinion
and so now, uh, in order to, uh, to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her, uh, uh, locked up in the, the master bedroom during the day#Statement-non-opinion

Oh wow.#Appreciation
But, uh, I do make her come in.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I feed her indoors, that's to lure her in,#Statement-non-opinion

but adults, if they're strange to her, or, or they look suspicious or something, boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off.#Statement-non-opinion
Wow.#Appreciation
And I have not discovered yet where the, the line is between children and adults.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's interesting.#Appreciation
But, uh, she is a great comfort to me.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know our dog has had, uh, some different reactions,#Statement-non-opinion
she's never really been around children#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, if, if the child is, is pretty straight forward, um, she's fine.#Statement-non-opinion
If, if a child is a little intimidated, she'll jump around and, and yip and bark quite a bit,#Statement-non-opinion
and if the child gets scared, uh, she's still trying to play, but she doesn't completely understand what's going on#Statement-non-opinion
and we've had a little confusion with, with, uh, with younger kids.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, you know, that's,#Uninterpretable
it's a matter of exposure really.#Statement-opinion
Um, we, uh, took her home to, uh, my family's place in South Dakota,#Statement-non-opinion
and she was the one that was intimidated then.#Statement-non-opinion
There was about seven kids ranging from about, uh, three years to ten years running around the house all at one time,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know come to visit Grandpa and Grandma#Other
and, the dog kind of, kind of felt out of place then because she was, she was being fed, and everything else from all directions.#Statement-non-opinion
She really didn't know how to handle herself.#Statement-non-opinion
You mean she didn't appreciate all that attention.#Summarize/reformulate
She really did,#Reject
she just, uh,#Uninterpretable
she, she was alm-, she was just inundated with, with all the attention.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, she, she kind of, she kind of sat and it all in for a little while#Statement-non-opinion
and then she'd go get back in and try to play and, and what not,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, it was, it was just such a, such a new experience for her.#Statement-non-opinion
She's only been around one and, and sometimes two people at the most#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What's her name by the way?#Wh-Question
Uh, pardon?#Signal-non-understanding
What, what do you call the dog?#Wh-Question
Oh, it's, uh, Mitzi.#Statement-non-opinion
Mitzi.#Repeat-phrase
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Mine is Gin.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
As in, uh, martini.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Actually, it's Gin two.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I see.#Response Acknowledgement
Because, uh, when I was a teenager, in high school, I had Gin one,#Statement-non-opinion
but then when I went out in the world, I couldn't take her with me.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I had, uh, a similar, uh, experience.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I grew up on a farm#Statement-non-opinion
so I always had, uh, outdoor pets#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, the dog I had when I moved to Dallas about five years ago was a, uh, Springer Spaniel, black Lab cross.#Other
And he was a real, a real lovable type,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, definitely not an apartment type animal#Other
so he, uh, he had to stay home.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, what a shame.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
it really was.#Statement-non-opinion
He, uh, apparently had a tough time with it for a little while#Statement-non-opinion
and then he, he got, he came to accept the fact that Mom and Dad were his company from then on,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
oh well.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well Randy, we've just about used up our time here,#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Agree/Accept
and I must say it was interesting.#Statement-opinion
Most definitely.#Agree/Accept
I enjoyed talking about pets with you.#Statement-opinion
Well that's great.#Appreciation
Maybe we'll get together again in the future.#Conventional-closing
That sounds real good.#Conventional-closing
Take care now.#Conventional-closing
You too.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing

Now then I think that#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
are you there?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I'm here.#Statement-non-opinion
All right.#Response Acknowledgement
Do you have any one that has been in a nursing home?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, well, only my, um, my grandmother, but for a very short time.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, she, uh, she was just more or less in a, in a nursing home for, uh, recovery from a broken hip#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because she could receive more medical attention.#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um, that,#Uninterpretable
physical therapy was there and whatever,#Statement-non-opinion
but I think, in visiting her there, um, it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in, uh, weren't there mentally.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, she was probably the only person in the, um, whole nursing home that, uh, still had all of her mental facilities about her.#Statement-non-opinion
So that was, uh, that was very disheartening.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, what do you think can be done about that?#Wh-Question
I mean, what can we do,#Wh-Question
Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's really hard, I guess.#Statement-opinion
I, I come from a family of, um, of, uh, take care of your elders, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, my, my dad's mother is an invalid,#Statement-non-opinion
and she lives with my aunt and uncle,#Statement-non-opinion
and they care for her, you know, all around the clock.#Statement-non-opinion
Though she's not, uh, she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention, she, because of arthritis, she's just unable to get out of bed.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I guess, you know, there's that family commitment.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I know that my parents, my mother is trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can. Um,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I can remembe-,#Uninterpretable
of course I'm#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
old enough to remember when the family or the church took care of all of this.#Other
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We did not have to call on, on someone else,#Statement-non-opinion
and I feel,#Statement-non-opinion
no, you tell me how you feel about,#Action-directive
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well probably, I think, as long as the person's able to, um, to understand what's going on around them#Statement-opinion
and I think, you know, my grandmother right now is still able to walk around,#Statement-non-opinion
and she's still able to, uh, to do some things for herself, though she gets Meals On Wheels#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
which I think is a great thing, because, um, it saves people from having to prepare food for her, because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on, or whatever, although she does most things very well, it still makes a little bit easier for her.#Other
Certainly d-,#Agree/Accept
Uh.#Uninterpretable
I worked with an agency in West Texas that they, it's where they really started this concept of Meals On Wheels#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If they didn't have to, you know, go into a kitchen#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
my mother expired just, just a little over a year ago,#Statement-non-opinion
and we had finally,#Statement-non-opinion
she didn't want to live with either my sister or me#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but we, we got, found a retirement center for her,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was beautiful#Statement-non-opinion
and they had all these, they didn't even have nursing care there.#Statement-non-opinion
So until,#Uninterpretable
as long as mother was, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
mobile and#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
got her food,#Other
and she was with people with whom she enjoyed.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that,#Uninterpretable
I think, you know, it's really funny,#Statement-opinion
I have two grandmothers still alive,#Statement-non-opinion
and my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible.#Statement-non-opinion
She's like openly told people.#Statement-non-opinion
She's always been very good about knowing,#Statement-non-opinion
yes, she's eighty-nine,#Statement-non-opinion
and she said that she would really like to stay in her house as long as possible, because it's her home.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But when the time comes, um, she, and she can't do things#Statement-non-opinion
and she has to be cared for, whatever, she would prefer, and she's actually said this, to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment, uh, probably with like a living space and a bedroom#Statement-non-opinion
Yes, sir.#Appreciation
with maybe a kitchenette, so that if she, you know, if she wants to fix herself something light, she can do that,#Other
but if she wants to go to a meal, she can go down the hallway, uh, to a room where there's a cafeteria#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and there's other people there,#Statement-non-opinion
and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company.#Statement-non-opinion
Being a widow#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I find that eating alone is one of the hardest things#Other
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have to do.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have just recently retired,#Statement-non-opinion
and I am finding it extremely hard to adjust to.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, mother had the little kitchenette#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and she could do all these fine things that she just, ha-, had a microwave, had to pop#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
her popcorn.#Other
Now this is wonderful.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But when it came time for a full meal, then mother was able to go with people#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and enjoy.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think, I think that probably, until, until they're really invalids, uh, the elderly are invalids, I think that they should be able to interact with other people#Statement-opinion
Oh, I think so.#Agree/Accept
in an environment that they choose, if they can, if the family can afford it.#Other
Well.#Uninterpretable
I mean, um, see, I know that my grandmother would like to stay in her house,#Statement-non-opinion
and my parents actually said, you know, that they may have to take their end, sometime, so, because, you know, my grandma, she says who she wants to live with,#Statement-non-opinion
she's pretty, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
she lets people know,#Statement-non-opinion

Okay.#Other
My children are all grown up.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, now see, I've got two children#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, they're,#Uninterpretable
one is o-, uh, just turned to be a teenager#Statement-non-opinion
and the other one is on his way,#Statement-non-opinion
so.#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, uh, I'm a single parent,#Statement-non-opinion
so I think it makes it more difficult for me to, uh, you know, find time with my, my children since I#Statement-non-opinion
I'll bet.#Appreciation
work#Other
and then, of course, take care of the house a-, and all this good kind of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, so it's a real, uh, it's a real problem for me.#Statement-non-opinion
I'll bet it is.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What is the favorite thing you do with your children?#Wh-Question
Uh, the, the thing that we like to do the most is to watch T V together.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the kids like to play Nintendo,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm no good at it,#Statement-non-opinion
so I don't like to play.#Statement-non-opinion
You just watch them play, huh?#Yes-No-Question
That's right,#Affirmative non-yes answers
that's right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
I, I tried it once or twice,#Statement-non-opinion
but I didn't feel like I was very good at it either.#Statement-non-opinion
Me either.#Agree/Accept
My grandson got me to one day,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they talk about these different levels and stuff#Statement-non-opinion
and I've never got off of level one#Statement-non-opinion
Different worlds#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Yes answers
and how do you get to another world, you know?#Rhetorical-Questions
And I, I don't even know what they're talking about.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I know,#Agree/Accept
I agree with you,#Agree/Accept
so, uh,#Other
.#Non-verbal
But, no,#Other
the other thing I think we like to go to the movies, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you?#Yes-No-Question
That's,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
that's a, that's a neat thing.#Statement-non-opinion
So I guess we're all in, uh, you know, movie, uh, fanatics or whatever around here.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So we like to do those kind of things.#Statement-non-opinion
I know when our kids were growing up, our, we were big into water sports.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We had a boat#Statement-non-opinion
and they all skied#Statement-non-opinion
and in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing#Statement-non-opinion
and they always took other friends with them#Statement-non-opinion
and we had a lot of fun doing that,#Statement-non-opinion
but#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, how neat.#Appreciation
I had all girls#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so we didn't do too much sports wise.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
little boys do all of those things#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but,#Uninterpretable
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
see, I have a son#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, you know, it's football in the fall and, and baseball in the spring#Statement-non-opinion
and, and#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's one activity after another.#Other
I, I'm constantly going back and forth.#Statement-non-opinion
I'll bet you really are.#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And my daughter has, uh, tennis,#Statement-non-opinion
so it's between tennis and, and bowling.#Statement-non-opinion
My,#Uninterpretable

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in, in the family,#Other
so,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It, it's really neat.#Other
Well, when mine were real little, they all played soccer#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Other
.#Non-verbal
you know, that was just for a couple of years#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when they were pretty small for girls#Other
and then they got more interested in other things,#Statement-non-opinion
Boys#Collaborative Completion
I'm not sure that they would admit it at that age, that it was boys,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
but I think that's probably what it was.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I know that, uh, my daughter, uh, even though she goes out with the, the sports and everything, uh, yeah she likes to watch the football for, uh, the kids#Statement-non-opinion
I'm sorry.#Apology
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, that was a cat that hit the telephone.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Get away, cat,#3rd-party-talk
gosh#3rd-party-talk
I guess it's why they wanted to do it on this type of telephone because there's all kind of activity that goes on.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
But, uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
my, uh, my kids are, they're starting to grow up, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
It's not going to be too many more years before I, uh, uh, you know, they'll be gone#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, uh, there won't be as many activities.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you, uh,#Yes-No-Question
But they,#Uninterpretable
but you enjoy them,#Statement-non-opinion
I think, the older mine get, the more I enjoy them.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I, I agree with you.#Agree/Accept
I, I do.#Agree/Accept
I'm so glad they're out of the, that young, real young#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
age#Other

And, I mean, I didn't,#Uninterpretable
it wasn't that I didn't like them#Statement-non-opinion

when they were little,#Other
but the older they got, I enjoyed them as teenagers.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And now that they're each,#Statement-non-opinion
of course three girls, they're each becoming the, they've all become women in themselves that it's been neat to watch them.#Statement-non-opinion

Oh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And bring the kids#Other

Where d-, oh,#Uninterpretable

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and we spend weekends at the, in the country with them#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
quite a bit,#Other
but#Statement-non-opinion
Uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
as far as doing any activity, now that the grand kids are here, we all just stay around the house mostly.#Other
Oh, yeah#Other
That's true.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's too much effort to go somewhere with all the kids.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yes,#Agree/Accept
oh, yes.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
Boy, I know, especially when they grow up like that,#Statement-non-opinion
so I'm trying to, these last five or six years, I'm trying to make them really special and#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, very precious since that's, uh, about the only time we've got left.#Other
They'll always remember it, too.#Statement-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
yes,#Agree/Accept
absolutely.#Agree/Accept
I, I think so, too.#Statement-opinion
I hear mine saying, well, I remember mother and daddy used to take us to do so and so.#Statement-non-opinion
I need to take my boys to do this or that, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I remember the year we went to Disneyworld, as quick as my kids are big enough, we're going to go to Disneyworld#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
You know#Other
There we go.#Statement-non-opinion
I know, I know they can't wait#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they just really can't wait to be able to take their kids where they had fun.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
But,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so well, I still got a few more years,#Statement-non-opinion
so I'm, uh, I'm hanging onto those and doing as much activity as I can with them.#Statement-non-opinion
Do you work?#Yes-No-Question
Yes,#Yes answers
uh-huh,#Yes answers
I sure do.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I work full time,#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh, it, it,#Uninterpretable
that cuts into our free time right there.#Statement-opinion
It really does.#Agree/Accept
The time you have with them has to be quality time then.#Statement-opinion
That's right,#Agree/Accept
that's right#Agree/Accept
and, uh, vacations are very special for us, and activities.#Statement-non-opinion
I imagine that they have, uh, some, a lot of homework, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, this being a school night and stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh, it's, it's in the same old y-, you know, routine of, uh, you know, doing homework and, you know, trying to talk between all of that and, and, uh, the other activities that we all have.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, there's just so many things to do with them nowadays, though,#Statement-opinion
and especially if they're active kids.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Like you say you bowl.#Declarative Yes-No-Question

Not very good#Other
it's not been a good day#Statement-non-opinion
I went,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon.#Other
I don't know.#Hedge
I finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn#Statement-non-opinion
so I hope she's turned it in.#Statement-non-opinion
Are you eating?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, I ju-,#Uninterpretable
go ahead,#Action-directive
I'll stop eating.#Statement-non-opinion
I just barely got#Statement-non-opinion
No it's,#Uninterpretable
home from the university.#Other
Say what?#Signal-non-understanding
I just barely got home from the university.#Statement-non-opinion
Tell you what we can do is, uh, I can punch the, uh, one,#Offers, Options Commits
.#Non-verbal
and then w-, after five minutes when the, uh, uh, voice comes on, we can talk all night if we want#Offers, Options Commits
Okay,#Agree/Accept
go ahead,#Action-directive
fire away.#Action-directive
Uh, I love the irony of, uh, talking about this subject on April the,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
fifteenth#Other
But, uh, I'm afraid I'm, I'm probably in the minority.#Statement-opinion
I, I actually don't think that we, uh, pay too much in this country. Uh#Statement-opinion
I agree with you#Agree/Accept
uh, particularly, uh, in this part of the country w-,#Other
uh, I guess I do have a, a bone to pick with, uh, uh, the way taxes are distributed#Statement-opinion
Uh, I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
and the sales tax can't.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that's regressive#Statement-opinion
and, uh, uh, it's kind of dumb.#Statement-opinion
I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax.#Statement-non-opinion
But, on the other hand, I don't mind that it's only on, you know, things that aren't like groceries and that,#Statement-non-opinion
it's not on that.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I mean, nobody taxes groceries.#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Reject
they do.#Statement-non-opinion
Where?#Wh-Question
In Arizona.#Statement-non-opinion
Is that right?#Yes-No-Question
Uh-huh.#Yes answers
.#Non-verbal
But we have a pretty low income ta-, I mean pretty low tax rate here.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I think the, the sales tax, they just got to do something about it.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes.#Statement-opinion
Right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I guess when I hear, when I see the comparison between the United States and, uh, any other western country, uh, their, their rates are like, uh, forty-one, forty-two and ours are like thirty-six, thirty-seven, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
if you compute as a percentage of total income, all taxes lumped together, we actually do pretty well.#Statement-opinion
T-, th-, there's no other country that's, that is taxed as low as we are.#Statement-non-opinion
Well and I still think that, having lived in Europe for awhile, you know, difference in living conditions#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
are certainly well worth, uh, what we pay for it.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm, I'm not sure I understand what you mean.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I mean, I think,#Statement-opinion
I was in Germany, you know, for several years#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have, then have to live there.#Statement-opinion
Oh, you mean, lowest end of living in spite of lower, higher taxes.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah.#Uninterpretable
Higher taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
I suppose that's true,#Statement-opinion
yeah.#Agree/Accept
Uh, probably m-, less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Still's that way to some extent.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think the other problem is, you know, it, it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you, theoretically, can do something about.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I look, for example,#Uninterpretable
and you're not quite in the same situation#Statement-non-opinion
but like school taxes for me#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
biggest bargain in the world.#Other
I wish I didn't have to pay any more fo-, to my physicians in a year#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than I had to pay for all of my school taxes.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
since, uh, I send my kids to parochial school, that .#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that, that's probably a little tougher on you#Statement-opinion
It's not, it's not quite the bargain that .#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
But, I mean, I pay them gladly.#Statement-non-opinion
That's a decision,#Statement-non-opinion
I think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a, uh, two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools f-, with the same tax money.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, I mean, that's, that's the way Americans want to interpret it,#Statement-opinion
I guess that's all right#Statement-opinion
But,#Uninterpretable
yeah.#Uninterpretable
I,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
and if I were, uh,#Uninterpretable
when I was single and again when I'm retired,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I will not mind paying, uh, what it takes to keep the schools good.#Other
That's always been a high priority#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Reject
I think that's just you though.#Statement-opinion
I do,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
I think in places,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I think in places like California, people are beginning to find that in, in areas that are fairly well off, if you add the, uh, uh, people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are, uh, just looking for fun, th- people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done.#Other
That seems a, a, like a cultural lapse.#Statement-opinion
I mean, people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools.#Statement-opinion
They,#Uninterpretable
Of course, I think with the graying of America, we're going to see that problem in lots of places.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
People would rather, uh, increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them.#Statement-opinion
But I think it's sad#Statement-opinion
Or build roads.#Collaborative Completion
selfish and shortsighted.#Other
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
Well,#Uninterpretable

Okay,#Other
Dee, are you familiar with the Latin American policies?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
to a point,#Statement-opinion
it's not my best subject.#Statement-opinion
Really,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah#Agree/Accept
it's not mine either,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I know, I know our policy,#Statement-opinion
like in Nicaragua, I am familiar with that because we have, uh, some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border#Statement-non-opinion
and they are missionaries there#Statement-non-opinion
and they, they live there#Statement-non-opinion
and they have to travel by boat forty-five minutes to get to their car and stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
and uh, I know that they helped a lot of those Sandanistas refugees coming across the border#Statement-non-opinion
and they housed them and stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
They have been down there about three years now,#Statement-non-opinion
and they wrote that it's kind of weird#Statement-non-opinion
they have bats in their roof,#Statement-non-opinion
but the bats eat the bad spiders#Statement-non-opinion
so they leave the bats, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
So.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's a whole, whole different culture#Statement-opinion
or,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It, it's weird down there because there's always lizards and things running around that people live there,#Other
they just, they take it for granted#Statement-non-opinion
and it's like we go down there on vacation,#Statement-non-opinion
it's like oh, how can these people live with these lizards and like bats in their house?#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think their policy with them that though, is, uh,#Statement-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
I think,#Statement-opinion
I wish we would have just,#Statement-opinion
I'm not that up on the policy of ways.#Statement-opinion
I know that's kind of old,#Statement-opinion
but I don't know,#Hedge
I just, I'm glad that the Sandanistas aren't in power anymore because I think that they were very wicked. And, uh, probably some of the biggest drug dealers that the world has probably ever seen,#Statement-opinion
and I feel like most of the leaders in Latin America are probably,#Statement-opinion
you would be safe to say that they were just very very, you know, big into drugs.#Statement-opinion
Very very corrupt, like the Panamanians are, were very corrupt.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The thing about it though is the Panamanians is, a lot of servicemen down there.#Statement-non-opinion
A lot of, a lot of American servicemen are involved,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because I guess there was a big, big, uh, scam that, that all these guys up.#Statement-non-opinion
Thousands of servicemen,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
got caught for running a drug ring.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, it's, it's like everybody is into it,#Statement-opinion
it's just greed.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Human greed.#Other
Interestingly in Honduras,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's very pro-American.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And we have I,#Uninterpretable
my girlfriend used to, uh, be in the Navy#Statement-non-opinion
and she was based, uh, based in Panama.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In Honduras, very, uh, uh, pro-American.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And there's a lot of men, I don't know how many American, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
soldiers are there,#Statement-non-opinion
but there's a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, they, uh,#Uninterpretable
and you can't, the American government you can't trust them either, because you think, you don't know how corrupt they are. I mean they keep people in power like the Shah of Iran and,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
things like that,#Other
I mean, it's the lesser of two evils,#Statement-opinion
they will probably say this is the lesser of two evils.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I don't know how corrupt the Honduran government is.#Statement-opinion
But the,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they need to have more checks and balances in their government to get rid of the corruption. But I think first though,#Statement-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
they need to, I think they need the repentance on the leadership of the different nations for all their, uh, you know the atrocities that they commit and the drug dealings, and in the, just in the drug crimes,#Statement-opinion
because I feel like a lot of the leadership in those nations are so engrossed in the drug crimes that until they repent or they are moved from power, that you know,#Statement-opinion
because there are so many of them that the next one to come up, if you just knock one off and then have another one,#Statement-opinion
and I know a lot of those nations, there's, uh, Brazil, I know, is like forty percent evangelical Christian. Not just go to church but, you know, really on fire for God,#Statement-opinion
and they are just surpassing America, Latin America by the drugs.#Statement-opinion
You know, it's just incomprehensible,#Statement-opinion
and, uh, so I just think that, I think that God is going to honor that and that he is going to put in some good leadership,#Statement-opinion
and I know, the president of, I believe Costa Rica is a Christian.#Statement-opinion
And he goes to, no Guatemala, because he goes to virgo church in Guatemala City.#Statement-opinion
The church is in real close relationship with him.#Statement-opinion
And he is a former president of Guatemala.#Statement-non-opinion
He's an elder at virgo church#Statement-non-opinion
and, you know that, that God is doing something#Statement-opinion
and he is raising up some leaders#Statement-opinion
and the people want him back as president bad,#Statement-non-opinion
but they have a rule in Guatemala that he can't have another term#Statement-non-opinion
and so the, the people are trying to override that, I mean not just the Christians, but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority, the people rejoice.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
good.#Appreciation
See, that's the thing,#Statement-opinion
that it's going, have to,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's the undoing of everything,#Statement-opinion
and it's the,#Uninterpretable
we have no morals, when we, talk about the crime and all that in the city,#Statement-opinion
it's just the kids have no morals.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's the thing that will eventually, you know,#Statement-opinion
if anyone is going to be saved.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It is having a good moral background.#Statement-opinion
And it's funny you mention Costa Rica, because they are just, they are one of the most successful and peaceful countries,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in Central America.#Other
So, I was reading an article in the, uh, National Geographic#Statement-non-opinion
and, I don't know,#Hedge
I don't think they have any more money than any of the other countries,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they don't have oil or anything,#Statement-non-opinion
and they don't have big tourism.#Statement-non-opinion
So maybe it is their faith that enables them to keep the crime out.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know that Costa Rica, they don't allow anybody to come that, uh, to come any, uh, what do you call, what do you call immigrants?#Statement-non-opinion
They don't allow anything like that#Statement-non-opinion
like I could not go to Costa Rica and live as an American citizen.#Statement-non-opinion
They would not permit me to live there to work.#Statement-non-opinion
They wouldn't.#Statement-non-opinion
Their jobs are there for Costa Ricans.#Statement-non-opinion
They don't allow people to move in, like less nations, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
They don't, they don't probably take a lot of refugees from other countries either.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
take the job.#Statement-non-opinion
No#No answers
they don't take any.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean I couldn't even go there.#Statement-non-opinion
My husband had to receive all this special permission to go,#Statement-non-opinion
so even with, uh, you know, in, uh, inner company, you know, transfer, or something,#Statement-non-opinion
and I have another friend in, uh, Costa Rica that,#Statement-non-opinion
she was born there.#Statement-non-opinion
She's Costa Rican.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess I do know a little bit.#Statement-opinion
I went to Mexico City one time and stayed.#Statement-non-opinion
I have been there twice and stayed#Statement-non-opinion
and, that, aw, that was just really sad.#Statement-opinion
But, a lot of it though is their debt.#Statement-non-opinion
I think that we should not loan them anymore money,#Statement-opinion
that if we still want to give them money, give them money, quit loaning it to them.#Statement-opinion
You're not going to get it back.#Statement-opinion
Don't be indebted to anybody.#Statement-opinion
Don't be the loaner or borrower.#Statement-opinion
It's just not good.#Statement-opinion
We need to, if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them,#Statement-opinion
but quit loaning all the money out.#Statement-opinion
Which I don't think we are loaning anymore now,#Statement-opinion
but that's how we got into a problem.#Statement-opinion
If we got, the,#Uninterpretable
we have, we went in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars.#Statement-opinion
That's common sense,#Statement-opinion
you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back.#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
also, uh, uh, Mexico, uh, we will loan the money in uh,#Statement-non-opinion
a lot of the higher, the higher people,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
were just stealing it and,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
building these beautiful homes,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and nice ranches and things.#Other
.#Non-verbal
So we are, we're suckers.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we, we are, it's like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money,#Statement-opinion
that was really stupid on our part to even loan it to them.#Statement-opinion
You don't loan money to people like that.#Statement-opinion
I mean if you feel like you need to give them something to help them out, fine,#Statement-opinion
but you don't go making billions of dollars of loans in, to people that you can just look at the situation,#Statement-opinion
They know they're not going to pay it back.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and know that they are going to be capable of paying us back,#Statement-opinion
and that puts a bondage on them.#Statement-opinion
It makes, you know, pressure on the nation, and on the people, and on the leadership, and makes their inflation go up,#Statement-opinion
and it's just a big mess.#Statement-opinion
Did you go to Mexico City, uh, anywhere near when the earthquake hit.#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
but I knew people,#Statement-non-opinion
I was there before that,#Statement-non-opinion
but I knew people,#Statement-non-opinion
I got a letter from a friend of mine that I had met there, that who, who the apartment building was destroyed#Statement-non-opinion
and they were living in a tent,#Statement-non-opinion
so it's kind of weird, you know.#Statement-opinion
To these people who were on U S dive, the Mexican diving, we went to the pool together, and watched them dive and all this,#Statement-non-opinion
so they were you know, just normal people, weren't squatters or poor people or anything that, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I did, I knew all of my friends there,#Statement-non-opinion
but none of them that I know of, got killed in it.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, they're all Christians though.#Statement-non-opinion
God really protected them.#Statement-opinion
See that broke out a revival in Mexico City. That C B S news and A B C never told you about.#Statement-opinion
There's been a real revival in Mexico City since that earthquake, because there's a lot of, you know there's a lot of sin in those nations and a lot, lots of witchcraft, a lot of witchcraft. A whole lot of witchcraft.#Statement-opinion
Oh, I can imagine.#Appreciation
So, a lot of it in the name of Christianity.#Other
Oh, really.#Backchannel in question form
Oh, yeah.#Yes answers
There's a lot, you know#Statement-non-opinion
they call themselves Christians,#Statement-non-opinion
but you know they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff, and just a whole lot of the generational things too, like the Mayans and the Incas.#Statement-opinion
You can't find a trace of them because God totally destroyed them for how wicked they were.#Statement-opinion
And yet, they are revered and honored and almost worshiped by#Statement-opinion
so many people,#Statement-opinion
even now in America, you know, we wouldn't know the truth with all of Indian groups that were totally removed from the face of the earth, because of how wicked they were.#Statement-opinion
I've been down to the pyramids#Statement-non-opinion
and I have climbed to the top of the pyramid where they used to take a beating heart out of a young thirteen year old boy,#Statement-non-opinion
and they hold it up to the sun God,#Statement-non-opinion
and that's pretty of heavy duty.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is, is there still blood stains on the altar#Yes-No-Question
or has it worn away through the years?#Or-Clause
I don't think so.#Negative non-no answers
The little box is black on the top of the pyramid in the sun.#Statement-non-opinion
It's black,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Uninterpretable
you can't really tell,#Statement-opinion
but it was kind of weird, you know,#Statement-opinion
you think, wow there is where they did sacrifices to false Gods.#Statement-opinion
Do you get spooked, you feel,#Yes-No-Question
or do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there?#Or-Clause
Because,#Uninterpretable
Uh, at that time, I kind of did.#Affirmative non-yes answers
It really impressed me, just you know, feeling#Statement-opinion
but I wasn't a Christian when I went there,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I think that a lot of those, those you know, generational things#Statement-opinion
I think, that God sees I'm praying, you know,#Statement-opinion
that keeps the Christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray, because that does affect that things, you know, in your background.#Statement-opinion

What are your favorite T V shows?#Wh-Question

Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
I-, i-, i-,#Uninterpretable
it's a good show.#Statement-opinion

and you need to sometimes break them to get your point across and for a good reason * Shouldn't this be a separately labelled slash unit, not a continuation of B.26?#Other

And he seems to do that sometimes#Statement-opinion
H-,#Uninterpretable
he's tender hearted fellow.#Statement-opinion

I think that's what first drew us to him, the, uh, the, the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours.#Statement-non-opinion

We went years ago.#Statement-non-opinion
We haven't been lately#Statement-non-opinion
and I know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything,#Statement-non-opinion
but we used to have a lot of fun there.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you know, we went there once.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, we had been in Dallas#Statement-non-opinion
and we were on our way home#Statement-non-opinion
and we were driving#Statement-non-opinion
and we said let's go to New Orleans.#Statement-non-opinion
So when he said, well, this year, you know, I have a week there on a, a project#Statement-non-opinion
he's going to be,#Statement-non-opinion
and then I said, well, I'll going along,#Statement-non-opinion
I hope it's swimming season#Quotation
because it wasn't a tremendous thing, amount of things to do.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That I wanted to do there.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if you don't like the night life and the antique shopping, there isn't much there,#Statement-opinion
but, that can be fun.#Statement-opinion
It, well, and that's probably,#Statement-non-opinion
we do like the night life, to an extent#Statement-non-opinion
and they do have a Mardi Gras night planned.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I'm kind of anxious for that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, yours to Disneyworld sounds a little bit better.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Did you know that next week there's several T V shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary.#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I know this is a real good time to go, because they are having so many activities and special shows.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, and with a daughter, nine, it is just,#Statement-non-opinion
she's old enough to really grasp#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the meaning behind,#Other
Be excited about all of it.#Summarize/reformulate
Uh, so, well, if you're working, then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go.#Statement-opinion
Well, not really,#Reject
we're doing the same thing. Tying it in with my husband's business trip#Statement-non-opinion
and I just save vacation for things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's,#Uninterpretable
And, uh, just travel whenever we can.#Other
Well, I really, I think travel#Statement-opinion
when I heard my topic today, I thought, okay#Statement-non-opinion
How easy#Collaborative Completion
that's my fav-, that's my favorite#Other
becau-,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And really at our point of life our children are grown#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, it has just worked out really well with this, uh, position he's in.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because I can go at a spur of the moment or what have you#Other
and it depends where he's going whether or not I decide to go along#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I do, do like to travel#Statement-non-opinion
and it's, uh,#Uninterpretable
I don't mind the pool life at all#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
during the day.#Other
And I like to sight see#Statement-non-opinion
and I love to shop.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it's#Uninterpretable
So that's perfect.#Summarize/reformulate
What more could you ask for?#Rhetorical-Questions
That's right,#Agree/Accept
but it,#Uninterpretable
And then got to pick and choose the places.#Summarize/reformulate
Well, and one of my very favorite is Las Vegas.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, that#Uninterpretable
I would have to say we both end up going to Las Vegas, uh, probably once every maybe year and a half.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so I've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets#Statement-non-opinion
because we have a lot of flying with Continental#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of Continental.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
it's kind of shaky.#Statement-non-opinion
And I said now that we have all the miles,#Statement-non-opinion
we better start using them.#Quotation
That's true.#Agree/Accept
Uh,#Uninterpretable
It really is.#Agree/Accept
So we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, when we normally go that way, we like to go to California at the same time, because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
from Texas.#Other
Our last big trip, we drove through New Mexico and Colorado and went to the Grand Canyon and, and, uh, back through Silverton and Durango#Statement-non-opinion
and, oh, it was fun.#Statement-non-opinion
It was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country#Statement-non-opinion
and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it.#Statement-non-opinion
Our,#Uninterpretable
I think that's a good trip.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And really, for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now we did, what we sometimes do since we are in Ohio#Statement-non-opinion
and it takes a while just to even get to the, what I would call the more picturesque part of the country,#Statement-non-opinion
we will fly to something like,#Statement-non-opinion
once we flew to Colorado to Denver#Statement-non-opinion
and then we rented a car for two weeks#Statement-non-opinion
and we went through the northern route and through Utah#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and as far west as Las Vegas#Other
and then we returned through, uh, New Mexico that you just mentioned.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, there's#Statement-opinion
oh, it was just great.#Other
too much to see really.#Other
Oh, I, I think that's, that's the way to,#Statement-opinion

.#Non-verbal
Okay.#Other
Uh, so your, you, I guess you're probably in the same, uh, same situation uh, we're in.#Statement-opinion
We're kind of past having to provide child care.#Statement-non-opinion
Our, our kids are grown up.#Statement-non-opinion
We don't have any grandchildren yet.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, uh, they're,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How old are your children?#Wh-Question
Uh, one's twenty-six#Statement-non-opinion
and the other is, uh, twenty, twenty-one.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So they're, uh, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they're going to be getting there.#Collaborative Completion
They're, they're getting there.#Other
You know, there's no#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
no, no prospects right away for anything to happen.#Other
U-, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
I have, uh, five children.#Statement-non-opinion
I have a eighteen year old son.#Statement-non-opinion
The rest of my girls are like twenty-three, twenty-six, twenty-eight, and twenty-nine.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I have three granddaughters right now.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I, uh,#Uninterpretable
one's in Iowa.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, she's, she's a teacher#Statement-non-opinion
and what she does is she,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
teaches at a preschool.#Other
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and so she kind of,#Uninterpretable
and they let her bring her, her little daughter in for free.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then, so#Uninterpretable
but she just works part-time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Then I have another daughter in, uh, Bountiful, Utah#Statement-non-opinion
and she has to work full-time#Statement-non-opinion
and it's just tearing her apart.#Statement-non-opinion
She has a private baby-sitter.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, the baby just screams.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, the baby is like seventeen months#Statement-non-opinion
and she just screams.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there.#Statement-non-opinion
They're not even there yet#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's hard.#Statement-opinion
We,#Uninterpretable
And, and then I have my, uh, uh, I have a seven month old granddaughter#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, her mother stays home#Statement-non-opinion
and she, they live, they live with us. You know, in, as Orange County#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is really expensive.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They live with us#Statement-non-opinion
and so, of course, we love it. Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, uh, she just,#Uninterpretable
uh, she used to work in pre, in the preschool and, and, and child care#Statement-non-opinion
and she says after working in there#Statement-non-opinion
and, and, you know, here she was a provider#Statement-non-opinion
but, you know, there's only so much one person can do.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
She said it's so awful.#Statement-non-opinion
She said she'll never put her child in a, in a, in a preca-, in a p-, in a preschool.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere.#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it's really, it's really, really very difficult#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
What did you do when your kids were growing up?#Wh-Question
Were you,#Uninterpretable
Well, when, when#Uninterpretable
the, uh, the first, uh, ten years, see first ten or twelve years, I stayed home.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, then after that I, I went to work.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, uh, uh, a couple of times I just, uh, uh, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
th-, then I had one job#Statement-non-opinion
and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job.#Statement-non-opinion
And then, and then like about, later I, I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter.#Statement-non-opinion
Supposed to be good, uh, recommended person from the church#Statement-non-opinion
and I knew her personally.#Statement-non-opinion
She had two kids of her own and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, first of all, uh, her children were sick all the time.#Statement-non-opinion
So when my son stayed over there, he got sick.#Statement-non-opinion
He got sick,#Repeat-phrase
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Same thing, same thing that the, her kids had,#Statement-non-opinion
right?#Tag-Question
Right.#Repeat-phrase
Well,#Uninterpretable
And so, uh, we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock.#Statement-non-opinion
Then he, she'd take my son and her daughter over t-, to kindergarten.#Statement-non-opinion
But s-,#Uninterpretable
that day, uh, I was saying now he, he's sick.#Statement-non-opinion
And she goes well, she goes, he has the same thing that all my kids have.#Statement-non-opinion
That's what he got, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Goes, well, okay,#Statement-non-opinion
so it's not like he's going to infect her kids.#Statement-non-opinion
But then what happened was, is, I said, uh, he just threw up#Statement-non-opinion
and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty#Statement-non-opinion
so she said well she'll keep him home#Statement-non-opinion
and he'll probably just sleep anyway.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
Well, you know, what#Rhetorical-Questions
that woman sent her, sent him to kindergarten.#Statement-non-opinion
She sent him to kindergarten.#Statement-non-opinion
As soon as he went there, the teacher took one look at him#Statement-non-opinion
and he threw up again#Statement-non-opinion
and they put him in the nursery, uh, they put him in the nurse's office.#Statement-non-opinion
Guess so,#Appreciation
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And then what happened was, is, you know, they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter.#Statement-non-opinion
Called her#Statement-non-opinion
and they said, uh, that he's sick.#Statement-non-opinion
Well she wasn't home.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Uninterpretable
I mean her, all her kids were sick#Statement-non-opinion
but she wasn't home, right.#Statement-non-opinion
And her, and her, her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick.#Statement-non-opinion
Now why didn't he, why didn't she keep him home with her?#Rhetorical-Questions
No,#No answers
she didn't do that.#Statement-non-opinion
So, it got to the point where he's, he's supposed to get out of, uh, kindergarten like about two thirty.#Statement-non-opinion
And I had to leave work.#Statement-non-opinion
It was, it was five o'clock in the evening#Statement-non-opinion
and I found out he was still there at school.#Statement-non-opinion
And they were calling me#Statement-non-opinion
and they said somebody's got to pick him up.#Statement-non-opinion
And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up, she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school.#Statement-non-opinion
I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
And he had a hundred and four fever.#Statement-non-opinion
They couldn't, uh, give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was so furious.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I quit that job#Statement-non-opinion
and I stayed home for awhile longer.#Statement-non-opinion
Then I went and got a, uh, a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
a little more flexibility.#Summarize/reformulate
You can come and go.#Summarize/reformulate
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but, uh, I haven't had any good, really very good experience with child care#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
When, when our kids were small we had a couple of, uh, good, good women who, uh, would often c-, uh, get them to come to the house.#Statement-non-opinion

Okay.#Other
Well, ho-, how do you feel about, uh, drug testing?#Open-Question
Um, personally, I don't have a problem with it, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I think, uh, as far as, uh, protecting fellow employees, protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do, um, it's justified.#Statement-opinion
On the other hand, um, I do agree that it's, it's a, it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, I would never, I would never have a problem with anyone testing me,#Statement-non-opinion
but I can understand why people would object.#Statement-non-opinion
So, I guess, uh, I guess, uh, I'm kind of mixed on it,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
still at this point.#Other
I am too a little bit,#Agree/Accept
I mean, I, I don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and, you know, obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth,#Statement-opinion
but I don't really like having to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
It,#Uninterpretable
That's right.#Agree/Accept
And I don't like the idea of it, it's, it's, makes too much of a big brother type of thing.#Statement-opinion
That's absolutely right.#Agree/Accept
It, it, uh, I guess it all comes down to, uh, you know, a, a definition of, uh, how much out, outside activities affect your work#Statement-opinion
and, uh, uh, granted, you know, that,#Uninterpretable
any, any kind of drug use on, on company property and whatnot,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is, is definitely not acceptable.#Other
Uh, uh, I don't think anybody would ever argue that.#Statement-opinion
Huh-uh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Or, uh, any, any after affects carrying over into the workday#Other
but, um, you know, I don't, I'm not particularly concerned with what people do, um, after they leave for the day especially if I don't, if I don't, uh, see any results of it the next day.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think so too.#Statement-opinion
But, you know, it's one of those things.#Hedge
Well, it, it is, it, you know,#Uninterpretable
on the other hand you, you've got, uh, you've got the, uh, the possibility of people, oh,#Statement-opinion
you've got some people could be arrested for, uh, drug use, drug dealings and things like that,#Statement-opinion
and, uh, if their, if their employers name hits the papers and that it's, it's,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's a mark against them,#Other
the company and, uh, you know, what kind of people work there, what, uh,#Statement-opinion
Plus, I guess, if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time, then the company has lost what they've put into that employee,#Statement-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
That's right.#Agree/Accept
and their expertise or whatever.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
E-, even if it is, you know, a company policy of, uh, immediate termination or whatever, they still have to replace them.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, there's, there's a lot involved there.#Statement-opinion
Well, do you think that, um, it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing#Yes-No-Question
or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule#Or-Clause
or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it?#Or-Clause
I think, I think the regular schedule stuff, um, that when you say everybody get out of it, that's a good point,#Statement-opinion
I never really thought of it that way.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, you know, if, if they have time enough they can,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if they really can,#Statement-non-opinion
stay off of it.#Other
um, I think the big-, the biggest problem I've got is, is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, as far as the new hires, I, I hired on just early enough that I, I missed it. Um, where the new hires were concerned#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, not, nobody, no,#Uninterpretable
I don't think anybody questions that, um, testing someone as a, as a precondition to being hired#Statement-opinion
but, um, for the conditions that, for our employment to change while you're on the job that's, I, I don't know, that, that's where I think that most people get upset.#Statement-opinion
It's, uh, you know, it, it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically#Statement-opinion
and, uh,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's just, it, it's a really tough question#Other
and it, you know, it,#Uninterpretable
people have, have really quieted down after everything started#Statement-opinion
but I still think there's a lot of, there's a lot of resentment.#Statement-opinion
I think so too, uh,#Agree/Accept
I know the, the group I was in at the time this all came up they, uh, were quite vocal about it, through electronic mail,#Statement-non-opinion
boy, they just really,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know let them have it from one end to the other,#Other
You bet.#Appreciation
vehemently#Other
but, uh, it has quieted down,#Statement-non-opinion
but I don't think they probably feel any differently,#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
that's right.#Agree/Accept
and some, some of them did quit the company.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I know of some people who did, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
it was, it was indirectly related, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
they could always come up with other reasons#Statement-non-opinion
but it, it had a lot to do with it. Just the, the whole attitude,#Statement-non-opinion
because it's really, uh, it's just really,#Uninterpretable
it, it seems so un-,#Statement-opinion
T I, you know, with the, the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have,#Statement-non-opinion
True.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
um, to all of a sudden, uh, search for attitudes and whatnot.#Other
You know, there's not a lot of pressure to, to vote the right way or anything else around T I.#Statement-opinion
Like there, like there is in some companies or at least, you know,#Statement-opinion
from what I've heard,#Hedge
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
yeah#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I wouldn't like anything of that nature, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
No,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I,#Uninterpretable
don't tell me what to do, you know.#Action-directive
Absolutely not, you know,#Agree/Accept
it's, it's, it's, you know,#Uninterpretable
if you hired me I'll be, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with#Statement-non-opinion
so, uh, you know, let's, let's stick with that original trust, I guess.#Action-directive
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, it's, it's still, it, it still remains a tough question#Statement-opinion
and, it's, there's a lot of, you know, the whole, the whole department of defense, uh, reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot.#Statement-non-opinion
There's a lot of different things that, uh, come into play#Statement-opinion
but that was,#Uninterpretable
I think everybody, everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I guess too if I thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem, then that would be one thing.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I think it's too minor and too, you know,#Other
in, in the whole scope of things this isn't going to, to have any real affect on,#Statement-opinion
I really don't think so.#Statement-opinion
what's going on in the street.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I really don't because, some people are going to, are, are going to risk it, um,#Statement-opinion
it may prevent, e-,#Statement-opinion
I, I guess, I guess what I'm trying to get at is, if it, if it, if it does help a few individuals maybe, maybe it's worth it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, you know, it may prevent somebody who was, was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I don't know if, you know, the,#Statement-opinion
it's, it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation#Statement-opinion
I don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much.#Statement-opinion
There, there's still a big question in my mind#Statement-non-opinion
that, the, the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of, of mistakes on the testing,#Statement-opinion
Well, yes.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is something that still bothers me.#Other
It, it's,#Uninterpretable
That,#Uninterpretable
yes.#Agree/Accept
I, I think that could be a big problem, you know,#Statement-opinion
I would just be irate if they said it was positive and I knew it wasn't,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, that just really rubbed me the wrong way.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Absolutely.#Appreciation
And that,#Uninterpretable
I, I don't know if, uh, I don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too. E-, even if you, you know, if you take, uh, a, a drug that was presc-, prescribed for you#Statement-non-opinion
but the, the prescription has run out you still had some left#Statement-non-opinion
and you happen to take an extra penicillin,#Statement-non-opinion
well, penicillin's not on the list#Hedge
but, you know,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Repeat-phrase
I, I think you understand what I'm getting at,#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Yes answers
it, it can still show up#Statement-non-opinion
and it can still flag as a positive#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent,#Other
No.#Agree/Accept
and, uh, those are the kinds of things that still can show up.#Statement-non-opinion
I guess the one that really got me too was that, uh,#Statement-opinion
let's say your spouse is on a particular drug#Action-directive
and you know what that is,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then you end up with the same problem#Statement-non-opinion
and you take their leftover medicine,#Statement-non-opinion
that's not allowed.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
You know, that's, that's totally out.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right.#Agree/Accept
I even had friends when I was going to college who were in, uh, pharmacy school#Statement-non-opinion
and they could legally, um, provide medicine to their family mens-, frie-, family members and friends#Statement-non-opinion
certain medicines were, were legal now#Statement-non-opinion
I, I, I believe, you know, any of the, any of the ones we would, we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, uh, um, there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, that's interesting.#Appreciation
that can happen.#Other
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, I guess we've exhausted that one.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think so#Statement-opinion
enjoyed talking to you.#Conventional-closing
You too.#Conventional-closing
Good-bye.#Conventional-closing
Good-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay?#Yes-No-Question

I like it because there's a little bit of everything in it.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, that kind of a thing.#Other
Uh, as far as like real novels, I haven't gotten into Shakespeare or any of that type of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I wish I had in, in some senses#Statement-non-opinion

How about you?#Open-Question
Um, well, I like, like you said, real life, um,#Statement-non-opinion
I like biographies of people's lives,#Statement-non-opinion

And, um, I like to read books on improve, like family, marriage, you know, things that are written by like Christian authors or, um, doctors about family and, you know, how to improve your home and all that kind of thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, I like to re-,#Uninterpretable

And it,#Uninterpretable
I can't even really remember.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I think it was a romantic novel by Danielle Steel or one of those.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Yes-No-Question
You know yeah,#Yes answers
honestly.#Appreciation
Um, I don't do as much reading, like I say, as I would like to.#Statement-non-opinion

working a lot of hours at work#Statement-non-opinion

Really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers

we have a home#Other
so it's, you know,#Uninterpretable
a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, that type of thing.#Other
I, I set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is like about eleven more books than I would have read last year,#Statement-non-opinion
but so far I've only read like two books#Statement-non-opinion
and so I'm not doing very well#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
But see I do crafts too,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so it's hard,#Statement-non-opinion
I, if I have a minute that's what I, I do.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I find it's real hard,#Statement-non-opinion
I let papers, newspapers stack up and magazines stack up, if I don't really set aside a time to look or read them.#Statement-non-opinion
That's the,#Uninterpretable
and, and that's like myself#Agree/Accept
I've, I've, I miss it, because I really find it a very relaxing hobby too.#Statement-non-opinion

I really do#Statement-non-opinion

it seems like you can get lost in a book, you know,#Statement-opinion

Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's like an escape for me.#Other
I don't know about you.#Hedge
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's,#Uninterpretable
if I'm really interested in what I'm reading, I mean, hours can go by#Statement-non-opinion
and I, I look up at the clock and say, oh, my word, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In fact, I'd rather read sometimes than watch T V.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
oh, I would too.#Agree/Accept
Um, *#Uninterpretable
But I think you get out of the habit, like you say,#Statement-opinion
you have to like kind of set yourself,#Statement-opinion
Kind of train your mind. *#Other
Yep.#Agree/Accept
Have you ever read, uh, or heard of the book THIS PRESENT DARKNESS?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
That was one of the books I read this year,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's really fast paced and intense.#Statement-non-opinion
It was a nonfiction book or is a fiction book#Statement-non-opinion
but it was ar-,#Uninterpretable
it was one of the best I read,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, it was real good,#Statement-non-opinion
and it was, um, it was one of the few books that#Statement-non-opinion
like it, you know,#Uninterpretable
just hurry up and go through without putting down, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
See that's the other problem I have.#Statement-non-opinion
If I start into something and I really enjoy what I'm reading,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
then I have a terrible time getting away from it too.#Other
I'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning, you know, because I'm so engrossed in it#Statement-non-opinion
and then before you know it, it's time to get up and go to work.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, that type of thing.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's why#Uninterpretable
I, I don't know#Hedge
I'm, I'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Even if I'm, uh, doing something like an afghan, if I'm close to the end, sometimes I'll do the same thing.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know what you would call it,#Hedge
maybe I have a problem#Statement-opinion
No,#Reject
I'm sure it's fast or something.#Statement-opinion
It's terrible,#Statement-opinion
I, I really like books that, that you can get into#Statement-non-opinion
and that's that.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know what you mean.#Agree/Accept
I like reading late at night right before I go to bed sometimes#Statement-non-opinion
I just sleep better or something.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah,#Agree/Accept
you do#Agree/Accept
you kind of get relaxed,#Statement-opinion
that's true.#Agree/Accept
But, uh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I have a lot of craft books that I have too and, uh, magazines.#Statement-non-opinion
I like PEOPLE, you know, those things that are about real people.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, I, I like to, uh, read about people who have been a successful,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

what the heck was his name,#Self-talk
I'm trying to think.#Hold before answer/agreement
He's one of the, uh,#Uninterpretable
Paroe, *#Statement-non-opinion
and um, it was more like, oh,#Uninterpretable
it was tapes and things that they had about him, too.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How he started out as just a salesman and now he's, you know, multimillionaire and that type of thing,#Statement-non-opinion
and how you have to, uh, be aggressive and, you know, really want something for yourself and that type of stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
It's like up to you, in other words, whatever happens in your life.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's not up,#Uninterpretable
it's not someone else,#Statement-non-opinion
you have to do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I find that fascinating that people, you know, can do that kind of thing. Just make up their minds that that's it. You know, have this one direction. *#Statement-non-opinion
And then do it.#Summarize/reformulate
Do it.#Agree/Accept
I can't,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not that focused on something.#Statement-non-opinion

Um, and I'm not, uh, uh, a planner which I wish I was.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, kind of off the wall.#Statement-non-opinion
If someone says, do you want to do this tonight, uh, and I got a mountain of things to do, it's okay, you know, we do it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)

That's funny,#Statement-opinion
e-, even though I admire someone who isn't,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like I am, you know, and, and I wish I could be more that way#Other

There may be some schools you could read about and learn.#Statement-non-opinion

that's true.#Agree/Accept
How many people do you supervise?#Wh-Question

Yeah,#Yes answers
I do.#Statement-non-opinion
I love the weather down here.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I loved, I loved Abilene too.#Statement-non-opinion
That's what I liked, too, is the weather.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I know.#Agree/Accept
Except for tornados#Statement-non-opinion
Boy they, they have storms here#Statement-non-opinion
I've,#Uninterpretable
Yes#Agree/Accept
they do.#Agree/Accept
And it, it,#Statement-non-opinion
Hail and thunder and,#Appreciation
it's so surprising how it just happens, you know.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Unpredictable.#Appreciation
Were you here during the hailstorm two years ago?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, no.#No answers
Oh, I've been up here about three.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, we were down there, uh, from eighty-six to, eighty-five to eighty-six,#Statement-non-opinion

well, part of eighty-four to eighty-six I should say.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
boy I had thirty-three hundred dollars damage done on my car,#Statement-non-opinion
a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
I think State Farm went bankrupt.#Statement-opinion
Oh, jeez.#Appreciation
Just about#Other
But, uh,#Uninterpretable
I know the whole situation is bad up here,#Statement-non-opinion
we're having a terrible time with the recession.#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah.#Yes answers
It's not good at all.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know things are pretty booming down there.#Statement-opinion
I heard they sold Johnson City though .#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and Colorado Springs.#Statement-non-opinion
And Colorado Springs?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day#Statement-non-opinion
and he was telling me about it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
They just sold it.#Statement-non-opinion
Amazing.#Appreciation
Closed up and moved down to McKinney.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, well, that's good.#Appreciation
At least they kept the business part of it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's scary though I'm telling you.#Statement-opinion
I know .#Agree/Accept
I don't know,#Hedge
and, well, you know, with the other part of this thing was, how do you feel that this influences family.#Statement-non-opinion
How do I feel what?#Signal-non-understanding
That, that books influence,#Statement-non-opinion
do you know how to use them in your life or to influence,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I feel like it's important for young children to read too.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And what you read to them.#Other
When my children wer-, were younger, of course,#Statement-non-opinion
they were all married and grown#Statement-non-opinion
and I have grandchildren now,#Statement-non-opinion
they were, uh,#Uninterpretable
I, I read to them a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
That's good.#Appreciation
And, uh, I think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also.#Statement-non-opinion
That's re-,#Appreciation
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm not saying they read all the right things#Statement-non-opinion
but they do read. Uh, where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all,#Statement-non-opinion
and I think it's important,#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because, uh, even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens, I mean, they don't learn anything.#Statement-opinion
It's because they can't read.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's really surprising how many people graduate from high school,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that I work with#Other
and people, I mean,#Uninterpretable
I get memos all the time across my desk#Statement-non-opinion
and things are misspelled#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-opinion
Oh, it's be-, unbelievable,#Appreciation
it's really,#Other
isn't it?#Tag-Question
It's pretty sad.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly,#Agree/Accept
and I think that that's why reading is so important,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because, uh, I think even mentally when you can do some,#Statement-opinion

Alright Allen.#Other
Uh, the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations and you know, in their, the society we live in.#Statement-non-opinion
What do you think has occurred there?#Wh-Question
Well, I think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home.#Statement-opinion
That's probably one of the major changes I see over the last period of time.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But are, are they being given the full honor for the work they are doing and for the, uh, oh my gosh, I can't think of the word, but for the, what they have to accept that's they are responsible for.#Rhetorical-Questions
Uh, responsibilities is what I am trying to say.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I don't think so.#Negative non-no answers
I think it has come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals.#Statement-opinion
In other words, in some respects the other direction, in some job markets they don't really want to be treated as equals.#Statement-opinion
By the same token, most, in most cases, women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before, but at lower salaries.#Maybe/Accept-part
Yes#Agree/Accept
I think that's#Agree/Accept
Is that right and wrong?#Yes-No-Question
generally speaking, pretty true.#Other
And I think that's what we really ought to look at that, going is, if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
And that, uh, they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I don't think that we have gotten there yet.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years?#Wh-Question
Any individual thing#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Oh, boy.#Appreciation
or is it just a general switch over?#Or-Clause
I think it's generally that switch over.#Statement-opinion
And, and I think that switch over has been more in the work force.#Statement-opinion
I don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force.#Statement-opinion
I think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that the husband is having them, on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home.#Other
So they have one and three quarters jobs now. Whereas the husbands have one and a quarter.#Statement-opinion
I have a feeling that business with the woman working out at the same level of responsibility as their husband sort of tears into their social or their loving relationship.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In that, uh, the, the lady needs to stand up for what she has made and her own rights and has a right to do so#Other
and this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household.#Statement-opinion
So do you think that is going to be uh, difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other#Yes-No-Question
Yes.#Yes answers
in the future years?#Other
Yeah.#Yes answers
I think also in terms of parenting.#Statement-opinion
I think there is going to be some increasing problem because I think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting#Statement-opinion
and I am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units.#Statement-opinion
Well, do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation,#Yes-No-Question
.#Non-verbal
specifically?#Other
Well, I, I think one of the things that always happens is I think is when the one end wh-, you know were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work#Affirmative non-yes answers
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and then I think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties#Statement-opinion
and so the opinion of this career thing isn't all that it is cracked up to be#Statement-opinion
and I want to go back and do something else.#Statement-opinion
I think we will probably see the sw-, pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Also, much of it is driven by economics right now.#Statement-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
People have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in.#Statement-opinion
Well, I actually, mo-,#Uninterpretable
a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they are going to get.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the people.#Statement-opinion
Well, how do you feel about women in, uh, armed services?#Wh-Question
Well, I think they ought to have the right.#Statement-opinion
I have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to com-, or my wife and my daughter going into combat#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I have problems with men doing that#Statement-opinion
and I guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it.#Statement-opinion
Um.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's nothing I would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I somehow can't do that#Reject
I,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
was brought up in the ages where the ladies were kept home, safe, secure, and made happy#Other
and the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money, bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household#Statement-non-opinion
and it, it really still bothers me.#Statement-non-opinion
I spent plenty of years in the service,#Statement-non-opinion
but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean how are they going to protect themselves so to speak.#Rhetorical-Questions
I agree.#Agree/Accept
It puts them in a very bad situation.#Statement-opinion
I, I really don't go for that.#Statement-opinion
I think one of the other things that concern, has concerned me a little bit,#Statement-opinion
and I think I see some change in attitudes there.#Statement-opinion
My wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and there's, uh, has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence#Statement-non-opinion
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because if she did she would be out in the work force, uh, fulfilling herself.#Other
Well, that's not fair. Because I can tell you one thing, stay home sometime and start doing some of those jobs that she's been handling#Other
and you're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going#Statement-opinion
And I hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do, that's acceptable.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If they chose to go into the work force that's okay.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If they chose not to, that's acceptable.#Statement-opinion
And if they go into the work force, they should be treated as nicely#Statement-opinion
As equals.#Collaborative Completion
as, as well as a man or any other person.#Other
And, uh, not,#Uninterpretable

Okay.#Other
So, uh, what do you think about it?#Open-Question
Well, um, I guess I, I'm more concerned about public safety than I am about the, um, the concern for the private, uh, the idea of,#Statement-non-opinion
Privacy.#Collaborative Completion
preserving privacy for,#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the individual, um,#Other
because I can't really see why anyone, um, who has nothing to hide would object.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, there is always the, uh, the possibility, even remote as it is, of, uh, of mistaken, uh, of,#Statement-non-opinion
That's, of course, that is certainly true,#Appreciation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And see that bothers me.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, I'm a, I mean, I'm, I'm very much for drug testing,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, I really am.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I'm going, I'm going to take the negative side just for a second,#Offers, Options Commits
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just to do it.#Other
Um, see, I have to take, uh, medication for a, uh, for, for kidney transplant.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I'm going to be taking that the rest of my life.#Statement-non-opinion
Now, you,#Uninterpretable
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know how that's going to affect, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
If you had to have a drug test?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean I haven't had one yet.#Statement-non-opinion
Um, T I,#Uninterpretable
I work for Texas Instruments#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, and, uh, we, you know, we do have the random drug testing#Statement-non-opinion
but I've missed it so far.#Statement-non-opinion
But I mean, it, in the back of my mind, it always bothers me.#Statement-non-opinion
And what happens if it, you know, if it, if they catch it,#Statement-non-opinion
they think that I'm, you know, I'm on drugs#Statement-non-opinion
and they send me and, and have me, uh, you know, go through this, this,#Statement-non-opinion
Checked out or whatever.#Collaborative Completion
thing, you know,#Other
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that. Um,#Statement-non-opinion
I agree that, that some innocent person might be victimized,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
by a false test,#Other
but I would think that, um, that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that.#Statement-opinion
For example, that one, uh, positive would not be, uh, accepted as an automatic, um, reason for whatever they might be going,#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
to do if they found a positive, uh, dismissal or treatment or whatever, but that, that what it would do is it would trigger, perhaps, uh, one or two more stages where further tests could be ta-, uh, done.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because, um, there are, there must be people like you, or in other circumstances, that could come up with, with, uh, false positives for certain kind of drugs.#Statement-opinion
On the other hand, um, I think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested#Statement-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because of the, of their responsibility for the public welfare, and certainly people in, uh, industries, well, the transportation industry,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for spe-, uh, you know, specifically.#Other
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um, in many, many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs, it's not even going to effect anybody but his, uh, you know, himself and his own family, perhaps, um, depending on the kind of drug he might be on.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, um, and eventually that's going to show up anyway in the way he works,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and so on.#Other
But there's so many things that it would make a difference.#Statement-opinion
I guess I, I, uh, I would not want to have anyone in my family, uh, victimized by someone who, you know, a, a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that, who, um, you know, hadn't been tested.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, I, you know, I'm, like I said, I'm, I'm very much pro testing, um,#Statement-non-opinion
and, and this is why.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, number one is I, I'm, I'm kind of,#Statement-non-opinion
I know this sounds like a slogan for the government,#Statement-non-opinion
but I, you know, we are in a war against,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
drugs.#Other
I mean#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, it's horrible.#Other
I mean, you don't know whether the person sitting next to you#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
anywhere is on drugs or not,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it takes some drastic steps at this point.#Statement-opinion
And I think, personally, the drastic step has to be that, um, that you can't work if you continue taking drugs.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, it's as simple as that.#Statement-opinion
I mean, make it so,#Statement-opinion
Make it difficult enough.#Collaborative Completion
Well, make it, uh, ma-, not necessarily difficult,#Other
but make it so that it's not glamorous.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, it's glamorous taking drugs,#Statement-opinion
or at least it seems that way.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
according to what you,#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
you hear.#Other
The people who, um, have serious problems, I mean,#Statement-opinion
we have, um,#Uninterpretable
really I guess we're kind of lucky.#Statement-opinion
We really only know of one, uh, young man who, uh, who's a fam-,#Statement-non-opinion
they go to our church,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's the son and so on,#Statement-non-opinion
and he was friends with my children um,#Statement-non-opinion
and he's really the only one that I know of personally who got himself really messed up, um, ha-, having been involved with drugs.#Statement-non-opinion
But I know of a number of other people who have, you know, gotten all messed up.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Most of these are young people.#Statement-non-opinion
I work in the education system#Statement-non-opinion
and so I have a little more contact with that.#Statement-non-opinion
But, um, the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and he may never really be a productive member of society.#Statement-opinion
But sadder than that, he may never be able to have a normal, happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are, are almost uncontrollable.#Statement-opinion
I mean, he, he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that, you know, he, he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, he's, you know, he's so messed up.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, um, this was a nice, sweet, young man who, teenager, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
and he's now a young man about twenty, I guess, who, um, just got really down the wrong path.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, you know, I don't know that, that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing.#Statement-non-opinion
But seeing what drugs did to him makes me see, makes me realize what it could do to people, you know, in the work force as well.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, it's horrible.#Statement-opinion
Well, then,#Uninterpretable
let's, let's answer the second half of the question.#Action-directive
What limits ought to be put on it, do you think?#Wh-Question
Well, the limits, uh, uh, would, I think, have to do with what I'd alluded to before, that there needs to be a further, um, that, that one positive on a drug test,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
would not constitute, uh, dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might, uh, have set up for those who genuinely have a problem.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
In other words, there needs to be, um, more than,#Statement-opinion
Treatment before for dismissal type thing.#Collaborative Completion
Pard-,#Uninterpretable
yes,#Agree/Accept
right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there needs to be more than one test,#Statement-opinion
and there needs to be some, some measure of, uh, certainty before anything drastic happens.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
There are lots of things that are involved there, um, such as, perhaps, insurance#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, you know, denial of insurance for someone, um,#Other
and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this, um, that would, that, you know,#Statement-opinion
it would be unfair,#Statement-opinion
and people who are on medication, for example, or, um, even people who might be of the gay community,#Statement-opinion
and I'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society,#Statement-opinion
but, um, I think that there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Other
because it makes a bigger problem. Um,#Statement-opinion
so it seems to me that, that, um, there needs to be some ground, you know, some rules#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that protect.#Other
I'm not sure, though, when we talk about what rules, if any, that we should say, well, certain segments should not have to be tested.#Statement-opinion
I really don't see why,#Statement-non-opinion
Personally, I think that's what I was about to say#Statement-non-opinion
And, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is that everyone needs to be tested.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't,#Statement-non-opinion
It, you know,#Uninterpretable
I don't know why it would be, you know, uh, bad to test just every-,#Other
and it may be, you know,#Statement-opinion
it's not feasible to do everyone,#Statement-opinion
but certainly random testing, the fact that people know that, that they,#Statement-opinion
That it could happen.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
would be some measure of protection.#Statement-opinion
But the bottom line is that, that if, if you're going to stay clean and straight, then, um, you're, you're going to do that because you want to.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Really.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, there's, yeah, there, there's going to be some measure of incentive, uh, reward or whatever,#Statement-opinion
but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I, I've got to agree with that.#Agree/Accept
.#Non-verbal
So, um,#Uninterpretable
That's very true.#Appreciation
Um.#Uninterpretable
Well, it sounds like we agree, anyway.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think so.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I think we, I think we did pretty good.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, all right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, uh, I guess that's about it.#Statement-opinion
I guess if that's all we've done#Statement-opinion
and I guess we've talked long enough.#Statement-opinion
All right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
It was, it was talk, nice talking to you, too.#Conventional-closing
Okay,#Conventional-closing
bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
All right,#Conventional-closing
bye-bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay.#Other
Uh, go ahead.#Action-directive
What are we supposed to discuss again?#Wh-Question
AIDS research is something that,#Statement-opinion
More money ,#Uninterpretable
that, I think th-, whether our country is putting enough money into it#Other
and actually I'm concerned that they're not.#Statement-non-opinion
I have a friend who is working with, uh, who works with, uh, travel groups,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and one of the ones that he's w-, worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS, uh, conference in, uh, California.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And these were from other, people from other countries.#Statement-non-opinion
He's a translator.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And in talking to the people from France he said, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
he says, one of the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you enough about how it pervasive and frightening this epidemic is.#Statement-non-opinion
And they're letting,#Statement-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the information out slowly about how, you know, how big it is.#Other
Which is scary, you know, pretty scary when so many people get it.#Statement-opinion
So, I guess I'm, I'm, I'd like to see us spend more.#Statement-opinion
I don't know that spending more always gets it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm, I'm ambivalent about it because, um, uh, i-, well it is very frightening and scary.#Statement-opinion
I have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I mean whether,#Uninterpretable
You mean more money for that means less for cancer or,#Summarize/reformulate
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Y-, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, whether those diseases can yo-,#Uninterpretable
some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
didn't, uh, you know,#Uninterpretable
but I, uh,#Uninterpretable
then t-, part of it's lack of education.#Statement-opinion
I don't know whether, whether, you know, where our money would be most effectively spent.#Statement-opinion
Well it,#Uninterpretable
I, I agree with you there#Agree/Accept
because I know every time that i-, something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one#Statement-opinion
and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Money from, money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly,#Statement-opinion
or do they both get served?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, that's a good point.#Statement-opinion
And I'm, I am concerned a lot about, uh, I'm concerned about, uh, two things.#Statement-opinion
One is preventing the spread#Statement-non-opinion
and the other is for, uh, for, uh, treating the illness.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I'm not certain,#Statement-non-opinion
I, I,#Uninterpretable
again this,#Uninterpretable
I'm telling you,#Other
basically I don't have any opinion.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But whether or not it would be, uh, our money would be better spent, uh, teaching, you know, working on the drug problems and the, and the sex problems, uh, rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.#Statement-opinion
Well, and one of the things I'd,#Uninterpretable
and I'm with you that I don't know is, is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, you know,#Uninterpretable
That's, that's the part that,#Uninterpretable
t-, d-, whether my dentist or#Uninterpretable
That's the part that scares me, you know.#Statement-opinion
I mean beginning with this is, this is just for homosexuals,#Statement-non-opinion
well no,#Quotation
it's for homosexuals and gays,#Quotation
well no,#Quotation
actually, it's,#Quotation
I mean, you know.#Hedge
Did they know that all along?#Rhetorical-Questions
An-, and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about mosquitoes.#Statement-non-opinion
And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not.#Statement-non-opinion
Can't get it from mosquitoes.#Quotation
And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions,#Statement-non-opinion
yes.#Quotation
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I don't know that's true or not.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I just heard it in passing,#Statement-non-opinion
but so what does that,#Wh-Question
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and#Wh-Question
And how is it really transmitted,#Wh-Question
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
et cetera.#Other
Which is, I think, what they also don't know.#Statement-opinion
I mean that's,#Uninterpretable
I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway,#Statement-opinion
but, but that isn't how it was in Africa.#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Agree/Accept
In Africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that,#Statement-non-opinion
and it's huge over there.#Statement-non-opinion
So I, I, you know,#Uninterpretable
and it's beginning, t-, other countries#Uninterpretable
that's what's his point.#Statement-non-opinion
This was an international,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this.#Other
And does that mean like flus and everything else, there are all these different strains of it?#Rhetorical-Questions
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean I don't know.#Statement-non-opinion
All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know.#Statement-opinion
Uh, or maybe they understand but,#Statement-opinion
I think maybe more information should be given out about it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and, uh, and then the people that have it,#Statement-non-opinion
it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back.#Statement-opinion
If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care.#Statement-opinion
I, I, give me cyanide.#Action-directive
I mean, is it ,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'll take anything#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know.#Other
I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying,#Statement-opinion
Ri-,#Uninterpretable
you can experiment on me.#Other
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Go ahead.#Action-directive
And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, i-, if these people knowingly consent to be,#Rhetorical-Questions
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
research monkeys and well, let them,#Other
let them,#Action-directive
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
do it.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that's what I think they're saying too.#Statement-opinion

Okay.#Other
Okay.#Other
Well, uh, anyways, I'm not exactly sure#Statement-non-opinion
I, I wasn't really, uh, paying attention as to what particular, uh, parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about,#Statement-non-opinion
but it was, uh, basically what's your views on, whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used, that sort of thing?#Open-Question
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, I don't know,#Hedge
I've, I've always thought that any, uh, crime that, uh, that, uh, intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life would be the ones where I think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps, uh, doing it again, and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that, you know, there's a, a very steep penalty to, uh, be paid#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when that's done,#Other
and, uh. Yeah,#Uninterpretable
how do you feel about it?#Open-Question
Uh, I believe in it, too#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I'm Catholic#Statement-non-opinion
and we're not supposed to,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I feel that it,#Uninterpretable
like you,#Uninterpretable
you know, on the premeditated murders I feel if you're, you know, I mean, if it's beyond a doubt that you did it, you know#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I would say go ahead and execute that person as well.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, it's the cases, you know, like sometimes you, you know, you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely, you know,#Statement-opinion
they really didn't do it.#Statement-opinion
Well, you know, you, you got, you got that point well, h-, you know, what, what if a mistake is made and you put someone, you know, to death that really didn't do it.#Rhetorical-Questions
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
exactly.#Agree/Accept
There's always that chance,#Statement-opinion
I don't know,#Hedge
but, I would say that, you know, for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated, it would be kind of hard for, you know,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know what I'm saying?#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Like,#Uninterpretable
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If, if the evidence wasn't overwhelming, right?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, uh, I,#Uninterpretable
Well, I think that should be likewise decided by the jury, you know, because, I don't know, I think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for, any reason,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it.#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Uh, I'm not sure about Pennsylvania, whether we have it or not.#Statement-non-opinion
For some reason I was thinking that we do,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's, you know, it's not very often.#Statement-opinion
I think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that, that anyone#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't think we,#Uninterpretable
anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it.#Other
I don't,#Uninterpretable
do you know if Virginia has it?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
huh-uh.#No answers
No#No answers
we don't.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know Florida has it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Oh, yeah#Uninterpretable
.#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
they're always in Florida.#Statement-non-opinion
Florida and Louisiana, I think, and, uh, some of the,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
other southern states.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Course they have such a crime problem because they have such a un-, unemployment rate.#Statement-opinion
Uh, you know,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Get that unemployment way up#Statement-opinion
so then people, you know tend towards crime,#Statement-opinion
and then they they start stiffening the penalties.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it's funny that, uh,#Statement-opinion
I mean, like, you know, like I said I think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania.#Statement-opinion
I'm not even sure of that,#Hedge
but for some reason I think that, you know, it was something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
And, it surprised,#Uninterpretable
and even Florida, I know they have it,#Statement-non-opinion
and you don't really hear about it real often, how many people,#Statement-opinion
Well, in Florida seems like, uh, two or three times a year.#Statement-opinion
It's constantly on the,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but, you, you think that,#Uninterpretable
I mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, compared to that and to how many people are being sent, that doesn't seem like very many.#Other
No,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Appreciation
Course they have a requirement that, uh, that every single appeal must be permitted.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, of course, the, the attorneys,#Statement-opinion
Everyone would appeal.#Statement-opinion
take them through the whole chain.#Other
That's true, too.#Appreciation
You know, even if the case is open and closed,#Other
they go all the way up to the Supreme Court, you know.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They almost always get thrown right back out again,#Statement-opinion
but they have to have every single appeal made open to them.#Statement-opinion
And, you know, it's sort of strange because it almost it almost seems like the attorneys are doing it for the money or something because, I mean, the guy knows that, whether it's, you know, a, a month or two, or six years, he's still going to get, you know, the chair when it comes around#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Some of these guys are really, uh, you know, violent Son of Sam killers and stuff like that, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, they,#Uninterpretable
And then they get out.#Statement-opinion
everyone knows they're going get, not going to get out.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they get out in three years on probation,#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they do it again, you know.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's like a slap on the fingers for them.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't, I don't, e-, e-, I don't,#Uninterpretable
I think that it should be,#Statement-opinion
I mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone, a murder, then I think, you know, that they should likewise, you know, someone should take their life also.#Statement-opinion
But, uh, but, are, are you, would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder?#Yes-No-Question
I think so.#Affirmative non-yes answers
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, a lot of the, the, the other violent crimes I don't really feel that strongly about.#Statement-non-opinion
Although, you know, stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean, these guys are certainly not going to, uh, be,#Statement-opinion
they can't,#Uninterpretable
I mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't think the parole system is really helping that much#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Reduce the violence in the prisons.#Action-directive
I think that's its only purpose#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
is, is, you know, to reduce, uh, the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Off earlier.#Other
But some of these guys just don't care,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
you know.#Other
And so, uh,#Uninterpretable
I think some of them would rather be in jail#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
They probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets.#Statement-opinion
Um, that's possible I guess.#Statement-opinion
I don't know, uh,#Hedge
I was just going to say something,#Hold before answer/agreement
I forgot what it was.#Hold before answer/agreement
Oh, I don't even remember what it was now.#Hold before answer/agreement
Um, so where do you live in Pennsylvania?#Wh-Question
In Clarion.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, I live in Butler,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'm at c-, I'm at college.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm at Clarion University.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
I don't think I really know that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
Because, uh, you know,#Uninterpretable
that all depends, too, on where you are at.#Statement-opinion
That's, uh, sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are. Because the more grass root country, uh, parts of the country tend to, to support capital punishment, where the places that are, you know, less in contact with crime#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, the, the more, more urban, I mean less,#Other
See, yeah,#Uninterpretable
okay,#Uninterpretable
well, see, I'm, I'm in kind, I'm in kind,#Uninterpretable
okay, uh,#Uninterpretable
we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that would be pushing it.#Statement-opinion
So, I mean this is definitely a college town.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, we're about two hours north of Pittsburgh if that would help you out any. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Two hours where?#Signal-non-understanding
North of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
Near Polk?#Yes-No-Question
Oh, I've never heard of Polk#Other answers
but,#Uninterpretable
Polk Institute.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, uh, an old, uh, university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I never heard of that.#Statement-non-opinion
Very old, uh, historical place there.#Statement-non-opinion
It might have a new name.#Statement-non-opinion
Sharon, Pennsylvania's up there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
We're probably about an hour away from Sharon.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, so, I,#Uninterpretable
most of the kids here, I, you know,#Uninterpretable
like, you know, just from dorm mates and stuff, they'll say that they don't believe in it,#Statement-non-opinion
but then after I would say my point of view, then they'll say, well, yeah,#Statement-non-opinion
you know, da-, you know.#Uninterpretable
In that case, maybe, you know.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
You know, I think people can be persuaded one way or another.#Statement-opinion
I've never seriously ran into someone, I mean like, other than my priest, you know, who definitely says you can't take a, you know, you can't take anyone's life.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's true.#Appreciation
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
well, it, it, you know,#Uninterpretable
you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have, you know, stolen kids and, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
done terrible things to them and killed them and, you know, that sort of thing,#Other
you just#Uninterpretable
like, I don't want that person sharing the Earth with me, you know,#Statement-opinion
I mean, that is just#Statement-opinion
Exac-,#Appreciation
yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
terrible.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, you know, we had a case like that here#Statement-non-opinion
and, on the other hand, you know, people are saying that because the, he knows, because the criminals know that the, uh, penalties can be very severe,#Statement-non-opinion
they, uh,#Uninterpretable
there's less criminals that are, you know, turning themselves in, or, you know, pleading or whatever, because they know that the judge, you know, if they find them guilty is, you know, has the, the opportunity to sentence them, you know, for, for the death sentence.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but you know I look at that and say, well, they should have thought about that beforehand.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Other
Well, I'm just saying that, that, that's what, the, the client, lawyers are saying.#Statement-non-opinion
They're saying that, you know, you know, more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to, to, to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what the sentence is going to be.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You can plea bargain what you're guilty of, but, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But not how they're going to sentence you ,#Other
That's something, you know#Statement-opinion
but, uh, wh-, whether they plea bargain or not, if they're guilty of murder, they're guilty of murder, you know.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So I don't think that they deserve anything less#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It's just,#Uninterpretable
I don't, I don't know,#Hedge
I just#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was just saying that way,#Statement-non-opinion
what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then.#Statement-non-opinion
And so, we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that costs money, yeah.#Statement-non-opinion
And perhaps we can#Statement-non-opinion
and perhaps we can't#Statement-non-opinion
and so the guy might get off.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are, are guys that are, you know going to get caught anyways#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
There's always a few of those people that are, you know, lost their head or whatever.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Anyways, but, uh. Yeah,#Uninterpretable
we just had a terrible case in Virginia where some girl disappeared#Statement-non-opinion
and, and the guy, like I said, he just, uh, said that he took her,#Statement-non-opinion
but he won't admit that she died or whatever,#Statement-non-opinion
and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very s-, s-, you know, mandatory life sentences for murder.#Statement-non-opinion

Well, I, I don't think that it's, it's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions.#Statement-non-opinion
For instance, jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's, where there's, uh, endangerment to their own life and other people's lives.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I agree with that.#Agree/Accept
People that are, uh, driving#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like, uh, truck drivers and things like that.#Other
I definitely think they should be tested.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'm not, I'm not opposed to any testing.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean because I know I certainly wouldn't want to, to, uh, you know, be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or, or you know, because he was on drugs while he was there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh ...#Uninterpretable
Well, how do you, how do you feel about, uh, companies drug testing prior to hiring?#Open-Question
Oh, uh, I was tested, uh, within my company.#Statement-non-opinion
I think it's kind of a push to, uh, weed out drugs in states#Statement-non-opinion
and, because I don't know of any other countries that are doing this#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I, I feel like it's really just within the United States.#Statement-non-opinion
It's, uh, it's okay.#Statement-non-opinion
I think your record should stand for itself. That, you know, if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever, then I don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of testing you over and over and over.#Other
And once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not. I think they could, uh, save money by not doing that. You know, every time,#Statement-non-opinion
say if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, what about random testing, though.#Declarative Wh-Question
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Do you feel like that's an in-, invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, not if it's done fairly.#Negative non-no answers
And that's probably my question is, how, how do you know it's done fairly.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know that you do.#Statement-opinion
If it's random, then it's random#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's not necessarily fair.#Statement-opinion
Well, they might tell you it's random.#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But then, you know, it's kind of like a, a lottery.#Statement-opinion
Somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything, and tries and tries and tries.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know.#Other
Well, I ha-, I know that, for instance, in the N C double A, they drug test#Statement-non-opinion
and it's not random.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
How'd, how did they, how do they pick their people?#Wh-Question
Uh, well, I think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and from that point on, uh, at, the N C double A does have something to do with it,#Statement-non-opinion
but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each in-, individu-, individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Response Acknowledgement
So, do you ...#Uninterpretable
And, and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, do you think that should be implemented in the work place. You know, as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs,#Yes-No-Question
do you think they should have the right to send them#Yes-No-Question
Well, not being a#Affirmative non-yes answers
to be tested.#Other
drug user I don't have a problem with that personally#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
but I think that might be a violation of someone's rights.#Statement-opinion
If someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to h-, behave differently#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and their manager assumes they have a drug problem#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
I mean if someone assumed that of me, I would be upset.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it, it would almost be like a, a, uh ...#Uninterpretable
It's an accusation,#Statement-opinion
and, and it's#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it's based on, on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave, uh, normal, uh, you know.#Other
And then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and, you know, your supervisor has accused you of using drugs.#Rhetorical-Questions
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
exactly.#Agree/Accept
I, I don't,#Uninterpretable
the, I think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from, from the janitors to the executive management.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I agree with that.#Agree/Accept
Because I know personally myself, I've been in the same job for three years,#Statement-non-opinion
it will be three years in August#Statement-non-opinion
and I've already been drug tested three times.#Statement-non-opinion
What type of job do you have?#Wh-Question
Well, I'm an environmental engineer#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and I've been drug tested three times#Statement-non-opinion
and I know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime#Statement-non-opinion
and the company I work for is sixty thousand people, plus.#Statement-non-opinion
So see I, for some reason, I've come up three times.#Statement-non-opinion
That's pretty high statistics.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, does your r-, does your job require you to drive company equipment or to ap-, operate any type of machinery that might#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
endanger someone?#Other
No,#No answers
not at all.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, that doesn't,#Uninterpretable
I mean I ...#Uninterpretable
It's a legal job, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so, see it's really strange.#Statement-opinion
That is odd.#Appreciation
I was drug tested, uh, not for the job I have now, but for the prior job, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
but I know that they sent, that the job I had before, that, well,#Statement-non-opinion
the job I have, have now, requested my, uh, uh, my, uh, medical record from my old company#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, does your, the company say, for instance, does the company you worked for bef-, before have the right or do they have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her#Yes-No-Question
and she came up negative.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, no,#No answers
I don't think they can, they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I, I#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
didn't, I mean,#Other
they don't know that I don't use drugs.#Statement-non-opinion
They just tested me once.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, I used to work for a power company,#Statement-non-opinion
so it was very important that they make sure their employees, especially linemen#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, were clean.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And since I was just, you know, one of the office folk, I guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly.#Statement-non-opinion
But I know they test most of the service people fairly regularly#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
reg-, uh, just across the board.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And are they tested random?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
they're,#Uninterpretable
all of them are tested#Statement-non-opinion
They're ...#Uninterpretable
once every three mo-,#Other
it's a rotation.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, okay.#Response Acknowledgement
I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But it,#Uninterpretable
but again, it depends on what job you're in.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot#Statement-non-opinion
and the men that drive the trucks#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
with, with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, but see, they make that clear to them as they hire those guys#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, I see.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
what, what the drug testing schedule is.#Other
They say we, we're testing you tomorrow#Statement-non-opinion
and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here.#Quotation
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so they know that.#Statement-non-opinion
And that's ...#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's, it's made very clear upon hiring.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well ...#Uninterpretable
Well, have we spent our at least five minutes?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah#Yes answers
Okay.#Response Acknowledgement
I think so.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
seven twenty-five.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Okay,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
nice speaking to you.#Conventional-closing
Nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Bye-bye#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing

Okay,#Other
uh, so what do you think about the school system?#Open-Question
Well, I think they're, they're having a lot of trouble right now.#Statement-opinion
I know my son goes to a private school,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I think they're, big city public schools by definition are having a, a tough time right now just from, uh, probably from budget cuts and, and everything else going on.#Statement-opinion
Uh, why did you choose a private school?#Wh-Question
Well, I had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a, at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school,#Statement-non-opinion
so#Statement-non-opinion
Public school.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
he's, he has been going to private since kindergarten#Other
Oh, has he?#Backchannel in question form
So,#Uninterpretable
Then how does he like it?#Open-Question
Oh, he's loved it.#Statement-non-opinion
He is a senior in high school this year#Statement-non-opinion
so#Uninterpretable
So#Declarative Yes-No-Question
he's,#Other
he's been there all the time.#Other
Yeah,#Yes answers
he's done it the whole twelve and, uh, so many years#Statement-non-opinion
and it's been, uh, it's been really good for him.#Statement-non-opinion
How big of a school is it?#Wh-Question
Uh, overall on campus about twelve hundred, but in the upper school, upper four grades, uh, about four hundred and something#Statement-non-opinion
so it's maybe a hundred per grade.#Statement-non-opinion
A hundred per grade, that's a good size.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
it really is.#Agree/Accept
Kind of gives them the, you know,#Statement-opinion
I get a little leery of the real small ones that they don't get much interaction with kids#Statement-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that was, we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture#Statement-non-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
So they don't,#Uninterpretable
he's done, he's done#Other
That's good.#Appreciation
really well,#Other
and just, he was just ahead at an early age#Statement-non-opinion
and I didn't feel like, uh, in, what was available, particularly in the first three grades#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program.#Statement-non-opinion
Huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I just didn't think that was going get it.#Statement-non-opinion
I thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead, uh, every day.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But yet still be with his peers#Other
Still enjoy the,#Uninterpretable
age wise.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, one thing I think I've noticed is, uh, my oldest is in kindergarten,#Statement-non-opinion
so I'm in a little different#Statement-opinion
You're just#Statement-opinion
ballgame.#Other
getting started.#Other
I'm just,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
starting her,#Other
but, uh, seems to me that, uh, kids these days, uh, can really get away with murder#Statement-opinion
and the teachers don't have as much, aren't respected as much#Statement-opinion
and, uh, they have to be so careful of the things they do and say.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I know.#Agree/Accept
That's#Statement-opinion
And, uh, makes me#Statement-non-opinion
a big problem.#Other
a little nervous that, uh, students don't seem to show that respect#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
We wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we#Statement-opinion
No!#Agree/Accept
were in school.#Other
Heavens,#Appreciation
no.#Agree/Accept
Wouldn't have thought of it#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
you wouldn't.#Agree/Accept
and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
And, uh, the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what I understand, uh,#Statement-opinion
I think that's wrong.#Statement-opinion
I think we need to get back to the, show some respect#Statement-opinion
and, course, I guess the teacher used to warrant that#Statement-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
anymore like it used to be, basic respect for#Other
For other people#Collaborative Completion
for elders#Other
and,#Uninterpretable
and adults and particularly in, in responsible positions have not, uh, I don't think have, had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases#Other
and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands.#Statement-opinion
Well, how do you think that that's happened?#Open-Question
You think our society's just, uh, stopped talking out,#Statement-opinion
or this, uh#Statement-opinion
I guess, I,#Uninterpretable
generation's just kind of changed a little bit, uh,#Other
Well, the world changes,#Statement-opinion
so I mean, obviously, kids are not the same now as they used to be.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things.#Statement-opinion
They have a whole lot more, uh, variety of things they they're, that they see and do at an earlier age,#Statement-opinion
so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time,#Statement-opinion
but, but still, I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to, to teach, uh, basic values and basic, uh, respectful of, uh, -ness of authority.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I just don't think that this#Statement-opinion
That just isn't coming through#Collaborative Completion
doesn't always get emphasized#Other
is it.#Other
anymore, uh,#Other
No.#Agree/Accept
I mean, I remember, uh, well, it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi's.#Statement-non-opinion
We used to have to wear#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
had to wear#Yes-No-Question
dresses#Other
dresses, didn't you?#Other
and then you had to, a-, go to dresses,#Statement-non-opinion
they had to be a pantsuit#Statement-non-opinion
and it was polyester#Statement-non-opinion
and it had to be matching#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
And when it was skirts, it was like, get down on the floor#Statement-non-opinion
and we hold the ruler up here#Statement-non-opinion
Yes.#Agree/Accept
and it's no#Statement-non-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
more than so many inches above the knee#Other
Yes.#Agree/Accept
Because it was mini skirt time back there at one time.#Statement-non-opinion
Yes,#Agree/Accept
so it's really changed.#Statement-opinion
It's, uh, really kind of gone the rounds,#Statement-opinion
so I think that maybe that's effected it to some degree.#Statement-opinion
They say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit,#Statement-non-opinion
so I,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
I think that probably does have, have something to do with it,#Agree/Accept
and it's also,#Uninterpretable
Do, uh, does this school your son goes to, do they, uh, re-, require to wear a uniform#Yes-No-Question
or,#Uninterpretable
No,#No answers
they do not do uniforms, although one, where he was between like second and eighth grade#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
did.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there are quite a few of your s-,#Uninterpretable

Okay.#Other
What do you think about it?#Open-Question
Uh, well, immigration,#Statement-non-opinion
I know they're really strict right now because my hundr-, husband is from out of the country#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, we had to go through a whole, very long process to, uh, to, assure the government that he was, uh, marrying me#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and not to be a resident here.#Other
That's interest-,#Statement-opinion
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's, uh, I think it's a little crazy.#Statement-opinion
I worked with Spanish people#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
for about two years#Other
and just, it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Agree/Accept
I mean, you can't just come over to the country because, uh, you want to.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, that's not good enough.#Statement-opinion
You have to have a, have to have a darn good reason of, political or whatever.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
Not a good, not a good easy way to get in.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think, you know, I think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to, to protect, you know, the people who are in the states.#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
My mother, uh, actually knew a woman in another state that used to marry men#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just,#Other
n-, she'd never even meet them#Statement-non-opinion
and she'd just get money for it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, you're kidding.#Backchannel in question form
Huh-uh.#No answers
So, uh,#Uninterpretable
.#Non-verbal
.#Non-verbal
Sounds like a lot of fun.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
it's amazing to me how, how many things they would allow to occur before, you know, you can come in.#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
But, I mean, with the new laws, it's#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's tough now.#Other
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it's kind of frustrating, too, for those who are legitimate now.#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
You know, I think,#Uninterpretable
Well, and, you know, uh, my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life, you know#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and they got here,#Statement-non-opinion
but now it's a, you know, it's so strict that you can't just do that.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
exactly.#Agree/Accept
And I think it's important that they, you know, they allow a good number of people in every year#Statement-opinion
because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that, that we don't want to do.#Statement-opinion
I agree.#Agree/Accept
And I just,#Uninterpretable
I don't know,#Hedge
I have, personally I have a problem with it,#Statement-non-opinion
I think, that, you know, if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
we shouldn't close our door.#Other
If they're not going to be on welfare or, or, or whatever.#Statement-opinion
They're going to be a productive citizen Zen.#Statement-opinion
And, you know, I, I believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when, you, you know, send them back to their country.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, I think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in#Statement-opinion
and,#Uninterpretable
Well, think of how many illegal aliens have, have, have been, uh, uh, sent back to Mexico just to find their way back.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and that's, that's what I think.#Statement-opinion
You know, I, I have to laugh#Statement-non-opinion
because, like I said, I worked with a lot of those#Statement-non-opinion
and they'd been deported two or three times#Statement-non-opinion
and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for Christmas.#Statement-non-opinion
That's right,#Statement-opinion
that's our money.#Statement-opinion
Or for any other time.#Other
Yes,#Agree/Accept
that's true.#Statement-opinion
But, I think, you know, I think all in all there's a lot of improvements.#Statement-opinion
I think the general idea is good#Statement-opinion
but, but there could be some work done in the area.#Statement-opinion
I, I think#Uninterpretable
I, I agree.#Agree/Accept
Well good#Appreciation
.#Non-verbal
Anyway, do you have anything else in the, the subject, uh#Yes-No-Question
Uh, I, uh,#Uninterpretable
boy#Appreciation
that you might want to talk about?#Other
this is spur of the moment, uh,#Hedge
but, I, I don't really see any, any changes that I think of really blatant right now#Statement-opinion
other than I think they ought to take, you know, on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a, uh, political refugee.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
absolutely.#Agree/Accept
I think a lot of times we take, you know, basically who we want to#Statement-opinion
because if you, if you have connections, it's a lot easier to get in.#Statement-opinion
Exactly.#Agree/Accept
Connections and money.#Collaborative Completion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
and I think, you know, it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And that it should be equal to all#Other
and then not like the United States,#Statement-opinion
basically, it's not who you know,#Statement-opinion
it d-, it doesn't become a thing of who you know, but, but how the type of person you are.#Statement-opinion
I agree.#Agree/Accept
And it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people, like probably your husband, can get in#Statement-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, we got him past that,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, great.#Appreciation
I know there's a lot of other people out there,#Statement-opinion
.#Non-verbal
would probably do a good job here.#Other
Yep.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well, let's see,#Hold before answer/agreement
is there anything I believe in#Yes-No-Question
I think that's it.#Statement-opinion
Is this like a very short call?#Yes-No-Question
No,#No answers
I'm not sure how long they're supposed to be,#Statement-non-opinion
but, I've enjoyed it.#Statement-non-opinion
It's good hearing your, your point of view#Statement-non-opinion
and I think that's neat.#Statement-opinion
I think we agree a lot on that#Statement-opinion
and#Statement-non-opinion
I did, too.#Agree/Accept
I've learned something from it.#Other
Well, it was nice talking to you.#Conventional-closing
Well, thanks,#Thanking
I'm glad you're home.#Conventional-closing
You have a good evening, all right?#Conventional-closing
You, too.#Conventional-closing
Thanks,#Thanking
bye-bye.#Conventional-closing
Bye.#Conventional-closing

Are you a T I -er?#Yes-No-Question
Uh, yeah,#Yes answers
I am.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, good.#Response Acknowledgement
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, she#Statement-non-opinion
been, uh,#Other
had a hard time getting a few folks, uh,#Other
I thought, well every, all these T I -ers have gone home, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh,#Uninterpretable
at one o'clock on Friday.#Other
It is Friday,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
that's for sure.#Appreciation
Well, uh, I guess,#Uninterpretable
I'm trying to think the last thing I did to a car.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I, I do it a lot.#Statement-non-opinion
I have,#Uninterpretable
I kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, wow.#Appreciation
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, so, and my father and brother were in it#Statement-non-opinion
and, and my brother's still in it.#Statement-non-opinion
And I had periods when I didn't do anything,#Statement-non-opinion
but in the last ten years I've, uh, my car doesn't go to a shop, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
it, it,#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just do it all.#Statement-non-opinion
Do,#Uninterpretable
I, uh,#Uninterpretable
there's hardly anything that, other than putting tires on, that I'll do.#Statement-non-opinion
I#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but,#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I change the oil and transmission#Other
and, uh, uh, I do, essentially do it all.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know, uh, uh, if there's anything specific.#Statement-non-opinion
In fact, I could advise people, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
I happen to be a M E besides.#Statement-non-opinion
But#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I do it for fun really and to save#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
money.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I guess that's diversion.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, I, I've, I've tried a few groups, uh, you know, where you,#Statement-non-opinion
I can recommend it for people to take their cars.#Statement-non-opinion
Like I think Sears is probably the best place#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
because,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I've heard, when I used to go there and when I,#Other
I just overheard what they did for me, very little because I didn't take it that much.#Statement-non-opinion
But what I heard them tell other people was always right.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know, when I sat there, I, you know, I dropped my car off for tires or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so I respect,#Statement-non-opinion
they seem to actually have mechanics there.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was pretty impressed with Western Auto,#Statement-non-opinion
but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission, uh, oil last time.#Statement-non-opinion
And when#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
when I did it the next time, I realized the filter was loose and everything,#Other
and I didn't like it.#Statement-non-opinion
So I'm just doing it all myself.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That's, that's the aggravating thing.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
I, I try to do as much as I can.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh, I grew up on farm so I've got that, uh, you know, take care of yourself attitude.#Statement-non-opinion
You had to do it.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
right.#Uninterpretable
And, uh, oh, I've done, I've done various things.#Statement-non-opinion
I've got an, I've got an eighty-three T Bird#Statement-non-opinion
and I've, I've#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
changed out, uh, heater core and,#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, oh, timing belts and things like that.#Other
Um, I guess the last thing I took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car, um, when we went in for inspection.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It didn't, it didn't quite pass.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So we had to have, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
that's, uh, that's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out, to get to it.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
Well, you like Fords, apparently, huh?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
yeah.#Yes answers
I've, uh, I'm kind of stuck on them right now, I guess.#Statement-non-opinion
But, you know, that's,#Uninterpretable
it's partially because I can work on them.#Statement-non-opinion
That's, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's, that's, that's a big part of my decision.#Other
But, uh, yeah,#Uninterpretable
we ran into some problems with, uh, having them to work on that carburetor.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, they get, they got everything tuned up right, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
But they,#Uninterpretable
we got, I got it home,#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, and they had left the, uh, oil f-, uh, cap off and it was rubbing#Statement-non-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
on a belt#Other
and it rubbed a notch in that.#Statement-non-opinion
My goodness.#Appreciation
Li-, little things like that, that really start to aggravate you.#Statement-opinion
That, that's a lot of the reason I do my own stuff.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I won-, always wonder when you have little things like that happen, why, even here at T I, why we don't inspect, I'm in facilities, why we don't inspect areas and, and guarantee it so to speak. Uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we always fix things and rep-, put things in and walk away.#Statement-non-opinion
We,#Uninterpretable
there needs to be a time of inspection and check out.#Statement-opinion
And, and s-, thing like that with a car,#Uninterpretable
there ought to be someone there that inspects it before it's turned.#Statement-opinion
There ought to be an insp-, inspector or quality insurance guy#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
after, after an oil change, you know.#Other
Sure,#Other
that's#Appreciation
Just#Statement-opinion
right.#Other
in case, uh, they didn't put the oil in or whatever.#Other
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
i-,#Uninterpretable
I, I always wonder about that when, when someone does repairs or little things like that, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Any, anything that gets, that, that's in a, gets to be an, an assembly line type operation,#Statement-non-opinion
you're, you're always risking that.#Statement-opinion
If there's, too many people that get their hands on one little project, you know, that things, they're, you get, y-, you miss that overlap#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sometimes,#Other
and, and they miss things.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Uninterpretable
I've, I've had a hard time finding anybody I can trust.#Statement-non-opinion
Like, like you say, it, it, well, transmissions and things like that.#Statement-non-opinion
I'm, obviously, I'm not going to, I'm not going to tear apart a automatic transmission#Statement-non-opinion
No,#Agree/Accept
no,#Agree/Accept
and try rebuild it.#Other
I don't either.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't either,#Statement-non-opinion
yeah.#Uninterpretable
But, uh, i-, it, it's, it's real stressful to try to find anybody that I think's going to do me right.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and, uh, you know, have an idea of what's going on.#Other
You need to really, uh,#Statement-opinion
I, I do, uh, a lot of the simple things.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I think I do most of the things better than the average person.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You, you have Fords and I, I, uh, I have three Chevys, which#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I worked my way into having the same engine.#Statement-non-opinion
I don't know how long I'm,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I like a V-eight.#Statement-non-opinion
And I'm, I'm,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
s-, sold on small block Chevy V-eights.#Other
And I,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I bought one car new,#Other
and I almost accidentally got the next car, although I was kind of looking for it when I got a u-, a used car with the same engine.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Well then the nex-, the truck I got next, I definitely looked for the same engine.#Statement-non-opinion
So I buy filters, you know, three or four at a time.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And essentially#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the engines are different#Other
y-,#Uninterpretable
the cars are different years, but the same Chevy V-eight.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And the par-, the carburetors is the same.#Statement-non-opinion
Almost everything is the same.#Statement-non-opinion
Th-, the course is two are eighties and one eighty-six, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So you can learn a lot that way.#Statement-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
there's no way I could, I could fix every car in the world, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That, that,#Uninterpretable
the biggest, you know, that's the three biggest things to me, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
I-,#Uninterpretable
i-,#Uninterpretable
number one, you've got to have the tools around.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
If you don't have the, the special tools or,#Statement-opinion
well, any more#Uninterpretable
the, the testers, that, you know.#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I, I don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in my garage, you know.#Other
So obviously if it starts, my car starts missing or something like that, th-, it's almost impossible to track that down any more#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
without a diagnostics.#Other
But at the tools and the space to do it, that, that can be a big problem if it's, if it's under carriage or something like that.#Statement-non-opinion
But, then it's experience.#Statement-non-opinion
You know, you can, you can look through a, a Chilton's book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it.#Statement-opinion
But you better figure on multiplying that time out, about by at least by five or so.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Ju-, just, just by not knowing, you know, how to get to that, that one bolt or that one#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
screw or whatever to get things apart.#Other
That was, that was the biggest thing when I did, uh, the heater core in my T Bird.#Statement-non-opinion
That is got to be the worst location for it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, and the only reason I did it,#Statement-non-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
I think they're all bad, really.#Statement-opinion
They're,#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The, the only ones I've ever heard good, good things about are, are the old Lincolns and Cadillacs where#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
they had the little door underneath the hood.#Other
You just open the door and pop it out.#Statement-non-opinion
Is that right?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
But, but, uh, I, I had, I had taken this in to have it done originally.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh,#Uninterpretable
What did they want to charge you for it?#Wh-Question
Oh, it, it was, it was tremend-,#Uninterpretable
well it was about seven hours labor.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So it, it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they looked it over and they, they, they thought they could patch it up a little bit, you know, and what not.#Statement-non-opinion
So they,#Uninterpretable
This is your little water, uh, heater in there, for the, uh,#Quotation
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
the heat inside?#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it was, it was leaking inside the car,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
in the condenser unit.#Other
So, uh, they, they did a little patch on it,#Statement-non-opinion
and it l-, it held for about four to six months.#Statement-non-opinion
And I finally went back in and started looking at it myself.#Statement-non-opinion
And i-, it's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff,#Statement-non-opinion
but,#Uninterpretable
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
hey,#Other
it was not, uh, it was not a seven hour labor#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
job for me.#Other
It was about a week before I finally#Statement-non-opinion
Did you get it#Yes-No-Question
through.#Other
inside or outside?#Other
I, I took one off my little Buick I had,#Statement-non-opinion
and I pretty much took it loose on the inside.#Statement-non-opinion
But it came out from the, you know, underneath the hood.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It came from,#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Yes answers
No,#No answers
this, this was,#Uninterpretable
the only thing that sticks, in, inside the engine compartment on this are the two, uh, hose fittings.#Statement-non-opinion
Maybe you're right,#Statement-opinion
maybe you're right.#Statement-opinion
I,#Uninterpretable
it's been a long time since I took one out.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It, it's,#Uninterpretable
I, I've never heard a good story about, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
Course, I broke mine, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
so I'm always very careful when I change hoses on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know whether you did yours.#Declarative Yes-No-Question
Not to really pull on those.#Uninterpretable
I,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when I take those hoses, I cut them off#Other
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
very gingerly.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Because if you sp-, you know, pull on that,#Statement-opinion
and I've always done that as a kid, you know, just yanked on it.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time.#Statement-non-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But I broke one on my, on my Buick.#Statement-non-opinion
And I always remembered it was my own fault,#Statement-non-opinion
and I thought, well I'm going to t-, going to carefully take those hoses off.#Statement-non-opinion
You bet.#Appreciation
Well that, that's what ended up being the real problem on this, was the, uh, i-, the, the pipe wasn't busted,#Statement-non-opinion
but the,#Uninterpretable
it wasn't soldered in good enough.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, really?#Backchannel in question form
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And it had, it had broken loose enough to where if it got hot,#Statement-non-opinion
It, it spread out,#Collaborative Completion
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and just normal driving didn't do it.#Statement-non-opinion
But if, if, if it was an especially hot day, the pressure would get high enough#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
and it would start blowing the water out inside.#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
It was real aggravating,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I, I, couldn't eve-, even#Uninterpretable
a week's, a week's time is, is worth a whole lot less than, four, than four hundred dollars to me, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
than to have somebody else do it.#Other
Sometimes if you're a tinkerer, you luck out.#Statement-opinion
My wife's,#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
uh, Chevy, uh, it was a Caprice, air conditioning stopped.#Other
I, I just heard it.#Statement-non-opinion
I realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I went out there for five minutes,#Statement-non-opinion
and I just pushed on the wires.#Statement-non-opinion
And sure enough, just pure dumb luck, that the connection over by,#Statement-non-opinion
it's not the evaporator, the big filter on one side.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just pushed that in, and I heard it click.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And so sometimes you have dumb luck.#Statement-opinion
I, I was, you know,#Uninterpretable
you could have taken something like that and thought, well, the compressor's not working. Or it would have taken me all day probably if I didn't do that. But#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
sometimes you have some dumb luck. If you#Other
That's true.#Appreciation
have a little curiosity and you have enough knowledge to check things out.#Other
I know, I feel bad for people who just, when anything goes wrong, a fuse, you know, they just have to take it.#Statement-non-opinion
And I know#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that's tough if you don't, uh, at least give it a shot.#Other
I've got girls, daughters, and I've always said I'd teach them.#Statement-non-opinion
And my, my one daughter was fairly interested.#Statement-non-opinion
And I really haven't gotten around to,#Statement-non-opinion
I learned because I, I just, uh, learned, you know#Statement-non-opinion
and,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things.#Other
And I'm going to do that.#Statement-non-opinion
I, I told my daughters in college this year, I said, This summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car.#Statement-non-opinion
I said, So you can learn the basics, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
A-,#Uninterpretable
and, and not only from a, from an economic standpoint, just, just pure safety, you know.#Statement-non-opinion
If you can,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to, to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait.#Other
It, it,#Statement-non-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it can, it can save a lot of time and trouble.#Other
I have the,#Uninterpretable
there's one expression I don't like, uh, the country expression, you know, if it ain't, if it ain't broke don't fix it.#Statement-non-opinion

I'm ready if you are.#Statement-non-opinion
Okay.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Um, wh-, where do you stand, uh, on,#Open-Question
Well, I think that people should be allowed to have them.#Statement-opinion
Especially#Statement-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
if they go hunting,#Other
which my son goes hunting.#Statement-non-opinion
He goes deer hunting.#Statement-non-opinion
He goes duck hunting.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, he's read books about guns since he was#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
like probably eleven or twelve years old.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I just think that, uh, as far as that's concerned, he should be able to have them to go hunting with, you know.#Statement-opinion
As far as#Statement-opinion
Right,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
just having handguns around to, to have them, I don't believe that you should have handguns around.#Other
Right.#Agree/Accept
Yeah.#Agree/Accept
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I agree too.#Statement-non-opinion
I, uh,#Uninterpretable
it's, it's, as far as the ban goes and everything, I don't think it's possible, uh, to completely ban guns.#Statement-opinion
There's just too many.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, no.#Agree/Accept
There's too many sports people out there that, that do do these things.#Statement-non-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
and I,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Agree/Accept
right,#Agree/Accept
I mean,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Agree/Accept
that, that's true.#Statement-opinion
And I mean the, the technology's not that hard.#Statement-opinion
I mean, you could make a gun, you know, from simple, you know, you know.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
well I suppose you could. Uh,#Maybe/Accept-part
You know, if, if you really wanted a gun, you, you could make one. Uh,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I think if they want one, they're going to get one.#Statement-opinion
Oh, you know#Uninterpretable
You know.#Uninterpretable
true.#Uninterpretable
That's true.#Agree/Accept
The bad guys are, you know,#Statement-opinion
like I say, if they want a gun they're going to find out#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
somehow to get one.#Other
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
it's,#Uninterpretable
yeah,#Agree/Accept
I mean,#Uninterpretable
yeah#Agree/Accept
there's, there's no way to stop, uh, stop anybody from getting a gun.#Statement-opinion
Uh, I think there should be more control as, like, uh, like maybe waiting periods and things like that, you know, uh,#Statement-opinion
Well I agree with you on that because I know, uh,#Agree/Accept
in fact I had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And for a rifle there's no waiting.#Statement-non-opinion
There wasn't anyhow.#Hedge
Now there might be now.#Hedge
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
there wasn't anything for, you know, rifles and things like that.#Other
I guess#Statement-opinion
Sure.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
it was just handguns that there was a, some kind#Other
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of a waiting, you know, two weeks while they checked you out or something.#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, uh, most of these people that's got these guns that's going around, you know, robbing people and shooting people,#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, I, I know my friend is, uh, really into guns#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, uh, w-, I went a couple of times with him to gun shows, you know, that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
come through town and everything#Other
and, I mean, they just have, I mean they have anything you'd want,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean#Uninterpretable
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know, you know, anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and there's, I mean, there's nothing.#Statement-non-opinion
You can just go buy one and take it home#Statement-non-opinion
and it's easier than getting a, like a video membership card at, you know, a video store.#Statement-opinion
I, see now, I know they were having a gun show about a month ago#Statement-non-opinion
and I was just wondering how that did work, if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh, yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You just go and, uh, buy the gun#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh,#Uninterpretable
There's no restriction though.#Collaborative Completion
You don't have to wait or nothing then huh?#Yes-No-Question
No.#No answers
Well, except for the, the pistols and th-,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not sure how they do that.#Statement-non-opinion
I know they,#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I was just curious, you know, because, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I know at, at the regular gun show, you know, gun shop#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
that you,#Other
.#Non-verbal
that you do have to wait for pistols, like a couple#Other
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
of weeks#Other
and then they check you out,#Statement-non-opinion
then they call you up#Statement-non-opinion
and you h-, go pick it up.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think that's,#Statement-opinion
Which I think they have to do on rifles and things now too.#Statement-opinion
I think there#Statement-opinion
Uh-huh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
.#Non-verbal
is some, something like that.#Other
Anyhow, here, out here in California, I think there is now.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But,#Uninterpretable
I'm not sure,#Statement-non-opinion
I'm not really sure but, what uh, th-, the gun laws in P-, Pennsylvania are like.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Now we don't have guns because#Statement-non-opinion
No.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
we don't go hunting or anything like that.#Other
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But like I say, my son, he's,#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
he's always had a,#Other
like, I think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But he's always, he went to the, to the school to learn how to shoot it.#Statement-non-opinion
He goes to the pistol range#Statement-non-opinion
and th-, and the rifle range to shoot them.#Statement-non-opinion
He likes to go to that, uh, shotgun thing where you shoot at those, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
The skeets, you mean?#Tag-Question
yeah,#Agree/Accept
right#Agree/Accept
He likes to do that#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
you know#Other
But, uh#Hedge
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I don't know.#Other
I think they should try to control it and everything, you know.#Statement-opinion
But as far as just banning it completely, there, that's not going to happen.#Statement-opinion
I don't, yeah, I, I don't think it can happen either.#Agree/Accept
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I just don't, I don't see,#Statement-opinion
and, then, I, I think, uh, hadn't thought about this before#Statement-non-opinion
but if you do that, if they would, uh, uh, decide to ban guns, it would just open up a, a market, you know, a black market for them.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
right,#Agree/Accept
right.#Agree/Accept
And so, you know, they, they would just,#Statement-opinion
all the profits would go to, you know,#Statement-opinion
Now I do believe though, like in California, if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I think they're liable now for,#Other
they#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, th-,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
can be, you know, put in jail and everything. The, whoever owned the gun.#Other
Oh , yeah,#Other
the owner's responsibility?#Summarize/reformulate
You know, now#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
when they have kids around, you'd think that they would be locking them up#Other
or, you know.#Uninterpretable
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
you know, that's, that's true.#Statement-opinion
Uh, you know, I, I had a friend who was a, uh, a policeman in a, in a local borough just a small, uh, one of the little neighborhoods, you know, one of the small towns, uh#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
near Pittsburgh.#Other
And, uh, she said tha-, that, that, uh, you know, he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that#Statement-non-opinion
but, I mean, you know, you're, you know,#Uninterpretable
people make, you know,#Uninterpretable
they forget or, you know, you know,#Statement-non-opinion
kids get in,#Statement-non-opinion
the way kids, the way kids are, you know, I mean, they can, you know.#Statement-opinion
Well they can get into almost anything anymore#Collaborative Completion
Right.#Agree/Accept

Yeah,#Other
they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they've, uh, statewide raises,#Statement-non-opinion
they raise ours it seems like constantly.#Statement-non-opinion
We just, uh, passed a new one, uh,#Statement-non-opinion
fortunately or unfortunately it doesn't go into effect because we did not get the United Airlines.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, right#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Indianapolis got that, didn't they?#Yes-No-Question
Right.#Affirmative non-yes answers
And, uh, we had passed a, a provisional one that if, if it did, if they did locate here we would raise our taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
But, uh, at least we thought we'd get something back from that.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
Uh, how do you feel about taxes?#Open-Question
Well, it seems like a big politics game#Statement-opinion
like up here, last year, the governor was up for re-election#Statement-non-opinion
so he said the budget was fine,#Statement-non-opinion
the state didn't have any money#Statement-non-opinion
and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money#Statement-non-opinion
so they raised all our taxes.#Statement-non-opinion
.#Non-verbal
And now it's election time again#Statement-non-opinion
so they're trying to lower them.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So they're just talk about lowering them#Statement-non-opinion
but they never do,#Statement-non-opinion
they just keep raising them.#Statement-non-opinion
I've never seen taxes really go down.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
me neither.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long#Statement-non-opinion
so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year#Statement-non-opinion
and they're going to lower it for next year.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess they figure they're going to make up for all they didn't get when they should have had a budget.#Statement-opinion
I hope they put that in writing#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
yeah,#Agree/Accept
they say they're going to lower,#Statement-non-opinion
but I'll see.#Statement-non-opinion
I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and, uh, that the rich are not paying their share#Statement-opinion
and of course the poor can't afford it either,#Statement-opinion
but, uh, I really feel like#Uninterpretable
and, and I feel like, you know,#Uninterpretable
I'm a middle class person income wise anyway#Statement-non-opinion
and, uh, I get tired of supporting the whole country.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
so do I.#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I'm a, a middle class barely,#Statement-non-opinion
but, uh, I don't think the rich are paying mo-, less, not enough,#Statement-opinion
I think they're paying too much.#Statement-opinion
You think the rich are paying too much?#Yes-No-Question
Yeah,#Yes answers
I mean if you're in the, the three, three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month, well, that's ridiculous.#Statement-opinion
Why bother working?#Rhetorical-Questions
Well, I don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to,#Statement-non-opinion
I mean, I'm talking about the really rich.#Statement-non-opinion
Well, they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
That would be fair.#Statement-opinion
Now I'll go along with that.#Agree/Accept
Yeah#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
You know,#Other
no loopholes or anything.#Statement-opinion
Everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever.#Statement-opinion
Right.#Agree/Accept
Now, I think that would be fair.#Agree/Accept
Right.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And I, you know,#Uninterpretable
no, no ifs, ands and buts, you know,#Statement-opinion
no big elaborate laws that say, uh, you know, call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review.#Statement-opinion
It's just, you know, you make this, you pay ten percent.#Statement-opinion
If you make a hundred dollars, you pay ten percent,#Statement-opinion
if you make a million dollars, you pay ten percent.#Statement-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
that's the way our state tax is here.#Statement-non-opinion
I think it's pretty fair.#Statement-opinion
Our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal.#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
And, uh, they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
So, and, and you withhold no matter what you do,#Statement-non-opinion
they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough.#Statement-non-opinion
Oh, great,#Appreciation
so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
so now, you know, when you sign your W-Four form or whatever, W-Two#Statement-non-opinion
Uh-huh.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
whatever that is, then they always say, do you want a extra amount for state.#Other
.#Non-verbal
Which is ridiculous,#Other
but it's been that way for the last probably ten years.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
I guess you have to check yes#Statement-opinion
or you come down to the end of the year#Statement-opinion
and you don't have it to give it to them.#Statement-opinion
Right,#Agree/Accept
unless you have a lot of deductions.#Statement-opinion
Yeah.#Acknowledge (Backchannel)
But, you know, if you have a lot of federal deduction, it ends up hurting you state wise.#Statement-opinion
Really?#Backchannel in question form
And you end up owing, you know,#Statement-opinion
you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal#Statement-opinion
and you're going to owe fifteen hundred in state.#Statement-opinion
Ouch#Appreciation
And, uh, it's, it's just ridiculous.#Statement-opinion
But, I, I don't know.#Hedge
I've,#Uninterpretable
they just came up with a twenty-five percent increase on personal property in, in Oklahoma county and that is a chunk.#Statement-non-opinion
Yeah,#Agree/Accept
