"Okay,",,CAT
"well, I can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"and they kind of are in different spectrums, I think. Um,",,INFO
one of them is QUANTUM LEAP,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
and the other one is NIGHT COURT.,,INFO
"And I think, I think they're real different, I mean,",,INFO
"I don't think they have anything in common,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"um, QUANTUM, LEAP has, I mean QUANTUM LEAP is kind of a comedy in its own way, I guess,",,INFO
"but, uh, mostly it's, it's kind of science fiction,",,INFO
"and, it's, um, it's adventure and things like that",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and then NIGHT COURT is just pure, you know, weird fun, you know,",,INFO
"just, it's, it's nothing serious about it at all.",,INFO
"So, I don't know why the two of them happen,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"to be my two favorite shows,",,INFO
"but they, that's the way it is,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"It's funny that those are my two, my husband's two favorite shows, too,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and I enjoy both, watching both of them,",,INFO
but I used to didn't like NIGHT COURT,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I,",,CAT
and the only reason I think I like it now is because I've seen it so much,,INFO
"and I'm involved with the characters,",,INFO
"but,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"I used to think, um, Dan Fielding was just too, too vulgar and too crude for me.",,INFO
He is,,INFO
"And I told my husband, that's the whole point,",,INFO
but,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's right,",,G_G
"I mean,",,CAT
"I, I just,",,CAT
"it's,",,CAT
I find him degrading at times.,,INFO
"I guess that is the point,",,INFO
"but sometimes it just,",,CAT
"Well, they, they really have changed him though.",,INFO
"If, If you've watched it this season, um, he's becoming, I mean, he still is in his own way degrading and everything,",,INFO
"but, uh, he's involved in that charity,",,INFO
"and, uh, it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought, that he really has,",,INFO
"in fact, there was one show that he even turned down a date with some, you know, beautiful woman just because the idea that he was, his mind was on the ozone layer",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"and, you know, global warming and all this other kind of stuff.",,INFO
"And he, you know, was too depressed, you know, to,",,INFO
"so that was part of, I guess, his character building or whatever,",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"I think it adds a, probably adds a little bit of depth to his character.",,INFO
"I haven't watched, um",,INFO
Which of course he needed,,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"I think so,",,INFO
which in QUANTUM LEAP you get,,INFO
"even though the person is involved in so many other people's lives, you still see a, a real person in those situations.",,INFO
"He gets, um, he's doing amazing things",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but he's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"right,",,CAT
"that's a good point,",,G_G
"and I think that's,",,CAT
I like that.,,INFO
"So what do you, what do you consider your favorite shows?",,QUESTION
"Um, I think my favorite show is HUNTER.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"And, I, I like the old ser-, series better when, um",,INFO
"Dede,",,INFO
Dede was in there.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
I agree.,,CAT
"and, um, so, uh, uh, and then the blond that they took out, the one that got killed",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I can't remember what her name is,",,INFO
"but is,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
I didn't enjoy her.,,INFO
"I, I,",,CAT
"she was too much of a opposite of Dede,",,INFO
"and I think that's what they try to do,",,INFO
but I think we wanted to see Dede there,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
or somebody like her.,,INFO
"Well, but, see I read an article about, in T V GUIDE about, uh, about HUNTER, and about his, you know, latest, you know, his three girls, whatever you want to call them",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they say that, uh, that there was abso-, that there was like a conflict between her and him, uh, that they never really could get her into, uh, any character that they could use.",,INFO
"I mean, you know, uh",,CAT
The second lady?,,QUESTION
"yeah,",,CAT
the second one,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
the blond,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you know, if you think about it, they didn't really interact hardly at all",,INFO
They didn't.,,CAT
"I mean, they were never partners.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"she would go her way,",,INFO
and,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"he would do his,",,INFO
and I think that's what I didn't like.,,INFO
"And, and, and even, even at the beginning Dede and, and Hunter would decide that one of them would go do this, while the other one would do, would go this,",,INFO
"but, uh, it seemed like it was almost two different organizations",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"like Hunter was the boss,",,INFO
"and this other girl was not,",,INFO
"and, you know, you kind of, you're wondering, you know, well when did this happen?",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So, yeah,",,CAT
"I, I kind of agree with that.",,INFO
"And I like the new lady better,",,INFO
but I'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there.,,INFO
"I'd just as soon have the, the police story without all the romance.",,INFO
"Well, I'm afraid that's what they, they really wanted to do, um,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think most shows were doing that,",,INFO
and then they went away from it,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and now they're starting to go back to it,",,INFO
"and maybe that's what the public wants,",,INFO
"I don't know,",,CAT
"but I just, I like the, the cut and dry solve the mystery,",,INFO
and that's what I always enjoyed about it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, see, there was that spark between Dede and Hunter for a while",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"but they, they like started it,",,INFO
"and then they'd pull it back,",,INFO
and they'd start it and pull it back.,,INFO
"And that really made it a very interesting, uh, show to where you never really knew which, which one was going to show up. You know, whether it was going to, where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, that, that I kind of thought was good,",,INFO
"but, um, you know, it's, I guess, you know,",,CAT
you always kind of sit there,,INFO
"and you see these two people together,",,INFO
"and you always wonder, why they don't, you know, get together",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
or whatever.,,INFO
And so I guess that's what they decide to do,,INFO
Just go ahead and,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
quit the wondering,,INFO
"and, and,",,CAT
"But it's, it's always been a formula, uh, for T V that the minute that two people, that the two main stars get married, that the show ends up, you know, dying.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"A, a, good example of this, and, you know, this is probabl-,",,INFO
maybe it's not a good example.,,CAT
"I've been watching Nickelodeon all last week, because they had what they called MAXIMUM SMART.",,INFO
"They had GET SMART for, uh, ten hours a day, from seven o'clock at night, until six or until five o'clock the next morning.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
All the GET SMART episodes you could ever see.,,INFO
"Well, the, the last day, all they did was the last season, to where the two of them got married",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and that was, I mean, that was the killer,",,INFO
"the series died right after that,",,INFO
"I didn't,",,INFO
"because,",,INFO
well go ahead.,,COMMAND
"I was going to say, I didn't ever watch MOONLIGHTING,",,INFO
but I heard that's what killed it,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
same thing.,,INFO
"that, uh, interplay died when they got married,",,INFO
and so the show died.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"the,",,CAT
"it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they, they, before they get married",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"the minute they get married, everything's supposed to be cut and dried",,INFO
and,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and, well, of course, another one of their mistakes, I think, is they have a tendency to change characters, or to change the characters', uh, uh, personalities",,INFO
"Halfway through,",,INFO
"well, especially after they get married.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Um, couple of examples would be, um, well, like I said, this one about Max S-, or Get Well Smart, the female character, Barbara Feldon",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"she had been at the beginning the, the intelligent one, the, the one who always solved the things and, and figured out and kept Max from getting real messed up.",,INFO
"Well, in short, whenever they got married, she got dingy.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"You know, why would they do that?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
It made no sense.,,INFO
"I, I'm guess it's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows",,INFO
"Unfortunately, that's probably true.",,G_G
"yeah,",,CAT
"which kind of,",,CAT
"like in the big soap opera shows, which I don't enjoy because of that,",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Well, do you you watch, um, what is that show, WHO'S THE BOSS?",,QUESTION
"That's, uh, that's on Tuesday nights I think.",,INFO
"I've seen it before,",,INFO
but I don't watch it regularly.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, I",,INFO
"Usually Tuesday nights I'm out,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"I hardly ever watch it,",,INFO
"but, as, as I've seen it, they've, they've done sort of the same thing to where they've, they started to let them get together,",,INFO
and then they pulled them apart,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I think they're thinking about that exact thing, about the idea that if the show lets them, uh, get together, then you lose part of what the show's all about.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So. I always thought that was kind of weird.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it's funny how we, uh, we, we romanticize people",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"like, for instance, where as the teenager, you know, you romance a, romanticize a rock star,",,INFO
"but when he gets married, then you don't care any more",,INFO
"Um, right.",,CAT
"or something like that,",,INFO
and I think it's the same with your characters on T V.,,INFO
"Do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret, or at least they keep it quiet.",,QUESTION
"Probably,",,CAT
yeah,,CAT
"I mean,",,CAT
I know it affected me when I was younger.,,INFO
I'm not into rock stars,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"too much lately,",,INFO
but,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
like Madonna and Sean Penn.,,INFO
Now I don't particularly like either one of them,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but, um, uh, their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"or at least, that's the way I look at it.",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"So I don't know,",,CAT
"it would have been hard,",,INFO
wouldn't it.,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
I would think so.,,INFO
"I just, the, the publicity in and of itself, much less the, I mean,",,INFO
"when you get married you've got relationship to develop in the first place,",,INFO
"so, having twenty million people watch you do that",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it's,",,CAT
they wouldn't be easy.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, um, well that's kind of interesting.",,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, um, well I guess that's about all we need to do, isn't it.",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think we've covered our time.,,INFO
.,,CAT
It's been good talking to you.,,G_G
"Yeah,",,G_G
"it has been, Becky,",,G_G
I really appreciate it.,,G_G
"You're the first man I've talked to,",,INFO
"everyone else has been a female,",,INFO
so this is a change.,,INFO
"Well, I think I've, um,",,CAT
you're the second female I've talked to.,,INFO
"You've had a little bit of variety, huh.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
it's kind of nice,,INFO
Okay,,CAT
"well, thanks so much.",,G_G
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Bye-bye.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
"Well, my family moved to Texas about eight years ago.",,INFO
"My husband was raised here, by",,INFO
"I, I have never lived here,",,INFO
"so, um, when we came back to Texas, I was really kind of excited.",,INFO
There wasn't a state income tax,,INFO
"and there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at the, the grocery store and things.",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"And all of that was new to me,",,INFO
because I'm sort of feeling like we're getting a better deal here than what I was accustomed to.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Did you move from the Northeast?,,QUESTION
"Well, I lived in Missouri and then in Utah",,CAT
"and them, um, both places had pretty good state income tax.",,INFO
"And, um, we've always paid tax, you know, on everything we purchased, even food at the grocery store.",,INFO
"So, I thought it was really, you know, kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries",,INFO
"and, but, I think, I mean, I don't enjoy paying taxes.",,INFO
"And it's hard,",,INFO
"but, um, I think that is what we have to have, you know, have our streets and have, have our government and Excuse me. And have, and have the services that we need",,INFO
"and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and, and things like that",,INFO
"and I think, I guess, what I feel is that most people, um, they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like there's some people that aren't paying their fair share.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"And, um, that makes you feel bad.",,INFO
People that can really influence the government have all the money to throw.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And you know, when, um, when last year the elections were going, on the governors election and state and, you know.",,INFO
"I, I didn't have anything against Clayton Williams personally or anything,",,INFO
"but, um, it was kind of hard for me to think, here's someone as wealthy as he is,",,INFO
didn't have to pay any income tax.,,INFO
"That he said that year,",,CAT
"he claimed, he had, he didn't have to pay income tax",,INFO
"and he thought, you know,",,CAT
"there's some people are living pretty, pretty good life styles,",,INFO
but they're not paying income tax.,,INFO
"And that's not fair,",,INFO
No.,,CAT
to me.,,INFO
"And there's, you know, some people, you know, who are abusing the systems that we pay taxes to support",,INFO
and all that makes us feel bad.,,INFO
"But I think, all in all, how I feel, is that, um, I'm willing to pay the taxes because I think I like our country compared to the other countries I've studied and visited.",,INFO
And I'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services that I enjoy.,,INFO
How do you feel?,,QUESTION
"Well, yeah.",,CAT
I agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get,,CAT
"and,",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"and I think that, you know, I don't think that there's any really, any system that everybody would think is fair, as far as, being taxed.",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"So, I guess, in Texas with,",,CAT
"we live here also,",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"and that it's mostly sales tax,",,INFO
"so it's, really the people that have money to buy things are paying the more because they're paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff.",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
I've lived in Texas most of my life.,,INFO
"We, um, lived in Kansas City for a couple of years,",,INFO
and we were kind of in for a rude awakening.,,INFO
They had personal property taxes on like cars,,INFO
"and, the first year we were there it was kind of like, eight hundred dollars,",,INFO
"Oh, no.",,G_G
And we're like .,,INFO
My husband says I used to complain to pay sixty dollars to get licensed in Texas,,INFO
"and now,",,CAT
.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"So, I mean, that was kind of different",,INFO
"and then to file a, a state income tax, was also kind of tough, too.",,INFO
"I guess, since we've been married, we've moved a lot,",,INFO
"so it always seems like, you know, we're always paying taxes for something.",,INFO
.,,CAT
And it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little money back.,,INFO
"But,",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"I, um, have a accounting background,",,INFO
"so I then, have also done tax returns in the past for other people when I worked for an accounting firm.",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"And, uh, you know, it is kind of sad to see how the people that have the resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put there money in places, they don't have to pay taxes.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Or to buy something that loses money so that they can offset the income that they get or whatever.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, you know, I think, if, I can understand why the rich people don't want to pay,",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"you know, a large, large percent",,INFO
"because, you know, that's not really fair, either.",,INFO
"If they've earned money by themselves, well, you know, people just kind of given the money,",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"it's kind of depressing sometimes, I think.",,INFO
"Well, it is,",,CAT
"and sometimes, I think, um, well, for myself, that income that we have, we pay a certain salary,",,INFO
"but, I think the employer keeps in mind this will be deducted, you know,",,INFO
"so, so many taxes will be deducted from it",,INFO
"and so, I think, you know, our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And so, I think, you know, in that way, we're compensated, um, just by our society. Um,",,INFO
"yet, you know, they don't pay you, um, what, just what it would take,",,INFO
"and if you pay taxes on it, you wouldn't have any money left over.",,INFO
"And, and, um, but some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything I wish that they would, I guess, because I'm not one of them",,INFO
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
that's true,,CAT
"I wish that they would, you know, realize that they, they couldn't make this kind of money,",,INFO
they couldn't live that kind of life style anywhere else.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"In that,",,CAT
"even if they made that kind of money, there's some countries that have like, fifty percent income tax, you know, that have,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"socialized medicines and things that,",,INFO
"they, um, they wouldn't be able to enjoy the in that.",,INFO
"So that, you know, they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
they've earned it.,,INFO
"And yes,",,CAT
"they have such great fortune here,",,INFO
"but they need to pay for it, too, because they couldn't do it somewhere else.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Um, I like Texas, um, not having the state income tax",,INFO
and I hope that,,CAT
"because, um, we've had enough industry here, that, I guess it,",,INFO
is that why we don't have,,QUESTION
"industry here is able to, to fund the state because we have oil here and things,",,QUESTION
"I mean, that's what I've always heard.",,INFO
"Is that, um,",,CAT
"They must have enough other stuff because the way the oil has been the last few years, that, that really has not been,",,CAT
Big boom.,,INFO
"the industry that is bringing in the money for the taxes, I wouldn't think.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"There's something about, um, the industry in the state,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"That, um,",,INFO
there's enough.,,INFO
"I know, we moved here from Houston",,INFO
and the city had enough money.,,INFO
"It was really nice that they had, um, that",,INFO
"they began to cut back because of the oil problems,",,INFO
"but, um, they would have, um, so many community outdoor theaters and,",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"And like, uh, community country club type things.",,INFO
"That the,",,CAT
it was such nice services to offer the residents in the city,,INFO
and I really liked that.,,INFO
"Don't you have to,",,CAT
"why people decided to expect certain services,",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"Then, they don't really think they should pay for them, maybe.",,INFO
I don't know.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
That's true.,,CAT
"And I, you know, like",,CAT
the property tax that we pay is so much higher than my parents pay in Missouri.,,INFO
"But, um, I'm, I'm comfortable at least in this year, with, with,",,INFO
we have some good schools.,,INFO
The school thing might be changing,,INFO
"but,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I'm willing to pay for that for my children.,,INFO
"And I'm willing to sacrifice, I guess.",,INFO
"I'm not going to be the type of person that's going to grumble about the taxes, even though we're paying a pretty high percentage.",,INFO
I feel like you get what you pay for,,INFO
and I want to be here,,INFO
"and I enjoy, I enjoy living here in this country",,INFO
"and having seen other countries, I'd much rather live here and pay taxes,",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
than live somewhere else and not,,INFO
"Anyway, well, I guess, I better let you go.",,G_G
"Well, it was nice talking to you.",,G_G
"Yeah,",,G_G
it was nice.,,G_G
"I haven't ever, I need, I've never initiated one of these phone calls.",,G_G
Do you call in,,G_G
do you get to pick the subject,,G_G
"or,",,G_G
No.,,G_G
No.,,G_G
They just define it to you,,G_G
"and so,",,G_G
Oh.,,G_G
I see.,,G_G
"you get what, uh, get luck of the draw",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
Yeah,,G_G
"Yeah,",,G_G
"anyway, well, good luck to you.",,G_G
"Okay,",,G_G
"you, too.",,G_G
Bye.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
Your turn.,,INFO
"Oh, I, I start.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"Well, uh, we keep a budget to an extent.",,INFO
"Uh, and really, i-, i-, we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm, I'm paid once a month which sort of, sort of forces some, uh, uh, restrictions",,INFO
and you need to make sure all your bills are paid.,,INFO
"Uh, about yourself?",,QUESTION
"Well, I have to say I really don't have a budget.",,INFO
"Both my wife and I, uh, grew up in, uh, families of rather modest means",,INFO
"and, uh, our family income, at this point, is comfortable. Upper middle class I guess you might say.",,INFO
"And, uh, we're both so, uh, frugal that, uh, we really don't need a budget, you know.",,INFO
We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well I guess that really is sort of, uh, keeping a budget,",,INFO
"you know. You stay within your, uh",,INFO
Well we stay within our means,,CAT
but we,,INFO
within your means.,,INFO
"don't do it, uh, by conscious effort.",,INFO
It just sort of happens automatically.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Although we just moved to California,,INFO
"and, uh, the cost of living here in California is, uh, I would say rather pathological",,INFO
Yes,,CAT
"Uh, housing prices are, you know, like from four to ten times more expensive than, uh, uh, they were where I came from in, uh, Dallas.",,INFO
"Oh, you moved from Dallas to San Francisco.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, uh",,INFO
That is a hugh difference.,,INFO
"uh, that presents a, a real shock",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Ac-, ac-, actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
But you have good sour dough,,INFO
and it's a beautiful place to live,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It's God's country.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, and one way you know that is that only God can afford it",,INFO
* Labelled as an indep slash unit since A's next turn is so voluminous before B.24,,CAT
"Uh, so budget is not a problem for us.",,INFO
"Uh, at least it hasn't been.",,INFO
"It may, may be at this point.",,INFO
"But, uh, up until this point it really hasn't been",,INFO
"When I, uh, was in, uh, undergraduate school a long, long time ago, I, uh, noted that the monthly salary, starting average monthly salary salary for engineers that, you know, in my discipline, was like oh, six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that.",,INFO
Uh-huh. * See B.22 note,,CAT
"And, uh, I noted at that point that I was, you know, if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever.",,INFO
So I stopped worrying about money.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And it,",,CAT
never have worried about money since then.,,INFO
"Well, that, that's a system too.",,INFO
"Sometimes, uh, it's a bit of a, a problem, you know, because I guess I don't really manage my money the way I should.",,INFO
"But, uh, I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of, of, uh, investments",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Well then again, you know, you said you, you are able to take trips.",,INFO
"And you do, obviously, have enough to live on",,INFO
so I guess you're indirectly budgeting.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, just bye-bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal, uh, in spending the money.",,INFO
"So, I mean that's, that's a form of budgeting I would think",,INFO
"It's, it's kind of a strange topic to, to try to, for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money.",,INFO
"Well, I guess we're both lucky in that regard then.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
How big is your family?,,QUESTION
"Uh, well we're, we have one on the way.",,INFO
I see.,,CAT
"Uh, my wife,",,INFO
"and then, we're, we're having one on the way in, uh, in, uh, September.",,INFO
"So how,",,CAT
"you, whe-, once you get ten children though, you may have,",,INFO
No,,CAT
I think it's just going to be one.,,INFO
"Oh, all right",,CAT
How about yourself?,,QUESTION
I have two kids.,,INFO
"Uh, one",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
nine and one thirteen,,INFO
"and they are beginning to be a budget problem but, uh, have not been really up until this, up to this point.",,INFO
Do they budget at all?,,QUESTION
I mean do you have them on an allowance?,,QUESTION
"I give them a, I give them an allowance",,INFO
"and they, uh,",,CAT
I basically give my son ten dollars a week,,INFO
and I put half of it in the bank,,INFO
"and I give, give him the other half in cold cash.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, he has a teller card so he can, uh, do what he wi-, do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank.",,INFO
"But, at least, it isn't, you know, burning a hole in his pocket.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"If he wants to use it, he has to go get it",,INFO
and that usually,,CAT
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
did they tell you our topic?,,QUESTION
"Uh, no,",,CAT
somebody else answered the phone and put my number in.,,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
"it's, uh,",,CAT
"Uh, what is the topic?",,QUESTION
The topic is cars.,,INFO
What kind of car will you buy next,,INFO
"and what kind of decision you'd, do you think about getting, you know, pick that car out and, uh, and why.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"Uh, my next car to buy probably would be a Cadillac.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"I've had, uh,",,INFO
"well, I'm on my third one.",,INFO
And I'm not real sure that I'd be in the market for a car for quite a while.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I'm the same way.,,INFO
"I was, uh, I had two Cadillacs.",,INFO
I went to my first Lincoln this last time.,,INFO
I travel,,INFO
"and, uh, my grandfather worked for Ford Motor Company",,INFO
"so he always said why don't you drive a Ford, or why don't you try a Lincoln",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
so I finally tried one,,INFO
"My,",,CAT
after fifty years,,INFO
"and, uh, I've had, I guess, I guess four Cadillacs and, and one Suburban in my last five cars,",,INFO
but I bought a Lincoln,,INFO
and I like it.,,INFO
"My dad has been a, a, uh, Lincoln man for a lot of years,",,INFO
but I've always been a G M man.,,INFO
I'm in the auto parts business myself.,,INFO
"Oh, are you?",,QUESTION
"And, uh, the last Cadillac I bought was an Allante.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I just love it to death.,,INFO
I'm not sure I'd ever get rid of it.,,INFO
"Well, I'm a, I'm a traveling salesman.",,INFO
I travel on the road,,INFO
so I like a little heavier car,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
I used to do that quite a bit myself.,,INFO
"So that's why I choose, you know, to drive a heavier car",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and more luxury car.,,INFO
"But, I tell you what,",,CAT
I will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly.,,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
because I like the Lincoln,,INFO
"but, there's just something about that Cadillac that, whether it's a G M C product or whatever.",,INFO
"They seem to put,",,INFO
Seems they handle better.,,INFO
They seem to be put together a little bit better.,,INFO
"I think so, too.",,CAT
"And, you know, the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products",,INFO
"and I think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from, uh, imports is they put so much, you know, gadgetry on the dash",,INFO
"and, and the, the buttons are so small",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
they really do.,,INFO
to push,,INFO
and G M doesn't seem to do that.,,INFO
"I kind of like that feature,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"You know, I'm a funny duck",,CAT
"that came, it comes to the simple things like front end alignments",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac.,,INFO
"I don't know why, why",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"whether I just seem to drive them better or what,",,INFO
"but, I've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac.",,INFO
They always appear to hold well.,,INFO
"I've, uh, I had an Eldorado, was my first one, was an eighty",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, I think at about sixty thousand miles I finally had it lined up.",,INFO
Did you.,,QUESTION
And I had them do all four wheels.,,INFO
"And the only thing I miss about a Cadillac is,",,INFO
a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car,,INFO
"and I traded it in, traded it in on my Lincoln",,INFO
and they're just not as large as before.,,INFO
I do miss that.,,INFO
"That's true,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"But, what is big today.",,QUESTION
"Well, you're right.",,CAT
You know. Lincoln is still as big as it always has been,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it's big,",,INFO
"but the trunk space for me, uh,",,INFO
what I usually do is I usually take the back seat out of my car,,INFO
and that's where I put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough.,,INFO
You know a car I ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"now, I have the Town Car",,INFO
"and it's, it's a deep trunk, but not as broad as the, uh, the Cadillac.",,INFO
"Well, the Town Car, I noticed, uh,",,INFO
"or with the, with the Continental, uh, I was, rented one, one time",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, we could, uh, put golf clubs in them.",,INFO
"Oh, good.",,G_G
"You know, straight across.",,INFO
"I mean,",,CAT
They went all the way down?,,QUESTION
Front to back.,,CAT
"Well, that's good.",,G_G
Not going from side to side.,,INFO
That's good.,,G_G
And we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I sell sporting goods, uh, hunting related items,",,INFO
"I sell guns, gun cases",,INFO
I see.,,G_G
and things like that,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and I need to, you know,",,INFO
that's about the same size as a golf club.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"They need to, samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
I don't know if you've ever looked at a Continental.,,QUESTION
Nope.,,CAT
"Uh, it's not as peppy as a, as a Town Car",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"because it's a V Six,",,INFO
"but it, uh,",,CAT
"I too-, I drove it from here to Memphis",,INFO
and I really enjoyed driving that car.,,INFO
"If I was going to buy a Ford product, that's what I would buy.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I drove mine a couple weeks ago to our, one of our big national sales meetings in Nashville.",,INFO
I usually fly.,,INFO
I drove it with another one of my guy that worked for me.,,INFO
"We drove it ten hours to Nashville,",,INFO
"and it, it handled real well,",,INFO
"but, my main thing is space,",,INFO
"so if a Continental,",,INFO
"I might consider it the next time,",,INFO
a Continental has,,INFO
You might take a look at them.,,COMMAND
more trunk space.,,INFO
"They, they had a, a lot more trunk space.",,INFO
"As a matter of fact, they had more trunk space than my, uh, Sedan De Ville had.",,INFO
You always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs?,,QUESTION
"Uh, all three of mine have had leather interiors,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
I like leather interiors also.,,INFO
"Uh, I had a eighty Eldorado, which was leather",,INFO
"and, uh, then my eighty-six was a touring sedan.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, it had the gray leather package in it",,INFO
"and my Allante has, uh",,INFO
That's a nice car.,,INFO
"I guess saddle, saddle colored type thing.",,INFO
"You bet,",,G_G
"and I'll, I will say one thing about Cadillacs versus,",,INFO
,,
"Um, tell me some about your camping experiences, Carolyn.",,COMMAND
"Well, um, I have gone to girl's camp a few times, as a, you know, a chaperon or a leader, whatever",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"and, uh, I enjoy camping.",,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"we ha-, we have a tent,",,INFO
"and we've gone, even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove, um,",,INFO
"I guess our, our, my biggest memory is when we froze to death",,INFO
.,,CAT
We just didn't take enough blankets and,,INFO
"Wh-,",,QUESTION
whatever.,,INFO
where do you go camping at around here?,,INFO
"Uh, we went camping at, uh, Lake Bonham, which is, is pretty close here. Um,",,INFO
"we went fairly early in the season for this area, which is probably April",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"is when we went,",,INFO
"and, and it got really cold at night,",,INFO
and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things,,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"in the morning,",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Uh, what, uh, what activities do you do when you're camping?",,QUESTION
"Oh, we take little nature hikes",,INFO
"and, and, uh, we take along games that we can play with the, with the kids, and just that kind of stuff.",,INFO
"Usually try to have a, uh, occasionally a camp fire at night, you know, and",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
roast the marshmallows and what all.,,INFO
"Well, that sounds like fun.",,INFO
"I, uh, I grew up in South Dakota, up in the Black Hills",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"and so we used to go camping,",,INFO
"my dad would take us,",,INFO
"there was, there was four of us kids,",,INFO
"we'd, he'd take us,",,INFO
"and we'd all go camping, my dad and my mom and, and the kids,",,INFO
"and it was always fun, uh,",,INFO
"because what I always remember is, my dad would let us pick our camp spot",,INFO
"and, uh, he'd always tell us, you know, okay, look for, you know, a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents,",,INFO
"and it always had to be somewhere near a, a river so we could go fishing,",,INFO
"and hopefully we'd catch our supper,",,INFO
but we never did,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"but it was, it was always fun.",,INFO
"We'd always,",,INFO
Mom was always prepared,,INFO
"and she'd bring along, you know, something, because tradition had it we would never catch anything,",,INFO
"so we always had,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"something along to eat,",,INFO
"but then we'd roast, roast marshmallows,",,INFO
"and it, it was always an enjoyable experience.",,INFO
"Uh, about nineteen eighty-two I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills,",,INFO
"I crossed the state to, to Aberdeen,",,INFO
"and, uh, there's no hills,",,INFO
"it's flat,",,INFO
"and then I was in high school,",,INFO
"and, uh, couple of friends, couple of my high school friends and I, we'd go camping out by a river, of course, and, and go fishing,",,INFO
"but by then, of course, I was able to catch, uh, catch some things,",,INFO
"but, it, it was always fun.",,INFO
It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, in the hills we, we would do like you di-, you folks did, you folks did, would take the nature hikes and, you know, and look for animals,",,INFO
"and we always, you know,",,INFO

"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah,,CAT
"Well, that sounds,",,CAT

"and, but she's a good paper pusher.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And it's in a technical position really.,,INFO
And you know she should be more technical for what she does.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT

And that's where the high pay is.,,INFO

I don't know why.,,INFO

either.,,INFO

it's not something that I tend to hear about.,,INFO

"Oh, that's interesting,",,G_G
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I mean, I, I suppose that, that it's difficult to really say why because, uh, you know, there, there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified.",,INFO

Maybe they don't apply for the job.,,INFO
I don't know.,,INFO

Right.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"Which could be, you know, part-, partially cultural anyway.",,INFO
That could be.,,CAT
That's true.,,CAT
"So that it might be circularly being the same problem of, of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway,",,INFO

"somebody to stay home that,",,INFO
I don't think there was a valid reason,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT

"but I believe in taking an active part in politics,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I,",,CAT
"one, one thing that really bothers me beyond, beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes",,INFO
"and the, um, regular normal taxpayers are, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"paying such a large proportion of, of our personal income",,INFO
"and then the, uh, corporate, you know, industries just don't seem to not pay proportionally.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"I think that that would, would help a lot.",,INFO
"I guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things,",,INFO
"but I don't know. It's just hard to, hard to take and, you know, see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from, from that direction.",,INFO
"But,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"they don't, they don't seem to, well,",,INFO
I really think the biggest problem,,INFO
and then the Taft-Rudman Act is supposed to help that.,,INFO
The biggest part is they have no accountability for what they're doing.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean this nonsense that's coming through now about, uh, uh, lowering payments on Social Security and a few other things that Bush has in mind in order t-, to boost the economy because people have n-, more money as it's, gets, it's ridiculous.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"If they don't have that money now, bringing in less is not going to help the problem",,INFO
"Not, not going to help.",,CAT
as far as the government.,,INFO
"It's nev-, never helped my, my personal situation",,INFO
I,,INFO
No.,,CAT
I can't say it would help with theirs either,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and thank God we don't operate our budget,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"the way they operate theirs or we'd all be in, in dire trouble.",,INFO
Amen .,,G_G
"But that's, uh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
I don't know what we're going to be able to do about it,,INFO
but I guess it's sitting around so long that it's sort of like our mortgages.,,INFO
I don't ever expect to pay mine off before I die,,INFO
so I guess why should the government,,INFO
.,,CAT
"Isn't,",,CAT
that's the way they're thinking these days anyway.,,INFO
"It seems, seems to be.",,CAT
"I, you know, I,",,CAT
"it really does bother me when I think about, you know, leaving our children with, with this sort of, uh, a national problem that we can't seem to find an, an answer to it, uh,",,INFO
I don't know.,,CAT
"I, I don't think it ever will really.",,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"maybe if they ever get to the point the biggest, you know, the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Really.,,CAT
"If they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic, you know, inter-, intergovernmental or inter United States like programs that one really might.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I believe in paying my share,",,INFO
"and I don't mind, uh, paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to.",,INFO
"But I just, I just sometimes feel like I'm being used.",,INFO
"But, uh, again I don't think we'll be able to do anything about it,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Well, that's, that's quite possible.",,INFO
"I guess we have to, have to keep plugging away a little bit",,INFO
or it will just totally get even more out of control,,INFO
"but I, I don't know.",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Bite the bullet.,,INFO
It sounds like you have a baby there.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I do.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"She's a,",,INFO
we're not feeling too well over here,,INFO
"so that,",,CAT
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, that's a shame.",,CAT
"She's not the one going to Washington, huh?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
no.,,CAT
"She's,",,CAT
Oh,,CAT
I don't think I could part with her.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"Okay, Geri.",,CAT
We've probably been on long enough.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"They didn't cut us off,",,INFO
but I think that will probably do it,,INFO
so it was nice talking to you.,,G_G
"Okay,",,G_G
"well, thanks.",,G_G
Okey-doke.,,G_G
Bye-bye,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"Well, I take it since you selected this topic that you have children.",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"I don't,",,INFO
You don't?,,QUESTION
but I have nine younger brothers and sisters.,,INFO
My goodness.,,G_G
.,,CAT
"So. Well, I have two daughters",,INFO
"and, um, they're past this, they've been latchkey children for a while,",,INFO
"and they're almost where I can start saying they're, you know, young adults,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
so I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore.,,INFO
"Um, we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask,",,COMMAND
Uh-huh.,,CAT
or expect.,,INFO
"I would assume it's, you know, if you were looking for a day-care center or something like that.",,CAT
"Well, if I were look-,",,CAT
Or probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing.,,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
Exactly.,,CAT
"Um, I think my, my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
I would think someone older,,INFO
and I would want to know if they've had any past experience with children.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I think that varies.,,INFO
I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
that's true also.,,CAT
"Um, you know, it's, it's, once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's, you know, really, really qualified",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
per se.,,INFO
"Um, with a, with a baby, definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"Well, um, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was younger.",,INFO
I'm twenty-two now,,INFO
and I did most of my baby-sitting when I was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen.,,INFO
"But, um, the only thing people ever asked me,",,INFO
"well, of course, they knew I came from a family with younger kids,",,INFO
but they really didn't ask me if I was used to children or not.,,INFO
The only other thing they asked me is what I would expect in pay.,,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, and, um, I was pretty surprised because if I had a child and someone, you know, I would want to know, I personally would ask for people that that person has baby-sit for before.",,INFO
"Well, I, my experience, I baby-sat a lot also at, when I grew up",,INFO
"and, um, coming from, you know, that background and the background as a parent now, I think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a, a lot of times baby-sitters,",,INFO
"I know I did this with my children,",,INFO
"it's, you get somebody where you kind of know the family already.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Becaus-, because I had three younger brothers and sisters myself",,INFO
"so they, they thought, okay,",,INFO
"she knows how to, how to treat children.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"Well, see when, um, I first got my mai-, my first baby-sitting job was pretty strange.",,INFO
"Um, this lady saw us at church",,INFO
"and she was a you-, you know, she was a younger lady.",,INFO
She didn't really know my mom.,,INFO
She knew my mom by name,,INFO
and that was it.,,INFO
"And, um, she knew that I was one of the oldest girls in my family",,INFO
so she just asked my mom if I could baby-sit.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, she really didn't know my name or anything, you know,",,INFO
I thought that was pretty strange.,,INFO
"You know, and she had two children.",,INFO
One was still in diapers when I started baby-sitting.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"So, um, she pretty much, you know, just assumed that I would know, you know, how to handle them.",,INFO
"So, I wa-, you know, I enjoy kids",,INFO
and I get along with them very well,,INFO
so there's no problem.,,INFO
"But, uh, with today's world and the kids today, uh, there's no way, I can't say that I would just ask someone, you know, that I didn't know like that to baby-sit.",,INFO
"Oh, I agree with you,",,CAT
"but there again she, you know, she knew, knew of your family,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"and she, and she met in a safe setting, such as church.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So she was going on those two instincts.,,INFO
"Just the same I know myself,",,INFO
"I never,",,CAT
and I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children.,,INFO
"Oh, I would be too",,INFO
"And, and in i-, it really shocked me",,INFO
"because just about six months ago someone came to my front door, rang the doorbell.",,INFO
She had just moved in the neighborhood.,,INFO
"She had her daughter with her,",,INFO
"and the daughter was, oh, about a second grader.",,INFO
And she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit her child.,,INFO
"Oh, my.",,G_G
"And I thought, well she doesn't know me or my children from anything.",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"And it was, I was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because I didn't know her",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, I mean people are so different.",,INFO
"Oh, I know.",,CAT
"Um, well, I real-, I, obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything.",,QUESTION
"Well, I did, I did have, um, my, my child, uh, in a day care for just a short time a-, when my oldest was about two and a half",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I worked just a part-time job,,INFO
"and, uh, in, in those situations, um, what I did is I'd, I went in",,INFO
"and, you know, I made a few phone calls,",,INFO
I went in and visited.,,INFO
I asked questions such as how they would discipline a child.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, that was a concern with me.",,INFO
"Um, you know, c-, you, you learn a lot by going in there",,INFO
"and they e-, they explain to you, you know, what their day consists of and what their general rules are,",,INFO
"and, um, that's, you know, that's as much as I know.",,INFO
You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, that have done this over and over again.",,INFO
"Well,",,CAT
"But I,",,CAT
go ahead.,,COMMAND
How did you stumble upon the day-care center?,,QUESTION
Did you just look it up in a phone book,,QUESTION
or what was it?,,QUESTION
"Um, I think lots of people, I, I think I went by location for one thing.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I think most people do that.,,INFO
"I think you start out with the criteria of, you know, do I know of anything",,INFO
or do I know anyone who has their child in a day care,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"there is , I would say most people would probably go by word of mouth.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"And then, you know, I mean, even at that you have to consider the logistics of it.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, I mean, you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
"Yo-, even if that's the best one in the whole wide world",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So there, there are just so many considerations.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Then again, did, um, money come into play with it at all?",,QUESTION
"Oh, money is always a factor in my life,",,CAT
.,,CAT
definitely.,,INFO
"I've never, you know, I've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor. Um, even in something as important as day care.",,INFO
"I know if I didn't have that stipulation, I would have done things differently",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
you know.,,INFO
"Um, Montessori school would be something that I would have pursued,",,INFO
but that's always a little bit more expensive than what I could look at.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, and I was very very fortunate in that I didn't have to do that on a full-time basis.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"So, and, and then when you get, you know, when you get into the full-time basis day care,",,CAT
,,
"So, uh, tell me about changes from say twenty years ago, since you were an adult, twenty years ago.",,COMMAND
"Well, let's see, well, we assume I was an adult twenty years ago, Um,",,INFO
"Well, you're, you're able to, you're able to, uh, vote and go to war and things like that",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,INFO
definitely able to go to war twenty years ago but not vote.,,INFO
"Oh, that's right,",,INFO
that's one of the changes,,INFO
Not vote.,,INFO
That was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years.,,INFO
"Um, yeah,",,CAT
"twenty years ago is nineteen seventy,",,INFO
"uh, nineteen seventy I had been married two years.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty-eight,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, around here on the, uh, east coast, uh,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
we were heavy into affirmative action.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"And, uh, that was a, uh, a great shock for a lot of people.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, a great disappointment for some people like myself.",,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, I was gainfully employed by Safeway Stores Incorporated.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, trying desperately to, uh, get ahead with the company.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, the problem was that my hair was too long.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, you weren't allowed to have a, uh, mustache or a beard,",,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, jeans just flat out weren't allowed,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"unless you worked on night stock,",,CAT
"and,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"if you wanted to get ahead with the company,",,INFO
"well if you were a, uh, black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months,",,INFO
if you were white male you're talking six years.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
And that's basically where I ended up.,,INFO
"I, uh, I just flat out couldn't get hold, you know, get ahead with the company because they were dead in affirmative action.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, on other fronts, um,",,CAT
"And is the company now, uh, well represented, uh, demographically, at the higher echelons?",,QUESTION
"Um,",,CAT
Did it work?,,QUESTION
"I think so,",,CAT
"I, I, I, I stopped working for them in, uh, seventy-eight, seventy-nine.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, it's,",,CAT
"I think they're, they're like all companies, well represented.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, you know, everything seems to be fine.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I, I've kind of lost touch with the company,",,INFO
"we had a falling out,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"but, uh, as far as, uh, as their management goes, um, I'm not sure they're any, any better off than they were, were before management wise.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, uh, other changes, um, just people seem to be more outspoken now individually, rather than collectively.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, back in the seventies we had, uh, a lot of, uh, protests against the war, and, uh, bring our troops home",,INFO
"and things were, more organized.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, I've noticed, that now, more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um,",,CAT
"So there's less, you think now there's less of a, a social movement and more individual mov-, lots of individual movements.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
In a sense.,,CAT
"I'm not sure if that was because, you know, eighties was like the, uh, the me decade.",,INFO
The me decade.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, everybody was into me,",,INFO
and then we are getting back into us.,,INFO
"But, um, it, it, it's",,CAT
"I've seen, uh, uh, a great deal of change as far as, um, corporate responsibility and things, um,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, people's response to that, you know, at first not trusting and now, expecting more.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"And what ab-, what about the last ten years that you've been aware.",,QUESTION
"Well, that I've been aware of, I've,",,INFO
"at least in my own circles I've been aware of an increasing from my generation,",,INFO
"I don't know if I can quite call myself a distinct generation from you,",,INFO
"but half generation off, I guess.",,INFO
"Um, I've noticed, uh, a certain increase, um, pessimism with America no longer being sort of on top.",,INFO
"I had the impression,",,INFO
"well, I mean, there was the quote, unquote losing of the Vietnam war, which was a blow,",,INFO
"and it was right around that time when I started becoming socially, you know, a socially conscious adult.",,INFO
"And, I realize that people of my age have no, um, no major success in the sense that, uh, you saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and, um, major social change in that sense,",,INFO
"and I,",,CAT
"and all the changes that have happened in the last, uh, even during my adulthood, have been more incremental.",,INFO
"They've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made,",,INFO
"but there hasn't been the same sort of fiery speeches of Martin Luther King or whatever, that has really, uh, galvanized the population.",,INFO
"And there's just,",,CAT
"instead there's been sort of an increasing, oh, I don't know, Japan bashing and things like that.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, a lot of,",,CAT
"I see among some of my friends and even more among some of my students, who are, you know, maybe twenty, a real sense of, you know, America's losing it.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"And losing it in the competitive market,",,INFO
"and a real knowl-, uh,",,CAT
"a lack of understanding how that could be. In the sense that how could America have gone from being number one, to possibly being number two,",,QUESTION
"to,",,CAT
"you know, our former enemies and things like that",,INFO
"and, uh, so I see, I see a lot of, uh, a lot of pessimism growing,",,INFO
"um, and at the same time I think there's, there's, there's a growing environmentalist movement and sense of corporate respon-, increased corporate responsible towards, uh, you know, environmental safety and things like that.",,INFO
"And that might potentially be sort of the civil right, the equivalent of the Civil Rights Act in, in the near future, in terms of, you know, some real landmark bills passing and things like that.",,INFO
"Such that, you know, people.",,CAT
The thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now.,,INFO
"I mean my generation doesn't, can't rest on the, the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that, you know, yes there's still some racism",,INFO
"but, you know, basically things are,",,INFO
"the assumption, things are basically kind of taken care of",,INFO
and there's a notion of fairness.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"That's, um,",,CAT
"while still far from perfect, is much more established, I think.",,INFO
"But even, uh, I think, uh, along the line of the, uh, goals of civil rights,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"um, there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone.",,INFO
"Oh, of course",,CAT
"I mean, you know",,CAT
It's human nature,,INFO
"You know, don't like the way you look, don't like the way you dress, don't like your hair, don't like, you know it's just something that always sets people off.",,INFO
"You know, you either like someone or you don't like someone or you're just completely indifferent",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
"And the problem is that ideally you they, you know, the world would like you to be completely indifferent.",,INFO
"So, um, but I, I, I understand what you say about the environmental movement,",,INFO
"um, it's, it's been a long time coming,",,INFO
"um, and being a, uh, a very old hippie",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Yes,,CAT
"I mean, you know, if you had long hair in high school in the sixties, you got labeled a hippie",,CAT
and you keep that image your whole life,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
No matter what you do.,,CAT
"And I, I just,",,CAT
"I've seen a lot of changes, I mean, from the original earth day",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, um, I'm heavily involved in, you know, my own personal recycling.",,INFO
"We recycle paper,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
and cans here at work,,INFO
"and, you know, I do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, all that stuff at home",,INFO
"and I'm starting to see more and more recycling centers,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"cropping up all over the place here, on the,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"east coast,",,INFO
"And that's a real change, except it sort of, brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"like,",,CAT
"I mean, all this recycling used to be in tact, *",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"or not all of it,",,INFO
but much of it did.,,INFO
"I mean, recycling was a, was a wartime thing.",,INFO
"And then they turned around and called them junkyards, and,",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"started making profits off,",,INFO
Yes,,CAT
them after the war.,,INFO
"And now we got to the point where the junkyards, you've got to pay them to take something there,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"so, things have really changed a lot.",,INFO
"I think the, uh, the other part about, uh, America's decline I think has to do with,",,INFO
"A perceived decline anyway, yeah.",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"the perceived decline, has to do with, uh, um, the attitudes and the educational system, uh,",,INFO
"I have children in, in, s-, I have three children in school right now,",,INFO
and I'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them.,,INFO
"Uh, I had,",,CAT
"when I was down in Dallas for two years, I had, uh, my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and words spelled wrong not marked as such.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And this person's teaching my children?,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, I had a real problem with that.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I'd, I'd say actually I mean as someone who's involved in education I'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the, role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society.",,INFO
"I mean, relative pay which is a major way we value people, has been poorer and poorer over the years.",,INFO
"Uh, you know, that",,CAT
there's been cost of living increases,,INFO
but not quite in proportion to cost of living,,INFO
"and, you know it's just more and more, uh, a real low income sort of job and very low prestige.",,INFO
"I mean, there's that, that old saying those who can do it and those who can't teach,",,INFO
.,,CAT
this is the way of let's make fun of the teachers those are the people who can't do anything.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And if you have that kind of social attitude it's hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay, work for low social prestige, just because they care about good education.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And you get more and more people and up there because it's, uh, it's the safety net of those of, you know, average intelligence or something, they can always teach.",,INFO
"Um, I'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in Maryland,",,QUESTION
"but they're trying to get a, uh, a, uh, a merit system here in Maryland rather than a, uh, tenure system,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"for, all the, you know, elementary, middle school and high schools.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So that the teach ...,,CAT
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"uh, let me see, I've got two children.",,INFO
"One is, uh,",,CAT
"both preschoolers,",,INFO
one is two,,INFO
"and one is, uh, four.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, and, uh, this is my first year off,",,INFO
"and I've always worked, uh, from the time that they were little",,INFO
and so I decided to hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and spend some more time with them which I hadn't been doing.,,INFO
"Well, I think that's wonderful.",,INFO
"So,",,CAT
My children are in college.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
But I teach school,,INFO
"and I teach, uh, middle school age children.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And so I see a lot of, uh, variation in what happens when kids are at home.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, I have taught school ever since my children were little.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
But the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's,,INFO
"and your holidays are, too.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So teaching, I think is a, a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids.",,INFO
"Well, that's what I was doing before,",,INFO
I was teaching for Richardson School District.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
And it's really hard.,,INFO
"Well, with them being as young.",,INFO
"It was much, much harder when mine were young.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, I really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his, uh, college work",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and his Master's degree,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and so forth,",,INFO
and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a job.,,INFO
"That's right,",,CAT
that's right.,,CAT
"And that's what was kind of what, where we were, you know,",,INFO
"we, I really didn't have to work,",,INFO
but I felt like I really wanted to work.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I felt, I also felt like, boy, I was sure missing a lot",,INFO
and they were growing so fast,,INFO
"and you know, it's like, do I really need to work, you know?",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I, and it, that choice was there,",,INFO
I really didn't have to,,INFO
"and, you know so I did have that advantage there,",,INFO
"but it's different staying home too, you know.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
it certainly is.,,CAT
"We,",,CAT
"It's an adjustment to make, also.",,INFO
"Well, I think that, uh, we need to spend more family time together with, with children today.",,INFO
"Uh, we made a point to spend a lot of quality time",,INFO
and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"involved in, you know, like, uh, through scouting or",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, anything like that",,INFO
we participated.,,INFO
"And, uh, we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now.",,INFO
"Wow, that's great.",,G_G
"When,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"when, uh, the kids were in high school, it was harder to always have supper together,",,INFO
but we did always have breakfast together.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, we, we had supper together as much as possible,",,INFO
"but when it wasn't feasible, you know, we kind of kept a master calendar",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and when it wasn't feasible, well, that was understandable,",,INFO
but,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, we've always tried to spend time to talk and, uh, have some time, together time",,INFO
"and we sat around the table,",,INFO
we didn't sit in front of a T V or,,INFO
"Wow, that's great.",,G_G
that kind of thing.,,INFO
"So I think that's been important, because we do have a close family",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and even though the kids are basically, uh, grown, uh, they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, have spoken before of, they want that kind of, you know, situation for them when, you know, and their children when they marry and have children.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
kind of goes on.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"They do what they see, you know.",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
They model,,CAT
"and, with the dysfunctional families today, I'm sure, with a, as a schoolteacher also, you see",,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
what happens to these kids,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"when these families never communicate or they're dysfunctional as far as the, between, uh, oh, second families, uh, one parent families or",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
all those kinds of problems that they have,,INFO
and then you see them magnified in the children.,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Plus, you teach middle school,",,INFO
"so I'm sure that,",,CAT
"Oh, boy,",,G_G
yes.,,CAT
"You are really, you really,",,CAT
"boy, oh, boy.",,G_G
I taught early childhood,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
so I had the little ones.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"And, uh, you know, I saw it there, too,",,INFO
"and you, you know, you just oh, it's, it's, kind of an eye-opener.",,INFO
It is.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
It is.,,CAT
"And m-, I think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I think we make a point to do that.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think you're right.,,CAT
"Because we see we see all the time, the outcome of not doing that",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and I think if we weren't so interested i-, in children, in child care, then we wouldn't be teaching anyway.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, I wish we could reach more of the rest of the world",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"I think, uh, the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools,",,INFO
it's what's happening in the families.,,INFO
"I agree,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, they expect us to, you know, have, create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and you get to a point where it's completely impossible.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I agree.,,CAT
"I, I know exactly what you're saying",,G_G
And you just get more and more frustrated,,INFO
"and yet, you feel for the, the kids.",,INFO
You do the best you can,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
,,
"Well, Michael, what do you think about, uh, funding for AIDS research?",,QUESTION
"Do you,",,CAT
"Well, uh, uh, that's something I've thought a lot about.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I, I work in a hospital.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years,,INFO
and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, when they asked us did, did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, I think",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, my, for my personal opinion.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for.",,INFO
I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"or I think they already would have by now, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, so I don't know if, if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now.",,INFO
"I think they're doing the, is as much research as they can possibly do, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, what about you?",,QUESTION
"Well, I guess I'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now",,INFO
I'm not either.,,INFO
You know.,,INFO
I'm definitely not aware of how much.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, that's something I've never really kept up with at all.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, I don't,",,INFO
"I mean, I,",,CAT
go ahead.,,COMMAND
"I'm not sure, uh,",,INFO
"I know, uh, I've always thought more about the disease rather than the der-, research,",,INFO
you know what I mean?,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, that sort of thing.",,CAT
"Uh, if, if we were talking about the money, uh, I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough, simply because I don't know that much about it.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You know,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, I, I can see that research is needed",,INFO
"and, you know,",,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
Definitely.,,CAT
"I think so,",,CAT
I think so.,,CAT
I mean it's becoming a major problem.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I guess the area that I think more about is I would like to see them focus on, uh, preventing it, uh",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"in more,",,INFO
"Well, that's true.",,CAT
That's true,,INFO
You know.,,INFO
"because, uh, it's a, such an easily preventable disease.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"and I,",,INFO
"Uh,",,CAT
"I feel like just saying, uh, safe sex is not the answer.",,INFO
It's,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"it's, uh",,INFO
It's definitely not.,,CAT
abstinence in certain cases,,INFO
and,,CAT
"That's true,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh,",,CAT
"And, knowing, you know,",,CAT
"Myself, uh, uh, I'm just recently, or about to, get a divorce",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, course, I'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody I can or anything.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, it's sort of scary to find yourself single again, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, because you never know what's going to happen",,INFO
"You don't know who you're going to come across, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Course, it's, it's not that I'm wanting to, I'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody I see.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
But it's something you got to think about these days.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
A single person.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know,",,INFO
"and, uh, I mean, it certainly changed my attitude about that",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
in a hurry.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh,",,CAT
I think for a lot of people it has.,,INFO
Certainly.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"But, uh, uh, I know that, uh, in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"to prevent, you know, so that, uh, the drug addicts",,INFO
Drug addicts.,,INFO
won't be,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
getting dirty needles and everything.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, I don't know,",,CAT
I don't think that's a bad idea.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I know it, uh, sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It just sort of keeps that going.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, I don't know,",,CAT
"at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS, so far, cannot be.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know,",,INFO
"so, I don't know,",,CAT
"that, I think that's,",,INFO
"I'm not too a-, much against the, the passing out of the free syringes myself.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
what do you think about that?,,QUESTION
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
boy,,CAT
"It, *",,CAT
that's a hard issue,,INFO
It really is.,,INFO
It really is.,,CAT
It really is.,,G_G
They gave us a hard topic,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"I mean, I, I definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed,",,INFO
"but as you say, uh, people, I mean, in the meantime,",,INFO
well,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"someone who's not ready to give up drugs, uh,",,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
You know.,,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
"If they're perp-, perpetrating the AIDS problem, passing that on to each other, then",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"You know, I guess if you consider the two problems, drug addiction and AIDS",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"AIDS would have to come first, I guess, as far as",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"something to, to do about it.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, so I don't know.",,INFO
"Uh, course, there's so many things in the world where, if you solve one problem, you may be creating another you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, so I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Which is the most important to solve at the time,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I don't know.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, but I've never looked into how much money they're spending.",,INFO
"I have, I have no idea.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I know a lot of our tax money goes to that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, I really have never looked into it.",,INFO
I have no idea.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I haven't either.,,INFO
"I've heard, you know, uh",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
different voices,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
speaking up and saying we're not spending enough,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
sure.,,CAT
"Mostly that's what I've heard,",,INFO
"so I don't know,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, yet, I know it's, uh, it sounds like big money to me",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
But it,,INFO
I think it is.,,CAT
probably takes,,INFO
I think it is.,,CAT
a lot.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it does every,",,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"It seems to take more than, uh, for any little thing they do,",,INFO
it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
You know.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh,",,CAT
"Did you have any fear working in the hospital with that,",,QUESTION
That's one thing I've never really feared.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, uh, I,",,CAT
"a lot of the, my family, you know, they fear me working like that and, under some, some of those conditions,",,INFO
"but, uh",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, I don't fear it at all.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I work in, in the operating room a lot",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, and, of course, when w-,",,CAT
,,
Are you a player?,,QUESTION
"Uh, I, I think I am.",,CAT
"It's, it's been a while now",,INFO
Has it?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I've, uh, oh,",,CAT
just recently I got married,,INFO
and we bought a house.,,INFO
We're about fifty yards from the golf course,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
but unfortunately the house is taking up my time.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So it's been, uh, it's been almost a year, I guess, since I've actually, uh, swung a club for a purpose.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I hav-, I haven't played in about two years,",,INFO
and then I went out two weeks ago with the guys here.,,INFO
I work at T I.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And I played in a tournament out there,",,INFO
and I shot a net fifty-nine.,,INFO
"They were kind of, little upset.",,INFO
.,,CAT
I guess I laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"I have a hard time inventing shots, you know.",,INFO
"Let's go around this tree, and",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"you know, try a slice through a hook here,",,INFO
and I can't do that,,INFO
so.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"I finally got out,",,INFO
and I've been watching quite a few videos.,,INFO
I had not been able to play,,INFO
"so I took out a few videos and watched them for a while,",,INFO
"and I, I hope I'm on the right track.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Shot a career low eighty-nine, so, and my handicap is twenty nine.",,INFO
"That's, that's great.",,G_G
I like that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Now it's, uh, like I say, it's been a while for me, too.",,INFO
"I, uh, I've got my wife motivated about it, um",,INFO
Really.,,CAT
"and, uh, I think that's probably going to be one of the next investments, is get her, get her a set of clubs",,INFO
"and, uh, we'll get out of the driving range and, and get some interest built up",,INFO
"and hopefully we can, uh, we can start in.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I've tried to get my wife,",,INFO
I bought her a set of clubs four years ago.,,INFO
"She hasn't even swung them,",,INFO
but,,INFO
Really.,,CAT
"she wants to get into it now after I came home and won the tournament the other day,",,INFO
she's,,INFO
"Well, great, great.",,G_G
"That's good,",,G_G
"she's ready to get off into it,",,INFO
"but, you know, I like, I just like getting out, being in the outdoors,",,INFO
"and I'm a hunter and fisher anyway,",,INFO
"but, you know.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
same thing here.,,INFO
"You know, at least I can get out and play a few hours of golf",,INFO
"and it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg, really.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"And I, you know, I walk,",,INFO
I don't ride,,INFO
so,,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"you know, I get a little exercise there, too,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"That's,",,CAT
I've got the same attitude.,,INFO
"I, uh, I tell you,",,CAT
"I started,",,CAT
"I guess, the first time I played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now, when I was in college.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, I took, uh, I took it as a P E course and then kind of left it alone for a while,",,INFO
"and then finally got, got into it when I was, while I was still in school",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and since then, uh, we've made it, um,",,INFO
"as, as the friends start getting married and things like that, we've made a tradition of, uh, having a, a Thursday, um,",,INFO
"well, have, have probably like, like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, so, it,",,CAT
that's back in South Dakota where I grew up,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"and, uh, so that, that's, uh, that's been my main, my main involvement,",,INFO
"is it seems like I go home and play golf more than I do around here,",,INFO
"but, uh",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"eventually I get people to come and visit me in Dallas,",,INFO
and then I'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
it's pretty nice.,,INFO
We played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not.,,INFO
They were amazed.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, here it is, sixty-five degrees,",,INFO
"we're out playing golf,",,INFO
"and they're freezing cold back there,",,INFO
so.,,INFO
"Yep,",,CAT
yep.,,CAT
"But, I, uh, actually I picked it up when I was in high school, on the same as a P E course, you know,",,INFO
when I got into the service I got into it,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"and now when I come out here I just kind of let it go,",,INFO
"and then one, one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if I played golf.",,INFO
"And I said, Well, yeah, you know,",,INFO
"I've got my clubs,",,INFO
but I haven't swung them in quite a few years.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And then I got into it and then back out of it,",,INFO
and it just seems like every couple of years I get back in there,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's right.,,CAT
"You know, I really enjoy it.",,INFO
It's really nice.,,INFO
"Oh, it is, it's, it's a lot of fun, especially if you can find somebody that's, uh, that's got the same level of interest.",,INFO
That seem to be the hardest,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
thing.,,INFO
"Well, about,",,CAT
"that's, that's true of any sport, you know.",,INFO
"If you want to play tennis, or",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"racquetball,",,INFO
"you don't want to go out and get beat to death,",,INFO
but.,,CAT
"Right,",,CAT
"and, and people don't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time, you know",,INFO
No.,,CAT
"and, and, uh,",,CAT
"And then, you know, we've got some guys here that they are, you know, four and five handicappers",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they don't like to play with me because I'm too slow for them,",,INFO
so.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"You know, but get somebody around your own handicap, and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time.",,INFO
"That's right,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"And I've, you know, I've",,CAT
"never, never yet have I walked up,",,INFO
"now I've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with,",,INFO
and never yet have I met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome.,,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
They are always friendly.,,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
"Sure, come on out, you know,",,INFO
"and they don't mind if you make a mistake,",,INFO
"they don't mind saying, Well, you know, let me tea-, tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that, or,",,INFO
Well.,,CAT
"You know, it's, it's pretty nice and friendly out there",,INFO
"That, that's, that's so.",,CAT
and you can't find that in all sports.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's absolutely right,",,CAT
"and you can gain a lot of ground doing that, too, if you, if, you know,",,INFO
"you gets, you get in a rut if you do play a lot",,INFO
"but you play with the same people, you, you aren't going to learn anything.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"After a short period, once you learn everything they've got to offer,",,INFO
then,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you need to,",,INFO
you've basically tapped your resources there.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, I'd like to, uh, eventually I'd like to work up, if, if my wife does get interested, and maybe get involved in a league in a, in a mixed, mixed doubles league, or something like that.",,INFO
"Oh yeah,",,CAT
"we , we have one down here in the summertime.",,INFO
"Uh, it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"or eight o'clock, you know, because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
And we play in the summertime out here.,,INFO
"We get a mixed league in,",,INFO
and that's what I'm trying to get her ready for.,,INFO
"It's going to start, well, when we change time back whenever that is",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"next month, I guess,",,INFO
"and it will start then,",,INFO
"and, you know, we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago,",,INFO
"and they were just starting to learn,",,INFO
"and, you know, they were shooting a hundred, hundred and twenty",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"but they were, you know,",,CAT
now they're down into the hundreds,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"nineties,",,INFO
"so, it won't take her long.",,INFO
"Well, that's good",,G_G
"You know,",,INFO
"that's good, that's sounds like a lot of fun.",,INFO
"And it's something we can do together,",,INFO
"so. Well, she doesn't do much hunting,",,INFO
she could care less about that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"She's does a little fishing,",,INFO
"but, you know, golf would give her the exercise,",,INFO
"she'd be outside,",,INFO
"give her something to do that we both enjoy,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it, it sounds like we've got real similar situations.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I, I go home, uh, I've gone home every year now since I've moved to Dallas to, to go pheasant hunting,",,INFO
"and, uh",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"um, the, the last time I, I took my wife along",,INFO
"and, uh, k-, kind of the same situation.",,INFO
"She's, she's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff,",,INFO
"but,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"She'll definitely, uh, she'll make the trip for fishing",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"if that comes along,",,INFO
"but, uh",,INFO
All right.,,CAT
"it's, it's interesting,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and it's, you know, it's a game that you don't,",,INFO
"like bowling, you know, you feel bad if you bowl a hundred.",,INFO
"But if you shoot a hundred in golf, you know,",,INFO
"you don't have to be an expert to play,",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
Any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, you know, you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all.",,INFO
"That's right,",,CAT
"well, yeah,",,CAT
"I've, I've kind of formed the attitude that, you know, if I could just, if I could pick two or three shots out, uh, out of my game every time and put them together on one hole, then I do pretty good",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and then, and I keep, I keep rationalizing that well, you know, I can do it,",,INFO
"I just got to do it all at th-, on the same hole,",,INFO
"and, and then it will get better,",,INFO
"and you just keep going,",,INFO
"and in the meantime, just enjoy what you're doing.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It, it, it really works that way",,INFO

and I didn't get it done.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know,",,CAT
"and I just, well, I need to slice this ball around here,",,INFO
"I naturally slice anyway,",,INFO

.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I never broke a club or anything,",,CAT
"but, you know",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I'd get upset about it sometimes,",,INFO
"and now I guess, you know, being in my forties, I just kind of mellowed out a little bit.",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
I don't get upset any more.,,INFO
"So, and,",,CAT

"Oh, did you?",,QUESTION
"I went to the flea markets and bought, you know, like the wigs for a dollar.",,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
Then I cut a V shape out of the back of them,,INFO

and then sewed them on.,,INFO
It sounds like you're creative.,,INFO
They looked really cute,,INFO
"Uh, do you sell them?",,QUESTION

"and it's sitting in my closet half done right now,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"but, it's a knitting one.",,INFO
"And,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I tried knitting first,",,INFO
"but, I don't know,",,CAT
"I, I didn't like it.",,INFO
"Oh, didn't you.",,CAT
"So then I went to crocheting,",,INFO
but now I want to learn how to knit again.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"I en-,",,CAT
You know.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
I enjoy knitting.,,INFO
"I, I kind of like that,",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I do like sewing sometimes.,,INFO
"I, I've made a few of the, you know, just the little valence curtains in my house, and",,INFO

Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, that's neat.",,G_G
"I haven't done everything on it yet, you know,",,INFO
"but just what little bit I have used it for, I really like it.",,INFO
"Oh, those are wonderful aren't they.",,INFO
"You know, especially making the seams and things like that you know, it's, it's got such a professional finish on them.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"that, and that's what I hate doing is the finishing stuff.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It'd be nice to have that.,,INFO
So I like that.,,INFO
"Oh, that's neat.",,G_G
And.,,CAT
"Well, do you have, um, uh,",,QUESTION
"I guess you're kind of young,",,INFO
"I was going to say, do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for.",,QUESTION
"Well, fifty-seven's not young,",,INFO
"but no,",,CAT
"my son's, has been married for almost ten years,",,INFO
but they don't have any children.,,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"So, I just make clothes for my dolls.",,INFO
"Oh, well.",,CAT
.,,CAT
"Well, how did you get involved in that?",,QUESTION
"Just, you know, just like sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and try to make a doll.",,INFO
"So you did buy a pattern, and then started from there.",,INFO
"And they, they turned out really cute.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
you got to have a pattern for the body,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
you know.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh,",,CAT
"Ha-, have you ever seen those bunnies",,QUESTION

dress one of those.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I have quite a few of them actually in my house,",,INFO
"I, and most of them I have bought, um, already clothed,",,INFO
but I did,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I did make the dress on one,",,INFO
and I kind of made the pattern up.,,INFO
"It's not, it's probably not the best",,INFO
but,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"I, I bought a bunny pattern one time,",,INFO
"but when I sewed it up, the face of it looked like a mouse.",,INFO
"Oh, it did?",,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
"See, it was too pointed.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"So I tore it back apart again,",,INFO
and I haven't tried another one.,,INFO
"You haven't sewn it back up, huh?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"but I bought a little lamb pattern and the material and everything to make it out of,",,INFO
but I haven't made it yet.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, do you do any kind of painting or anything?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
I don't,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"paint, except I stenciled my wall.",,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
.,,CAT
"I tri-, I tried that,",,INFO
"I did, I, I ended up just stenciling a, um, a blind, like a, just a roller shade.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, I, I can, I had a hard time stenciling.",,INFO
For some reason I just couldn't do it.,,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
And people have told me it's very easy.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"I, my neighbor did it first",,INFO
and I seen her house,,INFO
"and I saw how beautiful it looked,",,INFO
"so then I decided well, I was going to do it,",,INFO
and,,INFO
Well.,,CAT
"uh, it turned out really, really good.",,INFO
What design did you use?,,QUESTION
"Uh, mostly flowers",,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
you know.,,INFO
"And, what room?",,QUESTION
"I've done it in the all, uh, all my rooms.",,INFO
Have you?,,QUESTION
"I put it in the bedrooms and the bathroom,",,INFO
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
now you can tell me what you do.,,COMMAND
"Uh, well, I work with computers, just like your son",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I actually do research in speech recognition,,INFO
"Oh, great.",,G_G
part of the reason I'm participating in the project,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
is to see how the stuff goes.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, um, I was working",,INFO
"well, actually I haven't worked for any large companies per se",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, recently",,INFO
but hopefully the job that I will have will have lots of benefits,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
namely lots of vacations,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
not real good salary but lots of vacations.,,INFO
"Well, the one John works for seems to have a l-, you know, good benefits,",,INFO
and the pay is decent.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"the, uh,",,CAT
"well actually, where I was working the company",,INFO
one of the companies I was working for actually had very good health care benefits,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
which these days I think are really important,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
because health care is so ridiculously expensive.,,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"Because we're, we're paying our own insurance right now.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"But and I'm,",,CAT
we actually had a little baby,,INFO
"Oh,",,CAT
so I'm taking a little bit of a time off from work.,,INFO
"Great,",,G_G
"I had, I had a granddaughter",,INFO
"Oh, congratulations.",,G_G
And so one thing that I'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits,,INFO
because it's more important with a family,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and you know, our doctor's vi-, routine doctor's visits covered,",,INFO
"my health insurance only covers, um, the emergency care.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Do you have major medical benefits?,,QUESTION
"Right, yeah,",,CAT
"but I don't,",,INFO
"That, that helps some,",,INFO
"if,",,CAT
it depends on what your deductible is,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
how high it is.,,INFO
"Well, my,",,CAT
our deductible's five hundred,,INFO
but it's for each,,INFO
Each person.,,INFO
event.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's pretty har-, that's pretty high,",,INFO
Right,,CAT
"but, you know, so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
it doesn't cover,,INFO
"That's, that's right.",,G_G
"doctor's visits, things like that.",,INFO
And five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your,,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
it certainly is.,,INFO
"major medical, too.",,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I know where my daughter works,",,INFO
"now she, she,",,CAT
"course we live in a, a rural sort of setting",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and where she works she has no benefits at all.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"And her wage is not, not very good",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But it's, it's the type of area we live in.",,INFO
"Of course, living expenses aren't as bad either, though, which makes a difference.",,INFO
"And probably the medical care is less expensive, too.",,INFO
"Well, she has to pay for it herself",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, they have to pay for their own insurance.",,INFO
"But, uh",,CAT
"So I think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there,",,INFO
"and so the insurance would cost lower,",,INFO
"Uh, well, from what I've seen,",,INFO
"from my aunt and uncle really from Florida up to here,",,INFO
they're not that much different.,,INFO
"Well, I know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan.,,INFO
Is that right?,,QUESTION
"And they were at one of the better hospitals, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, you know, good doctors in Boston.",,INFO
Wow,,G_G
that's a big difference.,,G_G
And I was at one of the big hospitals in New York.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
But that's a huge difference just between,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, and it's two big cities that I think of as somewhat comparable.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
should be.,,INFO
So I was pretty shocked at that.,,INFO
"But the other thing that I'm really concerned about,",,INFO
"and most companies don't have,",,INFO
"some are starting to have, is day care",,INFO
Yes. Uh-huh.,,CAT
"because it would be really nice to be able to have, you know, someone that could watch my daughter at work.",,INFO
"And I'd go to work,",,INFO
"and if she were sick I could go down and see her, if she needs to be fed, whatever.",,INFO
And it would be much more convenient.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"And I,",,CAT
"it would be more convenient, too.",,INFO
"It would be more convenient, more productive",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"I think,",,INFO
"My other daughter works and has,",,INFO
"they have to take their two children to day care, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, it, it's,",,CAT
"I don't know how they do it,",,INFO
"I really don't. You know,",,INFO
"getting them there and then, and going to work, and then picking them up and,",,INFO
"And, and your hours are,",,INFO
all the preparations.,,INFO
much more constrained and things like that.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, that, to me, well, that, you know,",,CAT
"those three things, the health care, vacation, and day care",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
are probably the most important benefits.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I suppose I should be concerned with life insurance and, uh, retirement plans",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Oh, I don't know,",,CAT
"I think those benefits you mentioned, sometimes they're even more important than you-, the wage itself.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"If you can get those benefits even, uh,",,INFO
"they, they come out to much, a much better benefit than, than an increase in your wage a lot of times.",,INFO
Right,,CAT
"because you're, you know,",,CAT
certainly something like day care at the work place,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
would make life so much simpler,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"that it's worth paying, you know, having a lower salary.",,INFO
I would certainly accept a lower,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
salary for that.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
it would make it a lot better.,,INFO
"You know, everything else being equal",,INFO
because your life would be so much easier.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And there's a question of quality of life also.,,INFO
"Uh, well, and if it was there, you would really have a little more, uh, knowledge on what's going on",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"probably, you know, with your child.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"and, you, you, you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
something happened.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, you're less preoccupied with it, I think.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But unfortunately, there aren't,",,INFO
I think I B M has started having that in certain locations.,,INFO
"I don't know,",,CAT
"my daughter, one daughter works for M C I,",,INFO
"and they don't, they, where she works they don't have anything like that.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Is that locally?,,QUESTION
"Uh, Pittsburgh.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"because Pittsburgh's a big enough city, too.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
things like that.,,INFO
Because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Like, uh, one company had proposed to me that I could come back to work after having the baby, um, any where between ten and forty hours a week.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, um, call my own days, call my own hours,",,INFO
"Oh, so they were very flexible",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and that, that would be great,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
and which,,CAT
many times at a large company it's almost impossible,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
to do things like that.,,INFO
"They say you're going to do it this way, and that's the way it's going to be.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"And if you get two weeks off, you get two weeks off",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and you're not allowed two weeks and one day.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"So it all depends on what your position is there, too.",,INFO
"True,",,G_G
"well, that's true in any, any company, I think.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I've, I've never, well I can't say I've never,",,CAT
I've maybe worked five years out of our married life,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"out of the ho-, you know, out of the home",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but, uh, the rest of the time I've been an Avon lady and a lady.",,INFO
"Was that when you were, um, well,",,QUESTION
"those have its pluses and minuses, too.",,INFO
I've been a consultant recently,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and so I don't have any benefits at all,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"Right,",,CAT
and the same thing,,CAT
my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
than what he is,,INFO
"and, um, they, they, they,",,CAT
Usually consultants make very good income.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"and they, they refuse to give him more salary.",,INFO
Is that right?,,QUESTION
"Because they say they can't pay more than this and that, and they're not allowed to pay him more",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
than what his previous salary was and things like that,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, you know, times are rough now,",,INFO
"so it's, new,",,CAT
it's harder to get,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"the, uh, you know, increases and things",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but, um,",,CAT
"A consultant really is, should be more knowledgeable than everybody else, you know",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well he's,",,INFO
"so it stands to reason they should really ha-, have more benefits.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"well, he's been doing a long term,",,INFO
"he's being called a consultant,",,INFO
and he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, they, they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits,",,INFO
"he doesn't get, well",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
we don't care about retirement benefits.,,INFO
"He doesn't get, um, vacation benefits",,INFO
and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
he does a lot of things that get factored into somebody else's salary.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So really his salary should be, you know, twenty percent or thirty percent higher",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"just based on that, not including",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"the fact that you know, it's a less, long term commitment for the company",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and all that sort of stuff.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and they'll do it,",,INFO
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"All right,",,CAT
"well, I'm not a big exerciser,",,INFO
but I kind of had to start after I had my baby because I wanted to lose that extra weight.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And so basically at this point I'm, I'm a real walker.",,INFO
"I am, too.",,INFO
Are you?,,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
"I don't do that, oh, I guess I'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips, you know, and",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
keep their arms up.,,INFO
I don't do that.,,INFO
"I mostly just take a, a walk around the block or with my baby",,INFO
"or, you know, and I have to do that at least once a day. If it,",,INFO
"Oh, that's good.",,G_G
"If it's going to make any effect on, since I have to eat the same as I did before.",,INFO
I can't neglect that because of the baby either.,,INFO
And how old is your baby?,,QUESTION
"She just, uh, well, she was premature,",,INFO
"so she's about nine months now, though.",,INFO
"Goll-, times goes fast.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Well, I walk two and a half to three miles every night.",,INFO
"Oh, that's great.",,G_G
My husband and I were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and he lost sixty-two pounds,,INFO
.,,CAT
and I lost twenty-one.,,INFO
"Oh, my goodness.",,G_G
"So we've decided to maintain our weight, that we will do this exercise walking program",,INFO
and we walk our dog every night,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and go up around the elementary school.,,INFO
We have a little path that we do.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, except if it's raining or real cold",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
which it hasn't been,,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
"we try to get out, uh, every, every night.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And he plays racquetball twice a week,",,INFO
"but I'm not into that,",,INFO
so,,INFO
.,,CAT
I think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned.,,INFO
"Well, I think that is just wonderful.",,INFO
"Now, as far as I'm concerned, I have several other children",,INFO
"and so, uh, I think at this point to fit it into, to other things, it's kind of a task.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"You know. Uh, it's not to where I'm just so freed up that I, I just go, oh, this is wonderful,",,INFO
let's go,,INFO
Right,,CAT
that's right.,,CAT
I know my kids are into sports,,INFO
"and a lot of times, tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty",,INFO
so we will just go out after that.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, my kids, luckily, are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I go out and walk.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Now, does your husband usually go with you, then?",,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
"Oh, see, now that's really nice.",,G_G
Yes.,,CAT
Because mine's at meetings sometimes,,INFO
"and, and he's not really into it",,INFO
so,,CAT
No,,CAT
"I have to,",,INFO
my husband never was either until he lost the weight.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That was his decision.,,INFO
He had arthritis in his hips,,INFO
and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise.,,INFO
I think that is so wonderful.,,INFO
"So once he got motivated, now he's ready to walk every night.",,INFO
And our dog has lost a little weight.,,INFO
"He walks every night, too",,INFO
.,,CAT
"So, he gets excited when he sees us put on our, our shoes, our walking shoes.",,INFO
I bet.,,G_G
"I think that's really, really good.",,INFO
"And, and, you know, I think this, after you've done it a certain amount of time, it kind of does get to be a routine.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"It's not,",,CAT
"like when I first started, it, you know, that was the hardest thing was",,INFO
Making time for it.,,INFO
to get ready and get out there.,,INFO
"But now if I haven't done it in a day or two or something, I really notice that I haven't done it in a ...",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"You know. And I like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me",,INFO
and sometimes they don't.,,INFO
"And when they don't, I, I really notice, you know, how fun it can be when they come.",,INFO
"So, uh, I like to have somebody come with me.",,INFO
"I know,",,CAT

"Well, I think that's great.",,INFO
"I, and, well, sometimes when I, I take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise I, I really think I do.",,INFO
I was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I found real quick that wasn't for me.",,INFO
"Me, too.",,INFO
I did the dance step when I lived up in,,INFO

and it just wore me out.,,INFO
I would leave totally exhausted.,,INFO
"I never lost any weight,",,INFO
and I got to the point I dreaded going in.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT

So walking seems to be a good solution for me,,INFO
and it doesn't cost anything,,INFO
Right,,CAT
right.,,CAT
And it gives me time to think.,,INFO
"So I think, not only does it help my body,",,INFO
but I think it helps my mind,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
too.,,INFO
So I like that.,,INFO
That's the one time in the day my husband and I can get away and talk,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
without having the kids jump in and ...,,INFO

need something,,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, not on the nights that I do aerobics,",,INFO
"but if, if he wants to, he jogs,",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And so, we, we, take it seriously.",,INFO
We enjoy doing it.,,INFO
.,,CAT
I enjoy my group at school.,,INFO
It is a lot more fun to exercise with somebody,,INFO

than is is to do it by yourself.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, well I use to exercise regularly",,INFO

"Oh, oh",,CAT

"But, uh, I guess my job change, my husband's job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more.",,INFO
Oh I understand that.,,G_G
"So, uh,",,CAT

I just want to go home and not do anything.,,INFO
"Well, I and too. I just make myself.",,INFO

Oh.,,CAT
"School is not over until, uh, four",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and our class,",,INFO

Oh.,,CAT
that is the big difference,,INFO
"because there are other people around that, uh,",,INFO
you had better hurry.,,CAT
Go get dressed.,,CAT
"You know, there is motivation around there",,INFO
"and then, uh, we, we can change right there in the building.",,INFO
I don't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I just go,,INFO
"and we, uh, exercise.",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
and that is just too long.,,INFO
I have twenty-five minutes for lunch.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
That is out for me.,,INFO
"That doesn't really do it, does it?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
I don't think so.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, and they are nice because if we are running late, it usually, uh,",,INFO
"if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late, they kind of wait on us.",,INFO
"You know, cause they know we are in the building and coming.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Where as, at, uh, another place, you are paying a lot more money",,INFO
"and, uh, it does going to start whether you are there or not",,INFO
That is right,,CAT
That is right.,,CAT
So this has worked out real nicely.,,INFO
"In fact, she charges us two dollars a session.",,INFO
"Well, that is not much.",,G_G
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"So it's, it's,",,CAT
we like pay her for six weeks at a time,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"cause that is like a unit in, uh, uh, school",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, report card period",,INFO
and so it is like twenty-four dollars every six weeks.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
That is not bad.,,G_G
Huh-uh.,,CAT
It beats memberships at some of these clubs.,,G_G
That is for sure.,,G_G
You are not kidding.,,G_G
They are real expensive.,,INFO
I know.,,CAT
"We belonged, uh, for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean, we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
and at first we used it,,INFO
and then it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And they offered lots of things,",,INFO
but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
So we decided to forget that.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That was just a waste of our our money.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Well we have one through work,,INFO
"and its, its probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year. Which is bad. *",,INFO
Oh no.,,G_G
"But, I, uh, I don't know",,INFO
"I still just don't don't end up going cause it isn't at a convenient time or I don't know something,",,INFO
but I need to do something.,,INFO
"If, if its only walk the dog or something.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I need to start doing that.,,INFO
It does make you feel better.,,INFO
The hard thing is getting going.,,INFO
That is right.,,CAT
"And if you have somebody who will do it with you,",,INFO
"like, for a long time my husband didn't want to walk cause he wants to, uh, jog",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but he decided that, uh, maybe, uh, you know,",,INFO
,,
"We're supposed to talk about the Middle East Crisis,",,INFO

"and should we be involved and, uh, what's it going to cost us in the long run.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
Are you ready?,,QUESTION
I guess so.,,CAT
The Middle East Crisis should we be there?,,QUESTION
"Oh, dear that's a hard one.",,CAT
"That's really hard for me because, uh, you know, I really, I have a son that's sixteen",,INFO
"and I think, you know, eventually, you know, he'll be of, of drafting age.",,INFO
"And I think gosh, do I want him to go",,INFO
and yet I'm proud to be an American,,INFO
"and I know that we have a country that, you know, people would give anything to live in, a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have.",,INFO
"And yet, I don't know whether I'd be willing to give his life for, for this country",,INFO
"and yet, and yet, I know that I, that,",,CAT
"and I, I, when I was in school it was always the tired, the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism",,INFO
"but I'm not sure that that's the reason anymore. I mean, not sure that communism is, is as strong as it once was.",,INFO
"And I'm not sure that, that that's the reason why we're, like we were in Vietnam supposedly so.",,INFO
"Well, you realize why we were in the Middle East. Why we invaded Iraq, why we were",,QUESTION
"Well, with the,",,CAT
"in Saudi, why we attacked Kuwait and we we're, why we are still fighting Iraq.",,INFO
"Well, it's because of oil isn't it?",,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
"I really believe it's because,",,INFO
"I think it has something to do with oil, don't get me wrong.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But Saddam is, Saddam is a madman.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
I agree with that.,,INFO
"Anyone that would use chemical weapons to fight his own people,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
"he's, uh, a bad person, very definitely,",,INFO
"And,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"obviously, that has something to do with it.",,INFO
"Oh, sure.",,CAT
"And, and if, you know,",,CAT
I can see that he was in Kuwait,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Kuwait was the nonaggressor,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
and the Saudis are our allies.,,INFO
We have several treaties and several alliances with the Saudis that range back for probably forty years.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
many years.,,INFO
You know they've been our friends through thick and thin.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"They,",,INFO
"Well,",,CAT
were at the Saudi border.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And ready to storm into Saudi.,,INFO
Shouldn't we try and help our friends?,,QUESTION
"Certainly,",,CAT
"but what at, at what cost, you know,",,QUESTION
"that's the, uh, the thing, it came out, it came out wonderfully supposedly",,INFO
I mean everything is,,CAT
"What did we lose,",,QUESTION
and we won.,,INFO
"forty-one Americans,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
lives.,,INFO
"and that, that's wonderful",,INFO
"but what if, if that wasn't the case.",,QUESTION
What if we would have lost thousands of young men.,,QUESTION
"Would that, would it have been too much of a price to pay for that?",,QUESTION
I don't know.,,INFO
"See, and I think there are a lot of things that we don't know",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Oh,",,CAT
"that,",,INFO
"of course,",,INFO
"the American people,",,CAT
"our government is full of liars, thieves, and crooks.",,INFO
"Oh, sure.",,CAT
"Well, and there's a lot,",,INFO
"And that's,",,INFO
"that we,",,INFO
our own fault because we elected them.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I think that's true,,INFO
"but I think there's a lot that we, the public doesn't need to know.",,INFO
"I think there's some things we shouldn't know just for nation-, national security sake.",,INFO
"And I, you know, I think if we did know I think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because I don't, I don't think people could handle it.",,INFO
"So I think there are things that we should not know, the masses shouldn't know",,INFO
but I also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too.,,INFO
"You know, it's, uh,",,CAT
I went on jury duty here not long back.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And uh, one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if, if you could believe a lawyer or if a,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed,,INFO
"and one guy being selected snickered and couldn't keep his head up, you know,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and the guy said, Well, can you share it with us what you, what you find so funny?",,INFO
"He says, Well, I already told you my sons a lawyer.",,INFO
"He said that when he graduated, the day after his bar examine",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
there in Houston.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"He told him, Dad, you know how to tell when a lawyers lying to you?",,INFO
His lips are moving.,,INFO
"Oh, my gosh",,G_G
Oh.,,CAT
"And ninety percent of all politicians,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and lawyers,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Have a lawyer background,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"Have a law background,",,INFO
you're right.,,INFO
So by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars.,,INFO
The fact that they take our money and don't do what we think is right makes them thieves.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
So what's it going to cost us in the long run there in Saudi?,,QUESTION
Are we going to lose more lives there?,,QUESTION
"See, and I don't know, I don't know I can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it.",,INFO
I mean I thought the war was going to go on and on.,,INFO
I really was surprised when it ended so quickly,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Well, we hit them with more in one month than we used in three years, the last three years of Vietnam.",,INFO
I know.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And whenever you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
there's nothing they can do about it.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
You know it's not like we threw eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"We were there,",,INFO
the Brits were there.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
The French were there.,,INFO
This is with U N backing,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and to some level even Russia was behind.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Right,",,CAT
they were.,,INFO
"So honestly if there is, was a well perceived war, world wide this was it.",,INFO
"Oh, sure.",,CAT
Sure.,,CAT
"But what I can't understand is then many of the Kuwaiti youth didn't fight, wouldn't fight.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
It's okay for us to go extend our youth's lives like so much water in the desert.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
And it's not their job to fight for their own land.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that is very it's very strange.,,INFO
"Uh, and yet, you know, see that's another thing that, that's difficult for Americans,",,INFO
"their culture is so much different than ours, you know,",,INFO
"I've heard from many people that we could not even begi-, begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours",,INFO
"and, um, they just don't think the same way we do.",,INFO
Their culture is completely different and almost opposite.,,INFO
"And really from all I can indica-, from all indications the Iraqi beliefs, if you will, are more similar to our own.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
.,,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
And the Kuwaitis aren't even helping rebuild their own country.,,INFO
The Kuwaiti young won't rebuild anything.,,INFO
They won't work.,,INFO
"Uh, I didn't realize that.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
it was on the news last night.,,INFO
"Oh, my word.",,G_G
"The, uh, U S Army is doing it all.",,INFO

"See and that's another question you have to ask, is this our job?",,INFO
"Is, are we, should we still be there even, you know?",,QUESTION
I don't know the answers to those questions.,,INFO
I think they're tough,,INFO
"and I think, you know, it's,",,INFO
I don't know that anybody knows the answers.,,INFO
I think they know what they believe,,INFO
but I'm not sure they really are one hundred percent sure.,,INFO
"Well, they talked to one Kuwaiti woman yesterday.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And her biggest concern in life was that she couldn't get a housekeeper.,,INFO
You're kidding.,,G_G
That's unreal.,,INFO
"And, do you have a housekeeper?",,QUESTION
No,,CAT
"No,",,CAT

Sure.,,CAT
Sure.,,CAT

I read in today's paper they just canceled that show.,,INFO
It is a real different one.,,INFO
"It's, uh, it's, it's different.",,INFO
I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.,,INFO

"But,",,CAT
"Have you seen the show, it's, it's new this year, called HOME FRONT?",,QUESTION

"You're twenty-nine,",,CAT
"okay,",,CAT
"so we're, we're both children of the very early sixties.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, I have, I mean I've seen some change,",,INFO
"like I know, um, when I was young most mothers pretty much were housewives,",,INFO
"Um, um.",,CAT
"and stayed at home with the kids,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and to, to me it seems like its almost the opposite now where the, the woman is working and,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they, you know, take the children to child care,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
or maybe they work part-time or something.,,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, that seems to be a pretty big change.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"the family structure in general is being really restructured from one income to two incomes which means from one parent to two part-time parents,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
if you're lucky,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"Um, I, uh,",,CAT
"it, it's funny,",,INFO
"it's both of us then were really just adolescents when, when,",,INFO
"I think, most of the major changes for adult women were going on,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
in America.,,INFO
"I don't think, changes are still progressing,",,INFO
"but it seems to me that the, uh, really the seventies, the early seventies was a period of the most change,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, if I had to somewhat abstract about it, it seems to be the major change has been that woman have acquired more choice.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Oh, that's true.",,CAT
That's true.,,CAT
"Uh, I mean, that's sort of the overall, the meta, the meta change as it were. Uh, where that woman really have more of a choice now about what they do.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, course, they find that the choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if it is for your, you know,",,INFO
"you can share something you really want, which is a wonderful thing,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but, it does seem",,INFO
"like an awful lot of my, uh, my adult women friends are anguishing over, over some of, some of these choices.",,INFO
"Um,",,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"Well, I know, the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because I think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you, you know, you protected the children,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and you want to be with the children,",,INFO
"yet there's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think, oh, but, if we both work, we can get a really big house,",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"and we can have two really nice cars, we can take a vacation, we can do this,",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
and it's kind of almost expected of you anyway.,,INFO
"People kind of look down on a, on a, you know, the role of a woman as a housewife,",,INFO
"it's kind of like, oh, well, you know, she didn't go to college,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and she's just a housewife.,,INFO
She just settled for that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"Even though there's probably women with M B A's, maybe even Ph D's, that are staying at home with the children.",,INFO
"Um,",,CAT
"Well, I only know,",,INFO
"I have,",,INFO
"of my friends who have, have children, uh,",,INFO
"I only know of one woman who's decided to go that quote, unquote, traditional route.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, I have a lot of respect for her, because she made it as a real choice.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"She really knew that she didn't have to do that,",,INFO
but she decided that was what she wanted to do in her life.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, she wanted that role.",,INFO
She's a marvelous parent,,INFO
"and I, you know, I say all power to her because she's an example to me of someone who really does have the choice.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I feel that a lot of, uh, women don't,",,INFO
all right I said they have the choice,,INFO
"but they don't necessarily feel that they do because they no longer feel like if they were just to be a parent rather than, uh, you know, a sort of super woman success in the business world as well,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"they would somehow be perceived as a failure,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"in their own eyes or in others,",,INFO
"and, and then you, and then it's not a choice anymore.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, and frankly, it's the way that men are.",,INFO
"Uh, men don't have this choice,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
they don't feel this choice.,,INFO
"Uh, in most subcultures in America that, that I've been exposed to, if the man were to say, uh, no, I've decided not to work, I want to stay home and do the child rearing, my wife has a good job and I want her to keep that, *",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I, I'm going to be the primary caretaker, and, you know, and then, then take care of the children, because we don't want to put them in day care, and this and that. I think most Americans would feel funny about that.",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Maybe sort of feel like he isn't that success that he could have been.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So, it's, um,",,CAT
There's some T V show on now,,INFO
"and I, I think I've seen it once.",,INFO
"I don't get to watch much T V,",,INFO
"but, uh, there's a T V show where the man is the one raising the kids,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and the wife is,",,INFO
"and I,",,CAT
"maybe they based it on that MISTER MOM movie,",,INFO
"but, uh,",,INFO
I didn't happen to see that.,,INFO
"but, uh, there is a T V show out there.",,INFO
I guess they're trying to gain more public acceptance of things like that.,,INFO
Because I know there are cases of where that happens,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"I knew, I knew people who did that years ago,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but they were very apologetic about it,,INFO
"because you could tell they were used to people saying, What are you doing that for, you know.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"It's probably getting more and more accepted today,",,INFO
"in fact it seems like it's kind of like anything goes now,",,INFO
you're not too surprised on much of anything.,,INFO
"When, you know, the husband's the one at home raising the children,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"the mother works,",,INFO
that's not real surprising.,,INFO
"And,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I've seen more and more companies that have, uh, parental leave, not just maternity leave.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"They can have paternity leave, as well as maternity leave.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
In fact I'm pretty sure TI has something like that,,INFO
"because, uh, one of the area supervisors, uh, in my area, as a matter of fact, took off, um, for a couple of weeks, when his wife had their baby.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Now it might have been just to take care of her and the baby,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"instead of having a, you know, a, a nurse, or someone come in, or,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"or something like that, or whatever, mid-wife or whatever they call it that they have for the first couple of weeks.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, I don't know if he took that out of his vacation or if they really do have a paternity,",,INFO
"he put paternity leave up there,",,INFO
"but it might have just been him describing the fact that he was taking vacation days to go be a father for a little while,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
I don't know.,,CAT
"But, I'm not real sure how that goes.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"the other big change I see in, in woman's lives is, um, to remain biological",,INFO
"they, uh, women because they have choice are having children much later in life.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, I mean, my friends who are having children are having them at age thirty.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, if I'd been a couple of generations ago, they would have had kids running around by then.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Well, people they, in general, are just getting married a lot later.",,INFO
I'm still single,,INFO
"so I'm sure I'll be one of those parents that's, you know, one of those women in her thirties when, when I get around to, to ever getting married and having kids.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"That's, uh, I think, I think that's getting a little more common too.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I actually think that I'm, I'm somewhat encouraged by that trend, because after all people live longer lives now,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"so, it's not like, you know, it's not like you're going to, uh, you know, pass away before your child is an adult,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"I mean, barring, you know, unforeseen circumstances.",,INFO
"And, I think, most people make better parents when they are a little bit more mature.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I agree,,CAT
I really do.,,INFO
I agree.,,CAT
"I think it also gives a woman a chance, if she does have a job and a career,",,INFO
it gives the man and the wife both the chance to both be working and maybe save up some money,,INFO
"and then it gives her a little more option if she wants to stay home with the children while they're young,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, be a mother for awhile,",,INFO
and then once they've gotten to school age maybe she could go back to work.,,INFO
"So, she's kind of got that option,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"if, if they wait till later, they've saved up some money,",,INFO
"that it's not as difficult for her to stay at home with the kids and live off one income, or something.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
That's true.,,INFO
"So, I guess, I, I'm pretty encouraged",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I really am.,,INFO
"But, then I'm a product of my generation,",,INFO
"I don't know, if I had been born a hundred years ago and were looking at this time, I might not like it,",,INFO
but it sure seems nice to me.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I mean, I have other things to complain about,",,INFO
"but in terms of, uh, woman's roles,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"um, things really seem a lot more flexible.",,INFO
"I seem to see more women in, uh, in leadership type roles and management positions,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, it's still,",,INFO
"in politics,",,INFO
"it's still a small minority,",,INFO
"but it's,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
but it's an improvement.,,INFO
It really is.,,INFO
Like the Mayor of Dallas is a woman.,,INFO
"Oh, really!",,G_G
"And, I'm sure that twenty years ago that never would have happened,",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"she's, I think, she's in her second term now.",,INFO
"So, she's, she's,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"this is her second term,",,INFO
"I think, she's going to, going to, uh,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
not going to run again after this.,,INFO
"But, but, uh, we do, and we have several council women that are women,",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
you just start hearing more and more.,,INFO
"In fact, oh, the, the Governor of Texas is a woman, too",,INFO
Oh,,CAT
We can't forget that one.,,INFO
"So,",,CAT
"What's, what's her name?",,QUESTION
Ann Richards.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"it,",,CAT
"we don't get much Texas politics out in California, to be honest.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"She was inaugurated in January,",,INFO
"so,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"so, you're starting to see more of that",,INFO
"and I know when I was younger it was all the Presidents, and still all the Presidents are men,",,INFO
"but I'm sure that one of these days, well look at Ferraro ran for Vice-President,",,INFO
That's right,,CAT
"and I guess one of these days, we'll, we'll eventually have,",,INFO
"although during, during the Presidential debates, there was some really nasty patronizing,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"stuff toward,",,INFO
"I don't know if you saw those,",,INFO
"but, I thought she was treated badly for being a woman,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"frankly, I really did by, by, uh, the the then vice-presidential candidates,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, who really, I thought, had a demeaning attitude towards her.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, it was sort of, it was acceptable to say certain types of things to her that she couldn't say back,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that kind of thing, which, I, I, I found myself getting quite enraged about.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, really, that's a previous generation.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I don't,",,CAT
"it's harder to imagine people of our age doing that,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and not feeling really stupid.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Right,,CAT
I agree.,,INFO
"Well, I think we've, we've gotten our five minutes",,INFO
"or,",,CAT
"Well, they've gotten their five minutes worth of us.",,INFO
I've enjoyed talking with you.,,G_G
"It was nice talking to you, too.",,G_G
"Okay,",,G_G
take care.,,G_G
"You, too.",,G_G
"Bye, bye.",,G_G
"Bye, bye.",,G_G
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"Well, are you a fisher person, are you?",,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
I love to fish.,,INFO
Great.,,G_G
What kind of fishing do you do?,,QUESTION
"Well, it's mostly from the rivers and lakes.",,INFO
In California?,,QUESTION
"And, yes,",,CAT
and from the banks.,,INFO
I don't like to go out on boats.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Well, what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods?",,QUESTION
"Well, it, uh,",,CAT
"down here we usually catch catfish and bass, stripped bass, you know, where I fish.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And trout up at, uh, Lake Shasta when I go up there.",,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
"But, I like it all except, uh, really I don't, I don't really care that much for the trout.",,INFO
I think I had rather have a catfish than I would a trout,,INFO
"Well, I, I don't blame you.",,INFO
"I grew up in Nebraska and, uh, grew up fish, cat fishing in the Little Blue River",,INFO
"and then, uh, we moved to, uh, South Dakota",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, did a lot of Walleye fishing on the Missouri River",,INFO
"and, uh, now that we are down here, I think a lot of people do some, uh, bass fishing and strip bass fishing",,INFO
"but, uh, I still, uh, I am sort of a catfish man at heart.",,INFO
"See. Well, uh, like in, uh, Iowa and Nebraska, those little bullheads, they look just like catfish, huh?",,QUESTION
Yep.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
they do.,,INFO
You know that's what I mean cause I am from Iowa.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And, uh, you know, we use to catch those little bullheads",,INFO
"and that's,",,CAT
they look just like baby catfish.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, uh, did you get to go fishing very often?",,QUESTION
Oh yeah.,,CAT
I like to fish.,,INFO
The only problem is I just moved to Texas,,INFO
so it's been a little over a year now,,INFO
"but, uh",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I, I am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here",,INFO
"and I, so really I haven't gone fishing for about two years now",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and it's driving me crazy,,INFO
"but, uh, one of these days, I will go over to, uh, Lake Lewisville or, uh, what is it, uh Ray Hubbard, Lake Ray Hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Well, uh, you like to eat them after you catch them?",,QUESTION
.,,CAT
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
sure.,,INFO
"Because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing,",,INFO
but they don't like to eat them.,,INFO
"Well mo-,",,CAT
You know.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Most of the time, uh, if we catch something, we'll take it home and eat it.",,INFO
"Uh, and you're right.",,CAT
I mean I like to fish for trout,,INFO
"and they are really, uh, uh, good fighters",,INFO
"but, uh, if I went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing I would order if I had a choice of fish on the menu.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I know.,,G_G
"If I go to a restaurant and order fish, it's usually either salmon or, uh, red snapper.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You know,,CAT
"Well, uh, so, do you just, uh, uh, skin your catfish",,QUESTION
"or do you fillet them out,",,QUESTION
"how do you, how do you,",,QUESTION
"We, uh, skin them.",,INFO
Do you?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
Just cut their heads off and skin them,,INFO
"and then I just, uh, flour them, salt and pepper them and cook them.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I don't put that corn meal on them.,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"You know, uh, that's the way my mother taught me to fry them",,INFO
so,,CAT
"Well, that's how we do it too.",,INFO
"Uh, although we, uh, use to set some, uh, trout lines out",,INFO
"and we've caught, you know, fourteen, fifteen pound catfish",,INFO
"and sometimes those are good to, uh, do on a barbecue grill",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and just leave the skin on and, uh, do it with, uh, butter on, uh, on, on tin foil",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and then the skin just basically scrapes right off,,INFO
"and, uh, wer-,",,CAT
and it really tastes pretty good.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well you know, I don't think I've ever tried cooking those, uh, catfish quite that big.",,INFO
"There, uh,",,CAT
"Uh, most of them are just the small, you know, pan frying ones.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, uh,",,CAT
"Well, I am hoping one of these days I'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on, uh, a rod and reel",,INFO
"but, uh",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"so far it's just been on, uh, on the trout lines",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
Wouldn't that be something?,,QUESTION
.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"It's a thrill when you get a big fish though, isn't it?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
You know.,,CAT
"And, uh, well up in, uh, South Dakota on the, in the Missouri River there we've, uh, tied into a few northern pike",,INFO
"and, uh, they really, uh,",,CAT
"in, in,",,CAT
"when the water is cold, they are very slow moving fish,",,INFO
"but in the summer time, they'll, uh, give you a run for your money.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So when you were,",,INFO
when you did go fishing where did you go?,,QUESTION
You moved there from where?,,QUESTION
Nebraska?,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, it was just like the rivers and, uh, the",,QUESTION
"In,",,QUESTION
"lakes I suppose, huh?",,INFO
In Nebraska?,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, yeah.",,CAT
"Most of the time, uh, we just fished, uh, in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that, that we could fish in.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And a lot of them ended up being close to the river,",,INFO
"so if the river every, uh, flooded, you know, then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and so we would do a lot of fishing there too,,INFO
"but, uh, South Dakota didn't really have much for,",,INFO
,,
"Well I grew up out in the country and, uh, was used to having, uh, guns around the place",,INFO
"and, uh,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I'm, uh, not for gun control,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"in the strictest sense of the, uh, word.",,INFO
"I, I think I'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, I have quite a collection myself",,INFO
"and, you know, I'm a good hunter",,INFO
and I started hunting when I was twelve years old.,,INFO
"Of course, my parents made me take hunters safety classes",,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, I don't want to see them ban guns completely",,INFO
but I don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well I, I feel that its, uh,",,INFO
"I think the what was National Rifle Association, uh, had this bumper sticker a few years back if, uh, about if you outlaw guns,",,INFO
only outlaws will have guns then.,,INFO
I believe that.,,G_G
"And I believe that too because the person that is wanting to,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gum, a gu-, a gun, a knife, a, a rock,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"a stick, whatever it is, to commit a crime with,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns, uh,",,INFO
we can handle it,,INFO
but there's an element that can't.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"and it's, you know, it's got to the point now where even our, our police departments and our D E A agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons",,INFO
"because everybody that's in drug trafet-, trafficking has got them.",,INFO
They have got them outgunned.,,INFO
You know. Yeah.,,CAT
So.,,CAT
"There was a an article in the paper just this week where I think it's, uh, one of the gun companies, I can't remember which, was developing a ten metal, ten millimeter automatic pistol for the F B I",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
which would give them additional firepower.,,INFO
"It had, held like a fifteen shot clip,",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"which, uh, would be able, th-, they would be able to put down anything that came at them,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that would be,",,CAT
"but you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun, uh,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's,",,CAT
"a thirty-eight, uh,",,INFO
Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good.,,INFO
No,,CAT
it's sure not.,,CAT
Huh-uh.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I have lived in, uh, Illinois at one time",,INFO
"and they, they passed a, uh, it wasn't really gun control",,INFO
"but it was, you had to register as a gun owner,",,INFO
"you didn't have to list your guns,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"but you had to have this card,",,INFO
it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"and that was the first, uh,",,INFO
this was twenty years ago.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
But they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect.,,INFO
"See in California they,",,INFO
Pardon?,,CAT
In California they make you register when you buy ammunition.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You have to sign a, you know,",,INFO
"they take your name and driver's license number, hunter, hunting license number and all that good stuff,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
before you can buy any big ammunition.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Especially for handguns,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"now rifles aren't too bad,",,INFO
"but, you know, any kind of handgun at all,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you would still have to buy it,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"or sign up for it,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
We lived in Tennessee for awhile,,INFO
and I bought a pistol there,,INFO
and there was a fifteen day waiting period.,,INFO
"You had to fill out an application and,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Gee.,,G_G
then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing.,,INFO
"Gee, that's not a bad idea.",,G_G
"No,",,CAT
"I think that, uh, you know, a, a waiting period, uh,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
can make a difference,,INFO
but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah,,CAT
it is.,,CAT
"So there's, I don't,",,INFO
No.,,CAT
"think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because,",,INFO
"Th-, the only way they could do it I think, would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"You know, I think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit, course, i-,",,INFO
"I, I feel kind of weird about that anyway,",,INFO
"I think if somebody shoots somebody, they ought to be shot.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I'm,",,CAT
So.,,CAT
"We, we're getting into capital punishment now",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"but, you know.",,CAT
"But I, I agree with you there that, uh,",,CAT
It would definitely be gun control,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"The, uh, the, again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
is what the purpose should be.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose, legal purpose",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And I'm in favor of keeping the, the illegal guy from getting one in his hands",,INFO
"but,",,INFO
Myself.,,CAT
the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well and the-, they're actually a necessity in life, you know.",,INFO
Oh yes.,,CAT
"They're not, you know,",,CAT
not everybody needs a gun,,CAT
but sooner or later I need one.,,INFO
"You know, whether I'm out hunting or you know,",,INFO
"I'm never had to protect my life or,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"well I did in the service but not, you know, not on the street",,INFO
"so I don't really need one in the, in the aspects ,",,INFO
"You don't have to carry one in your car or your, uh,",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
huh-uh.,,CAT
or your pocket all the time.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
No.,,CAT
"So mine are, you know, I use mine for recreation,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I don't,",,INFO
and I enjoyed my guns.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I have a good time with them,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Well I know what, uh,",,CAT
"I took my kids out and taught them out, how to shoot a gun.",,INFO
"My wife the same thing, uh, she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have no-, not that I have an arsenal or anything,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
but we have several guns around the house,,INFO
one of these days my grandkids probably.,,INFO
Probably.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"But I think it's, uh,",,CAT
"you got to have, have the pl-,",,INFO
living in Dallas there's not that many places to go shoot,,INFO
"but,",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
huh-uh.,,CAT
"uh, still I think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that when, it's not like on T V when someone gets shot, uh, they get back up.",,INFO
"If someone gets shot with a,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
real gun they don't get back up.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I had to explain that to my,",,INFO
I've got a six year old now,,INFO
"and he, you know,",,CAT
"I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old, well",,INFO
they understand now.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You know I've taken time to teach them,,INFO
and now the young boy wants to know,,INFO
"and, you know, like I told him, you're a little bit young for a gun. Let me go out here and, you know, we would start with the B B gun deal, you know,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
so he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows,,INFO
"and I took it away from him,",,INFO
"I said now,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"you know, so he's learning the hard way",,INFO
but at least it was a B B gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"I remember I had an old uncle up by Tulsa, Oklahoma that took me out and, uh, showed me.",,INFO
"This was, it was not my, it was my mother's uncle,",,INFO
"this was a gentleman in his sixties,",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"and he took me out with him and, uh, single shot twenty-two,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and taught me how to shoot.,,INFO
We went squirrel hunting,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
All right.,,CAT
"and, uh, he taught me how to shoot, uh, a old single shot twenty-two",,INFO
"and, I was probably about twelve at the time,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I thought that was the neatest thing,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"of course Uncle Sam took me out, took me hunting with him",,INFO
and he let me shoot and showed me how.,,INFO
All right.,,CAT
I think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"You know, I don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Well that's about all I,",,INFO
we agreed pretty well on this I think.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think so.,,CAT
Okay.,,G_G
Well it's been real nice talking with you.,,G_G
"All right,",,G_G
have a good one.,,G_G

"Well, the weather has been, certainly has been hot",,INFO
and it's been humid.,,INFO
"I don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high for, uh, this late into, uh,",,INFO
"well, it's not really late into the summer,",,INFO
"but the, the humidity has hung around all of June.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Are you native to this area?,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"I grew up in Michigan,",,INFO
"so, uh, *",,CAT
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"But I've been, I've been in Texas for fifteen years. *",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, uh, but, you know, I know the summers get hot",,INFO
but,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"it certainly, uh,",,INFO
this humidity has just really hung on there.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it seemed like, well, you know, last year was so strange having all those heavy, heavy rains in April",,INFO
and this year we really didn't have heavy rains until May.,,INFO
Kind of like pushed the season back a little farther,,INFO
and now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity,,INFO
"and it just tried to rain,",,INFO
"I mean, I was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago",,INFO
and it was trying to rain which,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
seems strange to have it raining in July.,,INFO
"Normally we don't have too much, uh, humidity or, or, uh, rainy time when it's past June.",,INFO
"Oh, that's right,",,CAT
that's right.,,CAT
"I can remember it not,",,INFO
it's really August that it happens.,,INFO
You get those great big cracks in the ground where it's been so dry,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and it just gets so dry,,INFO
"and, the earth opens up.",,INFO
I can remember the first year I moved here,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it didn't rain,",,INFO
I moved here like in late August,,INFO
and it didn't rain from August until December,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
.,,CAT
I went home and told it just doesn't rain in Texas.,,INFO
"I mean it was great after growing up in Michigan and not, and al-, you know, every day was cloudy,",,INFO
almost every day was cloudy,,INFO
"and I, you sort of forget how much it did rain",,INFO
"and coming here and then it didn't rain,",,INFO
it was just wonderful.,,INFO
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
"see I, I lived in, uh, Ohio mainly.",,INFO
"I lived in, uh, Pontiac just a little while before I came",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
down here,,INFO
"and, you know, so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities, you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather.",,INFO
It might rain on your little parade.,,INFO
"That's right,",,CAT
that's right.,,CAT
"You know, and here it was like, pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime",,INFO
and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do.,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
What part of Michigan were you living in?,,QUESTION
"Oh, I grew up in Dearborn",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"which is a suburb of, of Detroit.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"You probably know where that is because I know where Pontiac is,",,INFO
"so, uh, *",,CAT
.,,CAT
"Anyway,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
What brought you down here?,,QUESTION
"Oh, a teaching job.",,INFO
So you teach in Plano schools?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I did, I did for a while,",,INFO
uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, I'm home with, home with two children,",,INFO
"so, uh, *",,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
"So,",,INFO
Okay,,CAT
New career.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
New career,,INFO
"but, uh, anyway,",,CAT
"so that kind of, uh,",,CAT
"well, I had been down here to visit",,INFO
"so I school and said hey, let's, you know, find a place that has a nice job",,INFO
"and, uh, that's how it worked out.",,INFO
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
"I think a lot of people were, uh, leaving Michigan all about the time I came here in the early eighties",,INFO
and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"You know, the, the little joke about, will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light",,INFO
"Oh, well, it's a nice place, you know,",,INFO
"I mean it's, it's a nice, that's a nice place, though.",,INFO
"Well, you know, I, I said I lived in, uh, the Pontiac.",,INFO
"I didn't live in the city of Pontiac,",,INFO
I lived to the west of it.,,INFO
"Uh, I forget the, the county,",,INFO
but you know where all the lakes are around there.,,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
sort of.,,CAT
I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes.,,INFO
It was real close to where I worked.,,INFO
It was only like four miles to work,,INFO
and it was wonderful being on the lake like that.,,INFO
"You know, in the summer, you feel like you're, you know, on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake",,INFO
"and everybody's, you know, out enjoying the water and such,",,INFO
"and, uh, in the winter time the lakes froze over,",,INFO
you could still kind of go sledding and such out there,,INFO
but I thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes.,,INFO
There's lots of really small ones out there.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, like maybe a mile, two long.",,INFO
Yeah.,,INFO
"That's enough to, uh, do some boating",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
and it was lots of fun.,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"Lake, I think Lake Whitmore is the only one I have real memories of. *",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"Which is,",,INFO
"well, I think it's, I think it's toward Ann Arbor,",,INFO
"so it's probably out in that direction,",,INFO
but that's the only one I probably could name,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
after all these years,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh,",,INFO
"But it was, yeah, just lots of little lakes",,INFO
"and, of course, it was, you know, a little more expensive to live on the lake,",,INFO
but I just thought that was grand.,,INFO
"And I think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them,",,INFO
but there was quite a few lakes all around there.,,INFO
"It seemed like, it was almost like you were living on an island",,INFO
there was so much water around where I was.,,INFO
"I said I wasn't close to downtown Pontiac,",,INFO
"I was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from, from the city limits",,INFO
and it was really nice out there.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"We had, uh, Pine Knob",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"you know, to go skiing",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and stuff.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
So there were things around there.,,INFO
Really was pretty nice.,,INFO
"Sure,",,G_G
"sure,",,G_G
"and d-, isn't that where they have a summer music festival there, too?",,QUESTION
"Right,",,CAT
right,,CAT
in the summertime they have musicals there,,INFO
and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope.,,INFO
"That's right,",,CAT
that's right.,,CAT
"I know, we used to,",,CAT
"we, we didn't do a lot of it,",,INFO
but we did.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"We did,",,INFO
so those are always fun.,,INFO
"And Alpine, was it Alpine was another ski slope",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that we went to,",,INFO
"so, uh, *",,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
It was nice.,,INFO
"I always tell people that in the winter we use, we used to, uh,",,INFO
"my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on, you know, make a pond in the backyard for us.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"So but, uh, you know, we probably did some ice skating on it,",,INFO
"but then it chipped, chipped",,CAT
"and, you know, it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
We used to have a,,INFO
"Christmas time, uh, some of our relatives would come up from Alabama,",,INFO
and I think most times we would have snow around Christmas,,INFO
and the kids when they were young would just go nuts.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, because they were from Alabama where it never snowed",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it, you know, eternally.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Oh, right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"If only it would make nice snow here in Texas, we'd be okay at Christmas time.",,INFO
"My first winter here,",,INFO
"I, I came down in, uh, early eighty-two",,INFO
"and there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December be-, couple days before Christmas.",,INFO
"It lasted only a few hours,",,INFO
like,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
by noon it was gone.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And I remember getting up and somebody telling me, hey, better wait to go to work because the roads are all, you know, snow",,INFO
"And I was laughing, going yeah, right, that's a good practical joke,",,INFO
ha ha.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"They said, no really, there's snow",,INFO
"and there was, but a very short time",,INFO
and the weather got warm so quick,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
it just melted it all away.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
I know.,,CAT
"Course, when we get an ice storm, that's not too much fun.",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"that's not fun either,",,INFO
"so, uh, I, I just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
.,,CAT
"But, uh, well we have,",,INFO
"our house is kind of on a little hill,",,INFO
"so, uh, we get the sled out",,INFO
"and, uh, the kids go down the hi-, the hill on the sleds when it's icy,",,INFO
I mean they just go down the ice.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And if it's cold, we say, okay, out you go.",,INFO
.,,CAT
I think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"I think it's fun,",,INFO
even the couple of ice storms I've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit.,,INFO
"I mean, sometimes the ice is pretty bad,",,INFO
"but if you get on the, the, uh, grassy kind of part, you get a little bit of traction, you know, not slip and fall.",,INFO
"I mean, first,",,CAT
,,
Okay.,,CAT
What do you think about it?,,QUESTION
"Uh, well, immigration,",,INFO
"I know they're really strict right now because my hundr-, husband is from out of the country",,INFO
"and, uh, we had to go through a whole, very long process to, uh, to, assure the government that he was, uh, marrying me",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and not to be a resident here.,,INFO
"That's interest-,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"I think that's, uh, I think it's a little crazy.",,INFO
I worked with Spanish people,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
for about two years,,INFO
"and just, it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"I mean, you can't just come over to the country because, uh, you want to.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"You know, that's not good enough.",,INFO
"You have to have a, have to have a darn good reason of, political or whatever.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
"Not a good, not a good easy way to get in.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think, you know, I think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to, to protect, you know, the people who are in the states.",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
"My mother, uh, actually knew a woman in another state that used to marry men",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"just,",,INFO
"n-, she'd never even meet them",,INFO
and she'd just get money for it.,,INFO
"Oh, you're kidding.",,QUESTION
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"So, uh,",,CAT
.,,CAT
.,,CAT
Sounds like a lot of fun.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it's amazing to me how, how many things they would allow to occur before, you know, you can come in.",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
"But, I mean, with the new laws, it's",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
it's tough now.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it's kind of frustrating, too, for those who are legitimate now.",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
"You know, I think,",,CAT
"Well, and, you know, uh, my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they got here,",,INFO
"but now it's a, you know, it's so strict that you can't just do that.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
"And I think it's important that they, you know, they allow a good number of people in every year",,INFO
"because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that, that we don't want to do.",,INFO
I agree.,,CAT
"And I just,",,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"I have, personally I have a problem with it,",,INFO
"I think, that, you know, if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
we shouldn't close our door.,,INFO
"If they're not going to be on welfare or, or, or whatever.",,INFO
They're going to be a productive citizen Zen.,,INFO
"And, you know, I, I believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when, you, you know, send them back to their country.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, I think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Well, think of how many illegal aliens have, have, have been, uh, uh, sent back to Mexico just to find their way back.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and that's, that's what I think.",,INFO
"You know, I, I have to laugh",,INFO
"because, like I said, I worked with a lot of those",,INFO
and they'd been deported two or three times,,INFO
and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for Christmas.,,INFO
"That's right,",,INFO
that's our money.,,INFO
Or for any other time.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
that's true.,,INFO
"But, I think, you know, I think all in all there's a lot of improvements.",,INFO
I think the general idea is good,,INFO
"but, but there could be some work done in the area.",,INFO
"I, I think",,CAT
"I, I agree.",,CAT
Well good,,G_G
.,,CAT
"Anyway, do you have anything else in the, the subject, uh",,QUESTION
"Uh, I, uh,",,CAT
boy,,G_G
that you might want to talk about?,,INFO
"this is spur of the moment, uh,",,CAT
"but, I, I don't really see any, any changes that I think of really blatant right now",,INFO
"other than I think they ought to take, you know, on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a, uh, political refugee.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
absolutely.,,CAT
"I think a lot of times we take, you know, basically who we want to",,INFO
"because if you, if you have connections, it's a lot easier to get in.",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
Connections and money.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and I think, you know, it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And that it should be equal to all,,INFO
"and then not like the United States,",,INFO
"basically, it's not who you know,",,INFO
"it d-, it doesn't become a thing of who you know, but, but how the type of person you are.",,INFO
I agree.,,CAT
"And it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people, like probably your husband, can get in",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"Well, we got him past that,",,INFO
"but, uh,",,CAT
"Well, great.",,G_G
"I know there's a lot of other people out there,",,INFO
.,,CAT
would probably do a good job here.,,INFO
Yep.,,CAT
"Well, let's see,",,CAT
is there anything I believe in,,QUESTION
I think that's it.,,INFO
Is this like a very short call?,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"I'm not sure how long they're supposed to be,",,INFO
"but, I've enjoyed it.",,INFO
"It's good hearing your, your point of view",,INFO
and I think that's neat.,,INFO
I think we agree a lot on that,,INFO
and,,INFO
"I did, too.",,CAT
I've learned something from it.,,INFO
"Well, it was nice talking to you.",,G_G
"Well, thanks,",,G_G
I'm glad you're home.,,G_G
"You have a good evening, all right?",,G_G
"You, too.",,G_G
"Thanks,",,G_G
bye-bye.,,G_G
Bye.,,G_G
,,
"I don't,",,CAT
"guess we got our first, uh, credit card, oh, back in the seventies, early seventies when,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I first got married,,INFO
"was a Visa card. Uh, issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City,",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
.,,CAT
"because my sister worked at the, uh, the Visa some Bank Americard center there. *",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, we were still in college",,INFO
and had she not worked there I'm not sure that I would have qualified.,,INFO
.,,CAT
They've come in handy over the years.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, and they have become, or, also a, a real bother sometimes.",,INFO
"Oh, tell me about it",,G_G
"Especially, you know, if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
it's just easier to put everything on a card.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, I find if you're not careful you wind up, uh, a month or so, staring those bills in the face",,INFO
and you go I don't remember doing all that stuff,,INFO
and it adds up.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
they add up quick,,INFO
"So, sometimes, uh, especially traveling with T I,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, everything goes on American Express,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, as far as personal life goes, I guess, I really try to use them as little as possible, uh,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"I kind of like having them for, uh, gasoline purchases.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies, you know.",,INFO
"But,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"But other than that, uh, I, I guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
of just putting everything on there day after day after day,,INFO
"and then,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"then you really get socked to it, if you don't watch it.",,INFO
"How, how do you look at counting credit cards?",,QUESTION
"We just, uh, quit using them",,INFO
"Well, that's,",,CAT
"And they got us in trouble,",,INFO
we took a loan and paid them all off.,,INFO
"We keep them, uh, we keep, uh, one gas card and, uh, and, uh, Visa just, you know, in case there's an emergency or,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
something,,INFO
but other than that we don't use them anymore,,INFO
"Well, that's kind of the way we were doing",,INFO
"it's, uh,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I guess for that very reason that, that, uh, if you're not real conscious of what you're doing,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"it's just too much by the time you get,",,INFO
"well, if you got a bunch of cards,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
you get a bunch of bills every month,,INFO
and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid.,,INFO
"I know,",,CAT
isn't that funny?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"And I give them,",,CAT
"maybe not, maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid",,INFO
"because they're,",,CAT
"know if you don't,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"then they're adding on, what, eighteen, nineteen, twenty percent.",,INFO
"Sometimes,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
it's twenty-two percent interest.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and then some of them add late fees on it,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
if they don't get paid,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"I guess that's one of the motivations behind the,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"the, uh,",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"the, uh, American Express card with T I,",,INFO
"there's no,",,CAT
Huh?,,CAT
"with the American Express card from T I,",,INFO
Uh-huh .,,CAT
"there's no, um, late fee,",,INFO
"there's no, uh, interest rate,",,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
"you ei-, you either pay the thing off",,INFO
or they come get it.,,INFO
.,,CAT
And it's turned into personnel,,INFO
and they come get you,,INFO
.,,CAT
"So, they've got quite a bit more motivation I think to get paid then,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
some of the others do.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT

Can you use that one for personal use? *,,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT

Yeah.,,CAT
"So, yo-, uh, you want to make sure that, uh, is that okay,",,INFO
"is that o-, okay, that those people see what it is that you are buying,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and most of the time it is.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"But, most of the others I've sent back, I mean, all you get is card offers, *",,INFO
"I've got three card offers now,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, from gas companies and, uh, Visa Gold and, uh, some, other bank, uh,",,INFO
Citibank I think is always sending the Visa stuff out.,,INFO
"And I usually just throw them away because I,",,INFO
"Oh, I do too,",,CAT
"I don't even open them much,",,INFO
I throw them out.,,INFO
"I don't want another one,",,INFO
I don't want to have to mess with it.,,INFO
"You know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, one of these days it's going to all be full.",,INFO
"A girlfriend of mine found a,",,INFO
"it was a Visa or MasterCard,",,INFO
"she found an ad for one in like a GOOD HOU-, HOUSEKEEPING magazine for eleven percent.",,INFO
"Oh, that's not bad.",,G_G
shoot I need one of those,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"if they don't say, no annual membership on them, I'll throw them away.",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"years ago, well, th-, I had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for, *",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"oh, probably fifteen years,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and then they started charging, uh, annual membership fees,",,INFO
"and I said, adios, I'm, you know, I'm not paying you,",,INFO
Why do they do that?,,QUESTION
"It's just another way to make money,",,INFO
"I mean,",,INFO
as far as I can tell.,,INFO
"I mean, they've been,",,CAT
"I mean they get enough, you know, on the interest",,INFO
"Well, sure.",,G_G
"And they, I guess, they figure they've got enough people out there with cards,",,INFO
"they're going to get cards at the ,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
twenty bucks a pop.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
There's going to be that much more.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, so, then a couple years ago I found, uh, a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was, you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, I went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account, in his name, and got my Visa card,",,INFO
"so,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"as long as they have no annual membership fee,",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"I, it would be okay,",,INFO
but I can't see paying someone to use their card.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
I can't either.,,CAT
"Be charged their eighteen percent interest,",,INFO
so. *,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,INFO
I think you're right.,,INFO
"The best philosophy is have them if you need them, but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
really.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"gets a lot of people in, in trouble",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
it sure does.,,CAT
"Maybe they're counting on that,",,INFO
I don't know.,,CAT
"Well, I guess that's it.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
Thanks for talking.,,G_G
Nice talking to you.,,G_G
Bye.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
So how do you feel about it?,,QUESTION
"Uh, I, I don't see any problem with, with testing for random drugs.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I, myself, almost, uh, am in favor of it.",,INFO
"Uh, I work at Honeywell",,INFO
"and I went through a, a pretty, I don't know, I went through a, standard drug testing thing before I, I was brought on.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I think that's pretty standard.,,INFO
At least at Honeywell it is.,,INFO
"Uh, I think it's important to insure the quality and, and, uh, I don't know, almost the goodness of character. You know",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
that kind of thing.,,INFO
Where do you work?,,QUESTION
"Uh, well I'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon.",,CAT
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"And I, I just came from Saint Paul.",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"Uh, interviewing with Three M.",,INFO
"Oh, great.",,G_G
"And, uh, they have a policy for, uh, testing.",,INFO
"If you, if they make you an offer, then they'll test you right before you start.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And I guess the only drawback I can see to, to drug testing is in, in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some, uh, sort of false positive result",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
then there could,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
be some sort of problem.,,INFO
"But i-,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"And that, that definitely happens, you know.",,CAT
"I mean those, the drug tests, sure they're accurate",,INFO
but there's always that margin of error.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And that's, that's something to be aware of.",,INFO
"Another thing is, a lot of times, you know, they aren't that accurate.",,INFO
They aren't that sensitive.,,INFO
"Like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind, you know, what are they going to do about that",,QUESTION
Yeah,,CAT
"You know, I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for Honeywell",,INFO
"and, uh, uh, you know, I know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something.",,INFO
"Uh, I'm sure they screen for just a particular few types.",,INFO
Although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this,,INFO
and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, I don't know.",,CAT
"What, what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon?",,QUESTION
"Uh, electrical engineering.",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
Great.,,G_G
"Uh, yeah,",,CAT
I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida. University of Central Florida.,,INFO
"Oh, wow .",,G_G
And this is actually a an internship up here.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"But, uh, they, uh, even for interns they, they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"They test you, uh, before they, before you start or before you even",,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
interview,,INFO
"or,",,CAT
"Uh, they essentially,",,CAT
no,,CAT
"I sure don't uh,",,CAT
"they essentially, uh, they essentially, uh, made me the offer and then, and then, uh, did the drug testing thing after that.",,INFO
"So, uh, it was one of those things where you go through the, the general battery of all their tests",,INFO
"and, and then, they essentially give you the offer",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and then at that point they'll, they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"So, uh, there's some noise on this end.",,INFO
I'm actually in a mall calling,,INFO
so,,CAT
.,,CAT
Oh,,CAT
"You probably wondered, huh.",,QUESTION
"But,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Wh-, what happens if you were to fail?",,QUESTION
"Then do they give you like one ch-, one more chance or two more chances?",,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
That's a good question.,,G_G
"I believe from what I remember of the literature they gave, uh, if you fail I believe they give you one more chance.",,INFO
They probably give you a chance to explain yourself,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and then maybe give you another chance to go through it.,,INFO
"But, uh, you know, once again, those things are not that accurate",,INFO
"so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail, you know.",,INFO
"But, uh, wha-,",,CAT
are you working right now anywhere,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Uh, no.",,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
"I'm just about to finish my Master's in May and, uh",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
Great.,,G_G
just interviewing with companies right now.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening, you know. Was, was going to Honeywell.",,INFO
A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And he's doing an internship with I B M.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And, uh, they, basically, uh, did the same exact thing.",,INFO
"Uh, we both got our internships at the same time",,INFO
and we both had to go through drug testing at the same time.,,INFO
"So, one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process.",,INFO
"But, uh,",,CAT
"Did, do they test you at, right now, at work too?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
no.,,CAT
That's,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"one thing they don't do is, is drug testing while you're on the job.",,INFO
"Uh, I think, I think the unwritten rule is, yeah, expect it",,INFO
but they don't do it.,,INFO
Oh,,CAT
"You know, so. That's good I guess.",,INFO
I don't know.,,CAT
"I mean, I, uh, I have gone to a couple of parties since, since that time",,INFO
"and while I don't do any drugs myself, I've seen some people who work there, uh, you know, smoking a joint or whatever.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, you know, that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up, you know.",,INFO
"But no,",,CAT
"they don't, they don't really do that.",,INFO
So.,,CAT
Wow.,,G_G
Is it formal policy that they said they might test?,,QUESTION
Yeah,,CAT
,,
"So, the topic is vacations?",,QUESTION
"Alright,",,CAT

it is.,,INFO

Down by Big Bend?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter,",,INFO

Yeah.,,CAT

So what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America today?,,QUESTION
"Well, I think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the, or a lot less of the,",,INFO
.,,CAT
time than they're,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"given by the court system,",,INFO
"but, I don't know,",,CAT
"with the economy the way it is, I think crime can't do much but go up.",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"I have to, I have to agree with you.",,INFO
"I had occasion a couple years ago to hear the r-, s-, Chief of Police of Richardson, Texas speak",,INFO
"and, you know, it's a shame a, a criminal today, not a murderer, but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things and, you know, he does this and he does this for a couple of years, hides all the stash and works off of it",,INFO
"and then when he gets caught, he'll be sentenced to something like five to seven years,",,INFO
but he gets five days credit for every day he serves.,,INFO
"I mean, it's like a bonus to go to jail.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"subsequently, a five year sentence means he's going to be out in, uh, a year on probation.",,INFO
"I mean, what he does, the chief said is he just merely goes back to his, his stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate",,INFO
"and, uh, when he s-, uses up all that and spends all that money, then he, uh, starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing.",,INFO
"Well, there was an article in our paper Sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in North Carolina, the average serves six weeks",,INFO
"Now, see, that's a, you talk about, that's a crime right there.",,INFO
"Well, see, we don't have any room in our prisons",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Well, we don't either, in Texas.",,INFO
"They shu-, they shuttle them in and shuttle them out",,INFO
"and they get them, get them early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks",,INFO
"and then they're, they're paroled, uh, to make room for the newest criminals",,INFO
"and it just, it, it's just really absurd.",,INFO
"Well, it, it certainly is,",,CAT
"and, uh, that would be a huge concern.",,INFO
"You know, I don't think the general public really realizes this as far as what goes on with our criminal system, our judiciary system and everything else.",,INFO
"It's just, uh, it's terrible the way it is right now.",,INFO
"I think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now, so many different things coming in so many different directions that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize there's abs-,",,INFO
or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"as far as steps to reduce crime, if it's, uh, crimes like we're just been discussing, obviously we, we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"to, uh, take them off the streets,",,INFO
"but I don't think that's going to happen because, just like you said,",,INFO
"and our state's a good example,",,INFO
your state's a good example,,INFO
"and, it's just not going to happen.",,INFO
"As far as the murderers, and people that commit rape and things like that, I'm not sure what's right,",,INFO
"but I know it,",,INFO
"it's not right to put them in there and let them live for years and years and leers, w-, years before you do execute them or whatever because it's, has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
clothe him,,INFO
"and, you know, to, I'm sure he gets to watch a lot of T V",,INFO
"and I'm sure they have, uh, exercise facilities and movies",,INFO
"and, and everything else, you know, they can have a good time in.",,INFO
"Well, I don't know what the answer is,",,INFO
but I know that asking the question over and over and over again isn't working,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
it really isn't.,,INFO
"A big,",,CAT
it's a big problem,,INFO
and hopefully something will come out of it.,,INFO
"So, I don't know.",,CAT
"Uh,",,CAT
"I'm, uh",,INFO
I hope so.,,INFO
"I'm pretty much of a hard person,",,INFO

"Oh, I definitely believe in capital",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
punishment.,,INFO
"You bet,",,CAT
"I mean, that's the only way to,",,INFO
"It's when they, it's when they're in, on death row for nineteen years that I don't, I'm kind of c-, curious about.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"and you spend thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars to, uh, take care of them and all, you know,",,INFO
it's just unbelievable.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
you can appeal now in North Carolina for almost a period of twenty years.,,INFO
Can you really?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go round until you,",,INFO
"I think the, I think it's, uh, the average is eight to ten years to get in to the North Carolina Supreme Court",,INFO
God.,,G_G
"and then, uh, after that it goes to the Supreme Court of the United States",,INFO
and that usually takes another four to six years.,,INFO
"Oh, I know.",,CAT
So it's,,CAT
"Meanwhile, you're living in a country club situation perhaps, you know.",,INFO
"They're hoping,",,INFO
"I guess they're, what they're h-, they're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"But it's just a,",,INFO
we have a serious problem.,,INFO
We have so many problems in this state now,,INFO
"and, and the, the thing is the, the thing,",,CAT
"The drug problem, that's another one.",,INFO
"The fundamental problem is the, is,",,INFO
,,
"Okay, uh, I guess, we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I basically read books.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"It is,",,CAT
I do.,,INFO
"Sometimes, when everybody's gone to bed, my kids are in bed and my husband in bed,",,INFO
"so I will just stay up and finish a book that I am,",,INFO
I have about three books that I am going on.,,INFO
"And I will work on one for a little bit, you know, and then the next one.",,INFO
"But that's just kind of,",,CAT
"Well, that is pretty impressive to have three books going.",,INFO
"Not always,",,CAT
just sometimes.,,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
And what what kind of books do you read?,,QUESTION
"Uh, just really different ones.",,INFO
"Uh, I have one that I was reading on, uh, raising your children and then another one on a, an autobiography, and another one on, uh, uh, uh, like a crime story",,INFO
Oh yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
A true crime story.,,INFO
"Oh, do you like those detective stories?",,QUESTION
.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"But this,",,CAT
it was a true one.,,INFO
It was just a little different though.,,INFO
Reading that one last night.,,INFO
"Oh, well that is interesting.",,G_G
"Actually, I like to read also,",,INFO
"but, uh, usually fall into one or two categories, either true science fiction or fantasy on the one hand or highly technical.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
like my husband.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
kind of one or the other.,,INFO
"Uh,",,CAT
"You must, uh, work for T I?",,QUESTION
I do.,,CAT
Yes.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
my husband does too.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
and I am a computer scientist.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, I have a lot of other hobbies.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
really.,,CAT
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
"I am kind of, uh, I guess what you would call it, a project person.",,INFO
"Oh, really.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and I love,",,INFO
like I have a shop,,INFO
"and when things break around the house, I always try to fix them myself",,INFO
"and so, hobby,",,CAT
"it's, it's funny, uh,",,INFO
"from the one stand point, it is work.",,INFO
"But it is a hobby too, that I enjoy",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
to do.,,INFO
"To find broken,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
What kinds of things do you fix?,,QUESTION
"Well, essentially anything you find in a house. Uh, a stove, or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or, uh, chipped tile on the floor. I mean just anything.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
And you have a shop?,,QUESTION
"Well it, it is not anything elaborate.",,CAT
It is just a work bench and a gazillion tools.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, enough that, again for anything in the house I could probably,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
you can fix just about everything and anything.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Well, that is great.",,G_G
"And in the car,",,CAT
I guess the car too.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And so, uh, I think I probably would consider that a hobby.",,INFO
"Although, sometimes it gets to be excessive.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
That is pretty much like my husband.,,INFO
"He is, he is pretty, uh, mobile in that area too.",,INFO
"He, he works on the cars.",,INFO
He rarely takes them in,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"I,",,CAT
"and, uh, he works on irons, and all T V -s and stuff too.",,INFO
We rarely have to take those things in too.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think it, it,",,CAT
"not only can it be fun,",,INFO
but it can certainly help your finances.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
definitely.,,CAT
"So, do you have any art, uh, how do I say it, creative or artistic hobbies?",,QUESTION
Uh. Not really.,,CAT
"I mean during Christmas I work on, you know, like, uh, holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things.",,INFO
"Oh yeah,",,CAT
well that's good.,,G_G
"But, but, uh, not really",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I don't necessarily either.",,INFO
I can plink out a song or two on a piano,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"and I can, uh,",,CAT
"I don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art,",,INFO
I guess,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, graphic arts",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"is that what they call it,",,INFO
"I can't do any of that,",,INFO
but sweat shirts is certainly impressive.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I belong to this organization for, uh, if, if you have preschool children",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, every once and a while they will have a craft, uh, section for the moms",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
and those are really neat,,INFO
"and we learn to do the, uh, transfer pictures on the sweatshirts",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
transfer photos,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, those are really neat.",,INFO
So we learn different crafts like that,,INFO
I see.,,G_G
uh,,INFO
"Well, that is neat",,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
I guess you could consider that a hobby.,,INFO
"Do you, do you cook for a hobby",,QUESTION
"or do you,",,QUESTION
No,,CAT
I cook dinner,,INFO
"That's not something you,",,INFO
I don't consider it a hobby,,INFO
I understand that.,,G_G
"But, uh, you know, I",,CAT
no,,CAT
I am not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I like to bake off and on.,,INFO
"And usually once a week I will bake something,",,INFO
"but it's not anything elaborate, you know",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"At least, I don't think it is.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"But, I think that still borders on hobby.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Probably the other thing I do which I am sure will sound horrible to you, but is I program for fun. Uh, on the computer.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, I have little projects little computer projects going on that I consider hobbies.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, drive my wife crazy.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
Well good.,,G_G
You have a computer at home?,,QUESTION
"I do,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"Oh, good.",,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
"In fact, there is actually several of them here right now.",,INFO
"Oh, really.",,CAT
Not all of them being mine.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
Then you are busy,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
that is very good.,,G_G
"Uh, I wonder if you can construe raising children as being a hobby?",,QUESTION
.,,CAT
"Well, you know one of the books that I did, that I was reading,",,INFO
"and I stopped because it was so,",,INFO
it's,,CAT
the book is so detailed,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and you have to,",,INFO
sometimes I have to go back and read the page over again cause I didn't quite get it all.,,INFO
"And, uh, it is so detailed,",,INFO
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"Uh, let me see",,CAT
I've been sitting here awhile.,,INFO
I almost forgot the topic.,,INFO
"But, uh, it seems like I get most of my news from television.",,INFO
"I'm, we only get the paper on the weekends",,INFO
"and so I'm not much of a, of a paper reader",,INFO
"or but I, I and I'm don't, rarely listen to the, uh, radio",,INFO
"so I get most of my news like from documentaries like FORTY-EIGHT HOURS, TWENTY TWENTY, you know, the news at night.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"News in the afternoon, that kind of thing.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well I get a,",,INFO
.,,CAT
weekend paper as well,,INFO
"and, uh, in addition to that I get a local weekly.",,INFO
"I, I live in suburb of Milwaukee",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they get, they have community newspapers around here so the local, their extremely local stuff",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, is in the local paper that comes out once a week",,INFO
"and then I get the Sunday, uh, MILWAUKEE JOURNAL because I don't have time to read a paper.",,INFO
"Uh, mostly",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
that's my difficulty.,,INFO
"I, uh, I get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do, although I do listen to N P R which has very good, and that's National Public Radio which",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"has very good, uh, coverage of the national and international news, I feel",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and does a pretty good job of analysis as well.,,INFO
Are you in the car quite a bit,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"I'm not actually. Uh,",,INFO
but I can run my radio in my office.,,INFO
"I, I",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
teach at the university,,INFO
and when I'm not,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"teaching, if I choose to have the radio on I can listen to that station,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Oh, I see. Uh,",,CAT
"How are you, are you satisfied with the TWENTY TWENTY and FORTY-EIGHT HOURS and the things that you do watch?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I, I pretty much am",,INFO
and I watch the news at least twice a day.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, uh, if I've missed something and, and I've just recently decided to stay home with my children",,INFO
"and so it seems as if I catch the news ris-, right as it happens, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
There was the explosions and that kind of thing.,,INFO
My husband will say how did you know about that.,,INFO
"Yes,",,INFO
it happened at such and such time,,INFO
"And that's so, that, that's different for me.",,INFO
So I usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing.,,INFO
"Is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is, is the timely yo-, noting of the events as they happen?",,QUESTION
Is that what you feel good about in the news coverage?,,QUESTION
"Uh, no",,CAT
"it just seems like since I've recently stayed home, that is what's happened, you know.",,INFO
"It's just that, uh, now that I've stayed home, I'm, I'm usually aware of when these things occurred",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and it happened,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Well, I, myself, uh, th-, the reason why I listen to N P R and the reason why I watch MACNEIL LEHRER,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"rather than the, than the network news shows at night, although I do o-, watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"uh, is that quite often it seems to me the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis.",,INFO
.,,CAT
The local doesn't either,,INFO
"but I feel that MACNEIL LEHRER get a little more deeply into some, some of the issues that are really current.",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
*,,CAT
And perhaps newspapers do that,,INFO
"but as I said, I don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper",,INFO
and frankly when I have read a newspaper,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I haven't noticed that kind of analysis either.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"So. Uh, there's, there is some danger to that, of course, too.",,INFO
"Because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then, you know, how good is it.",,QUESTION
"But, uh, I like a little more indepth coverage",,INFO
"and I think that's what you're, maybe appealing to you too on something like TWENTY TWENTY or",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
FORTY-EIGHT HOURS.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
It kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That kind of thing.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"So. Uh,",,CAT
I'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"rather than simply being aware that, you know, there, that an event has occurred",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture.",,INFO
Maybe because I'm easily confused by detail.,,INFO
I don't know,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
I know what you're saying.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
So.,,CAT
But I try and catch most of those programs on Wednesday's and Friday's,,INFO
"and if I miss them, I try you know, I try and, and tape them if I'm out that kind of thing,",,INFO
I try and tape them,,INFO
and so I can sit back and watch them.,,INFO
And it's pretty interesting.,,INFO
"When,",,CAT
"you have young children, right?",,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the T V set for awhile without interruption.,,QUESTION
"Well, yeah.",,CAT
"Plus, I find that I have to video tape quite a bit of things",,INFO
"Oh, you do?",,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"If I don't want any interruptions, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That kind of thing.,,CAT
When is your good watching time?,,QUESTION
"Uh, it seems like ten o'clock at night",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Yes.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's what,",,CAT
"Unfortunately,",,INFO
"but that, that's what it seems like, ten o'clock at night.",,INFO
I have older children,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
and getting dinner on the table.,,INFO
I come from the east coast,,INFO
"and I was,",,CAT
"it amazed me when I got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time, they still watch the news when,",,INFO
,,
I know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now.,,INFO
I've lost track.,,INFO
I don't really know.,,INFO
"I, I do have some opinions,",,INFO
but go ahead.,,COMMAND
"Yeah,",,CAT
"um, well I know that they're, they're real cautious about letting Middle Eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism.",,INFO
"What,",,QUESTION
"Uh,",,CAT
What?,,INFO
"okay ,",,INFO
"I hadn't thought about that, uh.",,INFO
What all do you know about it?,,INFO
"Uh, well I just have an opinion,",,INFO
"now I didn't think, I thought the terrorism thing was overstated, I mean,",,INFO
.,,CAT
there was nothing over here.,,INFO
"In fact even,",,CAT
"this is not our subject, I guess,",,INFO
"but, uh, maybe it is or isn't, I suppose.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
My wife when she talked about the Middle East,,INFO
"and everyone's afraid, you know, of how the war was going to go and everything,",,INFO
"I said, I told her, no,",,INFO
it's just not going to happen.,,INFO
"There's not going to be any terrorism over him,",,INFO
"and there wasn't, you know.",,INFO
"They just didn't have an organization,",,INFO
"but, uh, I, I, I'm concerned that we're letting too many, that we don't have enough controls.",,INFO
"I think that, uh, the Asian gangsters that we've let in here",,INFO
and if,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and the guys from, uh, Cuba, you know, there's a lot of criminals down in Florida that we've let in from Cuba that Fidel pushed off on us,",,INFO
"and, uh, and the last, you know,",,CAT
"out of all the Asians we brought in, there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from, from Asia",,INFO
and I think that,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
there's got to be some sort of controls over that.,,INFO
I mean this Asia mafia thing is getting out of hand.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I don't, I don't, I didn't know what, I don't even know what our controls are.",,INFO
"I don't even know what, uh, if we have any guidelines at all, uh, on immigration.",,INFO
"Um, I always thought that we did,",,INFO
"but I don't, I don't, I don't know what they are right now.",,INFO
"There, I don't think there's much of, much of one, because I'm sure all the people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, most of them, it's just like Australia, most of them were criminals from Cuba",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and I think that was just an attempt that, that Fidel Castro to undermine, you know",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"The, *",,CAT
the United States to some extent.,,INFO
So he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us.,,INFO
Yeah. *,,CAT
"And it's almost the same thing in, in, uh, from Asia, because",,INFO
"Because we,",,INFO
"a lot, a lot of them was put out of business in Vietnam after the war,",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"I, I do have some sympathy with, uh, you know,",,INFO
"of course we have this big Mexican problem,",,INFO
"not a problem,",,INFO
"but I think that we need to do something with, uh, the immigration of back and a-, forth across Mexico, uh",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I, I'm sympathetic,",,INFO
"I don't know what the answer is, I guess.",,INFO
"I'm sympathetic certainly with that, that, that they want to come over here",,INFO
"and they, I guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work.",,INFO
"And if, if they have jobs, you know, I hear the story that they're taking away American jobs.",,INFO
"But I don't know, uh,",,CAT
I don't know how many American jobs they are really taking away.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So I, I'm sympathetic,",,INFO
but I don't have an answer.,,INFO
I don't,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, I think that we should have good relations with, with Mexico,",,INFO
but that's not really exactly immigration.,,INFO
It is,,INFO
and it isn't.,,INFO
"I don't know to what degree we owe the people who come across before they're citizens,",,INFO
"owe the children education and all that, uh,",,INFO
"although, the idea of education is an answer to a lot of problems in the world.",,INFO
So,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I guess it's what they,",,INFO
"their, the Mexican kids get a good education along the way,",,INFO
"and maybe that's a benefit to everybody, you know.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
and a lot of the Mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and they have green cards.,,INFO
"And, uh, then, like you said, a lot of,",,INFO
I run into people every day that can't speak English.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"And, uh, and, and most of them, you know, are working in janitorial positions",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"And that,",,CAT
"So, I, I don't know,",,INFO
"like you said, I don't know how much, how much they're taking from the work force, you know.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I never thought that they were much.,,INFO
I do cringe when I hear some of the problems we've had.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, uh, of course you mentioned the language.",,INFO
"I feel so bad that we, here in Texas, or certainly the southern part of the United States, uh, California, Texas, and all that, why our kids don't speak fluid Spanish, uh, by junior high, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"as well as us, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"so that we could, wouldn't have the language barrier certainly.",,INFO
"That, that, that is a shame that we have this tremendous border of Mexico,",,INFO
"and then, in Europe, you know, they speak their French and all",,INFO
"and they try, they go out of their way to try to speak their neighbor's language so they can understand.",,INFO
"We, we cert-, we don't really even make an effort",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"to speak Spanish,",,INFO
and I feel bad about that,,INFO
Go ahead.,,COMMAND
"Well, that's,",,CAT
I,,CAT
yeah,,CAT
"I took Spanish in school,",,INFO
"and that's, you know, one reason that I did it",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"is because, because whenever you travel anywhere near the border, you know, there more and more people speak Spanish.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I guess it's never too late.,,INFO
"I, I do have some Spanish books,",,INFO
"and I've always, uh,",,INFO
"every year I say I'm going to try to speak some newcomers language, you know.",,INFO
I don't know if it's costing us any money,,INFO
"or how much money they're putting into it, uh,",,INFO
"that's always a factor,",,INFO
"I mean how much, my wife says, How much the federal government is putting into it",,INFO
Well,,CAT
immigration.,,INFO
"yeah,",,INFO
"well, it's basically on the, well,",,INFO
"I think it's mostly concentrated toward the borders,",,INFO
"and, uh, it's more, um,",,CAT
"the immigration is tied in with, uh, drug trafficking.",,INFO
"So they have to watch out who comes in,",,INFO
"and, and they're always finding drugs on, you know, on the most, um, innocent looking kind of",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I forgot what they found,",,INFO
"but a dog found it the other day, you know",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
on the border.,,INFO
"Oh yeah,",,CAT
"I, I, I think that certainly is a problem.",,INFO
"I guess our immigration history, that's a great subject.",,INFO
"They, uh, didn't say to talk about that,",,INFO
"but that is, I mean,",,CAT
"on Ellis Island, they,",,INFO
"you know they're redoing that and going to make it a museum, a national museum.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"That certainly was interesting,",,INFO
"since all of us had, uh, ancestors that came over that way.",,INFO
"Or not all,",,INFO
"but I guess, I guess if you go back far enough you came over on a boat originally, you know.",,INFO
"But, uh, a lot of us have parents, grandparents,",,INFO
my grandparents came over in about eighteen ninety or something like that.,,INFO
"And I'm sure they came over, you know, through Ellis Island, you know.",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
Well. *,,CAT
"So we all immigrants, one way or another, well",,INFO
"we certainly are, coming from Europe.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,INFO
"and one of the, one of the things that really gets to me, uh, about the Mexicans is that, um, once they have children over here, their children are American citizens then.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
those were laws are unusual.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
and then they'll ship the parents back,,INFO
and that leaves the children without any parents.,,INFO
"So,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"but I don't understand, whose rule is that, you know. *",,CAT
"And they, you know, and, and they just follow the rule no matter, you know.",,INFO
So that doesn't seem fair to the children.,,INFO
"Yeah, *",,CAT
"sometimes common sense should take over rather than,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
that you would do it that way.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You would think they could at least get a, a, a visa or something until they, uh, get citizenship.",,INFO
I'm sure they want to.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and then they granted them amnesty if they could prove, when was that, it was in the eighties some time",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
if they could prove they'd been here five years.,,INFO
"I heard something about that, yeah.",,INFO
"And, uh, a lot of them had been, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Some of them, some of them moved back and forth,",,INFO
but,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, most of them don't ever want to go back to Mexico,",,INFO
especially,,INFO
Oh no.,,CAT
the way it was then.,,INFO
"Oh, no,",,G_G
"I, I could see, you could see why.",,G_G
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I don't know how much immigration we have from Europe and everything.,,INFO
What the controls are.,,INFO
"I think most, you know, like especially the celebrities and everything, they just have a, uh, well, they have to get a green card if they going to do any kind of work, you know, in movies",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and, and such.",,INFO
But most of them have temporary visas.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I guess you can get work visas pretty easily, uh.",,INFO
"As long, it's like well,",,INFO
"it's a kind of a bad, a bad, bad example,",,INFO
but when Rafael Septien took the job with the Cowboys,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it.,,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"So that, you know,",,CAT
and that's the thing with the jobs.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And of course no one beat him out.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, you know. He just ruined his own career,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Oh, well yeah.",,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the, one of the few countries that people are still desperately trying to immigrate to.",,INFO
"Uh, although I guess Europe, now that the Communism is falling apart, that maybe there'll be, won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the Communist com-, countries, uh,",,INFO
"I guess Poland now, now is noncommunist",,INFO
so,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"maybe not,",,INFO
"maybe immigration from Europe to here will s-, you know slowly, uh, change,",,INFO
"maybe it'll be, even out like trade, you know.",,INFO
"So many people will immigrate here in the twentieth, at the year two thousand,",,INFO
so many of the people will go back overseas.,,INFO
"You know, maybe it will average out,",,INFO
I don't know.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think so.,,CAT
"It doesn't, has, doesn't seem so far.",,INFO
"Because there are other I, j-, uh, job opportunities,",,INFO
.,,CAT
in Europe that there aren't here,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, even, um,",,INFO
"like or-, orchestra players can find a job sometimes in Europe when they can't find one here.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I'm a trumpet player.,,INFO
Are you a teacher?,,QUESTION
"Uh, no,",,CAT
"I, uh, I don't any more.",,INFO
I just went to school,,INFO
and I was a music major for a while.,,INFO
"Oh, really,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
But I had a trumpet teacher that played in the Mexico City Symphony.,,INFO
"So,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
so he had to have a work visa there.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And of course they had a lot of musicians from, from other countries",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, in the Mexico City Symphony.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But I think, um, like three out of the four other people in the trumpet section are from Mexico now.",,INFO
"Oh, really.",,CAT
"But I think the conductor, I don't know, or one of the conductors is, is from another country.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
It's like any other symphony.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
"You know, and then, and Eduardo Mana's from Mexico",,INFO
"so he had to,",,INFO
,,
"All right,",,CAT
"Amy, how are you doing today?",,G_G
"Fine,",,G_G
fine.,,G_G
"All right,",,CAT
I think we know what we're going to speak about.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, I tell you what, I'll start off.",,INFO
How's that?,,QUESTION
"Okay,",,CAT
you go ahead.,,COMMAND
"Um, I personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"criminal cases that they should bring back hangings on weekends,",,INFO
In public places.,,INFO
in public places.,,INFO
"There is one state that does that, by the way.",,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
What is that?,,QUESTION
"I want to say Oklahoma,",,INFO
I saw something the other night about it.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
They don't do them real often.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Which is obviously the death penalty.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Um, but I think if we quit, uh, building, these Taj Mahals with the color T V -s and sixty dol-, sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a, on a, on a life sentence, we should start hanging them and get it over with",,INFO
and let's just screwing up the system.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, the sentences are so unbelievable.",,INFO
"I just saw on the news last night, that they said the average time a sentenced murderer, you know, is in jail is two years before he's paroled, and a rapists is like six months,",,INFO
That's pathetic.,,INFO
and a burglar is like two months.,,INFO
That's pathetic.,,CAT
"Because they just say there's either no room in the system, you know, in the jails for them",,INFO
"or, you know, it's just that, it seems like the automatic sentences, if, if a judge has leeway, on what he's going to, you know, sentence someone for between, you know, two months and fifty years and, you know, what's his whim to decide it should be two months.",,INFO
"This is true,",,CAT
"You know, it's crazy.",,INFO
"an, and the way the law reads, uh, if they sentence you to life in prison, then he's available for parole.",,INFO
"If it's life and a day, then he's not eligible for parole.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, what, you know,",,CAT
let's quit B S -ing with the system.,,INFO
"Well even if it's life, like you say, we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some, you know, joker in there for life.",,INFO
"We could spend that money, you know, for children that are starving, or twelve million other things would be more useful than that.",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
"So to me if somebody has life, you know, beyond a reasonable doubt they should, that should be it.",,INFO
A life for a life.,,INFO
"You know particularly for some of these really, I mean,",,INFO
"there are so many just major, major serial murders,",,INFO
"it's not just like one instance, or something, it's just, uh, horrifying, some of the murders that go on.",,INFO
The old Charles Manson case.,,INFO
"I mean the guy is really,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"an,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that.,,INFO
"just shouldn't be allowed to, to even, even live.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, about the issue about sentencing by the judge.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"The, the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene, uh, when there's a, my understanding, when there's uh, a verdict",,INFO
and it,,CAT
"for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth, today, in eight to four",,INFO
"and bam, bam the guy got off.",,INFO
"Uh, he was, he was a veterinarian, and killed two, a father and a son, okay.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
I heard about that on the news.,,INFO
"Uh, it kind of gets back to the second request,",,INFO
"we've been asked to look at, is most criminal cases requiring an unanimous verdict.",,INFO
"In a situation like that, I'd say no,",,INFO
let's just go like a regular vote.,,INFO
"Eight to four tells me that there were eight,",,INFO
"there's a certain perc-, percentage of the people there, with sixty percent of the people, uh, seventy percent of the people said, hey,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
they guys guilty.,,INFO
"Rather than have to retrial the whole, whole thing and spend all the money for people to, uh, you know, go back to court and all the lawyers",,INFO
"and, I mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a, you know, a fortune to keep doing that.",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
"And the victims, you know, the family of these people that have been murdered, they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution.",,INFO
"Exactly,",,CAT
"because it's not next day they have, the, start the trial, it's X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"I think that, that if it's, if it's not a split decision, go with the highest number",,INFO
and let's just get on with the program.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But as far as the sentencing by the judge, I would have to vote against that since there is a jury, because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"Uh, what are your feelings?",,QUESTION
"Well if I,",,CAT
"I saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge, I believe from Florida,",,INFO
"and she just has, just really stiff penalties",,INFO
"and I saw that in, in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really, you know, took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved, it could, you could have a, a judge that would really make a good impact.",,INFO
"But likewise, you could have the flip side, and have some judge that was paid off or, you know, had go-, a good old boy network",,INFO
"or for whatever reasons, you know, politics, just let all kinds of people through",,INFO
"so, he, he would have a heck, or she would have a heck of a lot of power, you know, if used wrongly.",,INFO
"So at least the jury system does something to prevent that, you know, or help it with it anyway.",,INFO
"I don't know if it prevents it,",,INFO
"but, seems like the jury system does have it's advantages.",,INFO
"But I also, I've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient, you know,",,INFO
"and I don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers, at that point, they're really getting a select group.",,INFO
It's not just random people.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"It almost should be the first twelve people that they, you know, have on a list are the ones that are on the jury",,INFO
and that's it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I get back to Price's comment when he, uh, was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks, uh, you know, from his neck of the woods.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Well give me a break, you know.",,CAT
"He'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"Exactly,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"I mean you're, you're in Dallas",,INFO
"so everybody,",,INFO
"I can't believe they can,",,INFO
"uh, like in a murder situations, they look for juries who don't know anything about the system, well or know anything about the, the occurrence,",,INFO
"you'd have to be pretty dense,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you'd be, you'd either have to be in a cave not to know what's going on, or moving it to Lubbock,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"or somewhere, possibly is not the answer.",,INFO
"Oh, they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically.",,INFO
"This is true, so true.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
Well this has been an interesting conversation.,,INFO
"Well, really, this is, breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors, I mean,",,INFO
what can I say.,,QUESTION
"So, you're at the house you're not at the plant.",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"I'm at home with two little ki-, preschoolers.",,INFO
My husband works for T I.,,INFO
"Oh, that's good,",,G_G
that's good.,,G_G
"I thought I heard a holler there in the background,",,INFO
but I wasn't sure.,,INFO
"Oh yeah,",,CAT
"I've got the dog and two kids waiting here,",,INFO
I'm just locked up in the laundry room,,INFO
"Oh goodness,",,G_G
"well, I'll let you get,",,INFO

thanks a lot.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G

Bye.,,G_G

I don't know.,,CAT
"I grew up, uh, in the, the sixties,",,INFO
"and at that time, uh, it was is a changing time for the whole music scene, I guess",,INFO
"and I grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it I guess for several years after I graduated from college and, and thereafter",,INFO
"but have since, uh,",,CAT
"I grew up in a small town in, in southern Oklahoma",,INFO
"I have kind of gone back to, uh, more of a county, uh, flavor in music.",,INFO
"Um, I'm not quite sure why that is",,INFO
"and it seems like almost a opposite,",,INFO
"but I guess I got away from what I consider to be the pot, uh, sounding music.",,INFO
"It didn't have what, you know, I guess what I was looking for at the time country tells more of a, a story.",,INFO
It kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up,,INFO
"and I've, I've become I guess more of a country fan over the years.",,INFO
"When you say that you grew up, uh, in the sixties I take it that was the, uh, teenage type years",,QUESTION
"or, uh,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
that was my teenage years.,,INFO
I was born in fifty,,INFO
"and, and, uh,",,CAT
"Okay,",,CAT
"we, we're very similarly aged,",,INFO
"so we probably have an in-, interesting perspective on the music on the times,",,INFO
"so I'm just a couple years older than you,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"um, essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that I, for one reason or another I didn't pay much attention to music,",,INFO
"but as I look back now I realize it was very formative for me,",,INFO
"uh, my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel, whom I saw perform when I was in college",,INFO
"and I became attached to that style of, uh, urban, urban country if there is such a thing,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think with, in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend, uh, to have a dramatic or story approach to their music, uh, usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it.",,INFO
"Uh, over time I became very interested in, in baroque classical",,INFO
"and I think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found it, it very relaxing for me.",,INFO
"My tastes now run I guess to a upbeat, uh, Simon,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"it's something that interests me, uh, combined with, with the classical tastes I had mentioned.",,INFO
"And my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds, early eighteen hundred music.",,INFO
"I'm not a music, um,",,INFO
", I'm not particularly schooled in it.",,INFO
I know what I like to listen to as far as classical music.,,INFO
"And I,",,INFO
That's kind of the way I am.,,INFO
"I spent a good deal of time listening also to, uh, people from the late seventies, really, um, Neil Diamond, for instance. Um, people of, of that particular time,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I listen to some country and western,,INFO
"but I'm not sch-, schooled in it",,INFO
"and I, I've enjoyed the times when I have listened to it.",,INFO
I played a little bit of piano.,,INFO
I continue to do that.,,INFO
I want to do it,,INFO
"and I never have the discipline to stay with it,",,INFO
"but when I do play, uh, and begin to reacquire skills I inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a, for a new piano player.",,INFO
"It is, it's got, uh, basically an easy, uh, rhythm and, and tone.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And it's, it's pretty, fairly well easily to uh, uh, something to fall into.",,INFO
"I'm kind of the say way,",,INFO
"I, I've gone through different periods of life, uh, in music from pop to classical.",,INFO
"I guess one of the things was that influenced me was that I, I've worked in radio stations as a D J for all my college years trying to support my way through there,",,INFO
"and suppor-,",,CAT
"was support,",,CAT
I was influenced by all different kinds of music,,INFO
but basically because that's where I worked.,,INFO
"And I've developed a real love for, uh, classical music in, probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was, uh, heavy into classical type music.",,INFO
"He said he used to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music, uh, that they were using behind them because they used, especially Disney used a lot of classical music, uh, behind the cartoons",,INFO
"and so consequently we wind up, wound up playing a lot of classical music there",,INFO
"and I think that, uh, got deep seated into me.",,INFO
"One of things I especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is, uh, are those that call on those classical, uh, roots, I guess, uh, Barry Manilow comes to mind for some reason there's, there's not a whole lot of his stuff that I'm real crazy about,",,INFO
but he does have some things.,,INFO
"Chicago had some things,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"uh, and I think even Electric Light Orchestra had some, some real, um, influences by classical music",,INFO
"and I'm still, still,",,CAT
"my favorite,",,INFO
in fact most of my C D -s are classical music.,,INFO
I find it very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy I particularly like the music.,,INFO
I don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation.,,INFO
"Uh, a good example would be, uh,",,INFO
"I have connections but, but not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, and I found that I really like CHINA BEACH",,INFO
and I particularly like TOUR OF DUTY,,INFO
"and both of them, I had as much fascination of the background music, I think going on as I did to the theme of the shows,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, and I, I've, uh, THIRTY SOMETHING I'm particularly interested,",,INFO
"but it's the music,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"almost that I find myself listening to, uh,",,INFO
"I'm kind of thinking that's maybe,",,INFO
"our generation was, uh, so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with, uh, things now with the music that's behinds them.",,INFO
That could well be.,,G_G
"I, I, uh, spent my junior year, uh, and sophomore and junior year in, in college when I,",,INFO
"a song by the, uh, uh,",,CAT
"I think the title of it was just Downtown,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, and if you recall how it goes downtown,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"ta, da, da, da,",,INFO
"uh, all I have to do is hear that song and I get strongly evoked memories of, of difficult times in school being behind on work,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, and my family now knows if they come into my study and, uh, I happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe I'm trying to get a project done, uh, at school, uh, and I'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away,",,INFO
.,,CAT
.,,CAT
That's their signal.,,INFO
"They can hear the unconscious music signal behind it,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
that's right.,,G_G
"When did you first take your, uh, first piano lesson?",,QUESTION
"Uh, probably about first grade,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and I have, uh, returned about every four or five years to thinking that I would like to do something about it.",,INFO
I usually get to the point where I can play some of my favorite themes,,INFO
"and then inevitably I am swept away by the, the pressure of other types of things,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh,",,CAT
It is a time consumer.,,INFO
It is.,,CAT
"In order to continue to, to grow and",,INFO
"I, I always think that I'll be able to do it",,INFO
"and then I inevitably discover that I have no innate music talent relative to composition and that I struggle and really can't quite understand what is that other people take for granted,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
in composition themes,,INFO
"and I,",,CAT
keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang on them.,,INFO
"I have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"uh, but in a, in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude",,INFO
"and I keep thinking, gee, I thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand",,INFO
"but,",,INFO
.,,CAT
but it doesn't for me.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"it's making that, that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it.",,INFO
"I was never able to, to master all that.",,INFO
"In fact my brother and sister both, they were, oh, thirteen, sixteen years older than I, they went through the, uh, parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again,",,INFO
"they sold the piano,",,INFO
"and is the turns out I was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to,",,INFO
"so I,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
that's one of things I felt like I missed in life,,INFO
"and I, I really,",,CAT
"in fact, uh, one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin, that is played on, uh, piano.",,INFO
"I just, you know, I can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time to do that,",,INFO
"Oh, ,",,CAT
"maybe one of these days, I'll,",,INFO
"you know, I'm kind of like you, maybe one of these days I'll get around to it,",,INFO
"I'll do something with the piano,",,INFO
but probably not.,,INFO
"So we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance, uh,",,INFO
Just never got a chance to come out.,,INFO
No.,,CAT
That's the most fascinating thing,,INFO
"Well, it's a pleasure talking with you.",,G_G
"And you, sir,",,G_G
"Best,",,G_G
take care.,,G_G
of luck in your graduate school.,,INFO
Okay.,,G_G
Good-bye.,,G_G
Good-bye.,,G_G

"Okay,",,CAT
what do you like to cook?,,QUESTION
"I like, well I like to cook foods I like to eat.",,INFO
I like to eat Italian food best.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I find that I, that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals, type things and,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
they're kind of convenient.,,INFO
"That would be good for a dinner party, that, you know, to cook that because you don't have to deal with eight different things,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
coming out at once.,,INFO
Is that what you usually cook when you have a party.,,QUESTION
"Um, I usually have parties that are smaller groups.",,CAT
"I don't have, I've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like Thanksgiving and such.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And so, um, yeah,",,CAT
I guess I usually do.,,CAT
"I like to cook, um, heavy sauces, and, um,",,INFO
"Really,",,CAT
that sounds good.,,G_G
noodles and pasta and such.,,INFO
"Um, fattening",,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
actually,,CAT
"How about you,",,QUESTION
"what do you like to, to cook?",,QUESTION
"Uh, we,",,CAT
"it's funny that, um, we're talking about this,",,INFO
we just had a dinner party,,INFO
"and we had, um,",,INFO
our senior pastor and his wife came over.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I catered to their diet is the only thing, though,",,INFO
so it wasn't something I really wanted to make.,,INFO
I really wanted to make red beans and rice and with .,,INFO
Oh yeah.,,CAT
"you know, sausage,",,INFO
because I'm from New Orleans originally.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, um, I was going to make that, red beans and rice with the, those Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff,",,INFO
"and, uh, well there's salad",,INFO
"and then for desert I would, I really wanted to make, um, just brownies",,INFO
"or French donuts would have been good,",,INFO
but it's real hard to make them.,,INFO
"They don't really come out like they do in New Orleans, up here,",,INFO
I don't know why.,,INFO
Oh really.,,CAT
I don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe I have,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
Humidity or something.,,INFO
"um, that's what I want.",,INFO
That's what I like to make is just real neat stuff like that,,INFO
but.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Kind of like the Italian,",,INFO
"it's really good,",,INFO
but instead I catered to their diet,,INFO
so I made baked chicken in the crock pot,,INFO
"and, um, it was good and everything,",,INFO
"it had all the vegetables in it,",,INFO
"but, it seemed kind of boring compared",,INFO
"It kind of, uh, kind of down played compared to what you would like, huh.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Do you find yourself, um, with all the, um, cholesterol and, and high fiber changing the way that you fi-, that you entertain?",,QUESTION
"I find it changing the way that I eat, but not the way I entertain,",,INFO
"because I guess, I guess I feel like if they're on a diet like that, I'm going to, you know, honor that,",,INFO
but if it's just,,CAT
"another couple came, um, over a couple weeks later",,INFO
"and I made,",,INFO
what did I make that night.,,CAT
"I made a roast,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I made, um, uh,",,INFO
I can't believe this,,INFO
my husband broke the coffee pot I just bought yesterday.,,INFO
Oh no.,,G_G
I can't believe that.,,INFO
"Anyway, but I asked,",,INFO
"when Ricky and Carrie came over we made, um, a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And normally I, don't eat, we don't eat like that during the week because of the, you know, the calories and the fat in it.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But you know, when we're having guests, we just kind of say, oh just do it.",,INFO
And I made blueberry cobbler,,INFO
"and we had extra crust with it,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
it was so fattening.,,INFO
That sounds good.,,G_G
"But, I don't think we gained any weight from it",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Well, every once in a while I, I think I feel the same way.",,INFO
"When I'm entertaining, I don't take that thing into consideration unless it's really, really,",,INFO
"like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories,",,INFO
"so I think dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play, sometimes.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
I made an apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over,,INFO
and she didn't eat it.,,INFO
Oh yeah.,,CAT
"But I did bake apples so that it would be, not brownies, you know.",,INFO
I figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"So, um, I've read a good brownie recipe.",,INFO
"Oh, that's good.",,G_G
"But, uh, anyway, so I guess that's about what I did when I entertained.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, do you have anything else you want to say about it?",,QUESTION
"Um, nothing comes to mind right off,",,CAT
so I guess not.,,CAT
"Okay,",,CAT
well it was nice talking to you.,,G_G
Okay,,G_G

"Okay,",,G_G
bye.,,G_G
"Bye, bye.",,G_G
,,
Well I usually keep up with news by watching A B C news on television and reading the papers here the local DALLAS MORNING NEWS,,INFO
and then I also take the WALL STREET JOURNAL.,,INFO
Do you get a chance to do it at home,,QUESTION
or do you mostly like catch up while you're at work?,,QUESTION
Do you have a chance to look through the WALL STREET JOURNAL?,,QUESTION
I'm not sure what you do.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well I, well I, d-,",,CAT
at the office I generally catch the WALL STREET JOURNAL at lunchtime.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"I use part of my lunch period to, uh, read the WALL STREET JOURNAL.",,INFO
"Well the-,",,CAT
"Then, uh, I read the, the newspaper at home generally in the evening.",,INFO
I'd rather sleep the extra thirty minutes in the morning.,,INFO
I understand that.,,G_G
Well and you have a little bit better newspaper.,,INFO
The DALLAS MORNING NEWS is a good paper.,,INFO
Lubbock is kind of small,,INFO
"and the A J -s, uh, kind of dominant.",,INFO
"There's no competition, so what you get is what you get.",,INFO
We used to take the paper every day,,INFO
and I finally quit taking it because it stacked up.,,INFO
I never got around to reading it,,INFO
"and so I try to take, you know, weekend papers,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and then during the week, I catch up, you know, on the radio on the way to work or if I'm traveling around at lunch or on the way home",,INFO
"and hopefully I'm sitting down by the ten o'clock news to where I can kind of get a recap on T V, uh.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's, uh, what we do to,",,INFO
"it, we're never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television,",,INFO
No,,CAT
"so we catch the ten o'clock news,",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
"But I catch the news on the radio coming to and from work,",,INFO
"but radio news is, is rather short. Uh,",,INFO
It is.,,CAT
"most of the news stations, most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And if you catch the news stations, uh, you don't catch that much in the car.",,INFO
"Oh, I see.",,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
"but, uh,",,CAT
"We-, uh, it's frustrating to me because I really wish that I did have more I don't know, uh, what do I want to say? I wish that I was around more news.",,INFO
It's frustrating when I don't know what's going on.,,INFO
I feel like it's hit and miss,,INFO
and I haven't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis.,,INFO
"Somebody will say, oh did you hear about this that happened last week",,INFO
and it might be local,,INFO
and it might be national,,INFO
"and I'm like, no, I missed that one",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I have the same situation.,,INFO
"I tried the news magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK, U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and they'd just stack up.,,INFO
I wouldn't find time to read them.,,INFO
"You have to have time to sit down and concentrate on, on the stories",,INFO
"or e-,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"all of a sudden you look and there's three, uh, three weeks worth laying on the coffee table",,INFO
and you wind up throwing them out without reading them.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"Because it's too much trouble to try and catch up,",,INFO
so,,INFO
"That's true,",,CAT
"have to depend,",,INFO
"I guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that I don't think that, uh, my children even read newspapers, other than the T V guide section.",,INFO
"Uh, oh no",,G_G
"There's is all, uh, strictly television news.",,INFO
"A little bit that worries me, because I feel like the news is so biased.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"And yes,",,INFO
"they report facts,",,INFO
and yes,,INFO
"you can get an idea of what's going on,",,INFO
"but, you know, it's, an,",,INFO
and I wish they would just report the incident and then leave the commentaries out.,,INFO
"But so many times you get, well, uh, this is my opinion of what he meant by that,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and I'm like, who are you to judge. You know,",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
it's the same,,INFO
just report the facts.,,INFO
"thing with, the news magazines, like TIME and, and the other magazines.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"It's hard to celebr-, uh, to celebrate, to separate the news from the comment, because,",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"in the way it's presented their opinions is print, or presented as being the news.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news.,,INFO
And I feel like they sensationalize things that shouldn't be sensationalized.,,INFO
"I feel like they focus too much on things that, I don't know, you know,",,INFO
"so much during the Gulf War, they would ask questions that, uh, you wouldn't want broadcast.",,INFO
It's like if you tell us the answer to that you're telling our enemy what your strategy is.,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
But they keep asking these questions,,INFO
"and I thought it was really, well I don't know, asinine actually.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Stupid.,,INFO
Well so many of them also come through,,INFO
"and they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time. Whether it be the homeless or, uh, cancer or whatever",,INFO
"and then they devote, uh, an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"And, uh, uh,",,INFO
I agree.,,CAT
"particularly the local television. Uh, I know the, the Wednesday's Child bit",,INFO
and they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something.,,INFO
"I'm not saying that's not important,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
but they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's true,",,CAT
"that's true,",,CAT
and it's frustrating.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"s-,",,CAT
"So I guess, I guess when I get to listen to the news, it's, it's probably television or radio.",,INFO
I see very little paper,,INFO
"but, I, I don't get to see that as much as I want",,INFO
and when I do I'm wondering why I wanted to see it so bad,,INFO
"That's, yeah, that makes sense.",,CAT
"We, uh, again,",,CAT
"like I say, by the time I read the newspaper it's the, the it's that morning's news from the day before",,INFO
"and I'm reading it in the evening,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I'm a, I'm about a day behind most of the time anyway",,INFO
"Exactly,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well I'm glad tha-,",,INFO
"it makes me feel like I'm not alone, though, in the world.",,INFO
"I, I used to think that I was probably the only one that just, I don't know, was running around so much.",,INFO
"I look at other, uh, women workers or, men at work,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
that have kids and families,,INFO
"and I'm like, how do they seem so together all the time.",,INFO
I always feel like I'm running a rat race.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"we, we,",,CAT
"So, I guess news is just part of that rat race for me.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah,,CAT
my wife and I feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It's always, there's something going on all the time, uh,",,INFO
"you don't really have time to sit down and, and thoroughly read a newspaper.",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
As a matter of fact I read the Sunday paper this evening.,,INFO
Well.,,CAT
We had such a busy day yesterday.,,INFO
Didn't find time to even read it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's incredible too.,,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
well that's about all then.,,COMMAND
Well I appreciate talking to you.,,G_G

"But this one was, I thought was excellent.",,INFO
"The ,",,CAT
Was that the animated version?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
it's animated.,,INFO
And I can't believe how good they're getting with their animation now.,,INFO
"It's just, just the special effects, you know.",,INFO
"And in this movie, this, there's this boy",,INFO
"and he rescues this, uh, bald eagle",,INFO
"and, uh, and it's a huge eagle, you know, wing span of twenty feet or something like that.",,INFO
And the boy actually rides on his back,,INFO
"and he rides through the clouds, you know,",,INFO
"and you see him coming out of the clouds, his head coming out and then the bird coming out,",,INFO
"and it, you know, they're flying all over with it.",,INFO
"And I mean, I know they, there must have used, been computers or something for animation this day,",,INFO
"but it was just so real, realistic and lifelike and good animation.",,INFO
It was a good show.,,INFO
Even better than ROGER RABBIT insofar as animation?,,QUESTION
"Well, ROGER was a composite one.",,CAT
Yeah .,,CAT
"There's one, there's a movie I've seen, ROGER RABBIT.",,INFO
"That's not a recent movie,",,INFO

"that was made in a few, I don't know, several years back, I guess.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Latest, latest one I've saw which was a mistake to go see was LIONHEART,",,INFO
had Claude Van Damme.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"He was, he's of course, uh, I guess he's trained in this, uh, martial arts of some sort,",,INFO
"but the plot was bland,",,INFO
the acting was bland.,,INFO
It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to,,INFO
"Chop them up, huh?",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"chop them up,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
"And,",,CAT
"This is supposed to be the, the guy that's, uh, replaces Bruce Lee or whatever or,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT

Uh-huh.,,CAT
super,,INFO
Superstar.,,INFO
"superstar of any sort, you know,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT

if not more,,INFO
"or, and all of them, I guess, could be in that fashion,",,INFO
Hum.,,CAT
or category.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT

"Yeah,",,CAT
"I haven't heard, I hadn't heard much about that movie.",,INFO
"I,",,CAT
other than it was a chop them up movie.,,INFO
"But, uh, well, I guess that's one I won't go see",,INFO
"Well, it was worth the buck I guess.",,INFO
"Oh, you went to the dollar movie?",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"they show up at the dollar movie right after they get, come out.",,INFO
"You know they're usually not, not that great or didn't do that great anyway.",,INFO

Have you seen that one yet?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"What, what, what,",,CAT
"I, I absorbed all of that movie in one sitting.",,INFO
"Uh, I guess what made it so good was the cinema-, cinematography,",,INFO
"The, the wide open, the spaces,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
and the music,,INFO
"and, uh, well, it had an excellent story line.",,INFO
Everything about it was good.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, I thought an excellent one, too, was MISERY with Kathy Bates and James Caan.",,INFO
"I'm not a James Caan fan,",,INFO
but that was a well directed and acted movie.,,INFO
Is that right?,,QUESTION
I'd recommend it.,,INFO
It's a little on the violent side,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but then what movie isn't anymore.,,QUESTION
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"our movies today, it used to be X",,INFO
"and, you know, and P G -s used to be R -s",,INFO

"Well, I have no objections to it.",,INFO
"It's just, uh,",,CAT
"and it's a matter of your taste, uh,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"It's just that,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"it's just that the rating system seems, you know, instead of having X now, they have what, N C seventeen?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"They just changed it because X had a connotation with it, you know,",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
And even on those type they don't show what you expect.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT

A lot of those are really violent type movies.,,INFO

I have.,,INFO
That was pretty good.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I read the book before,,INFO
"so I knew the story line going in,",,INFO
but they changed some things in the movie.,,INFO
It wasn't the same.,,INFO
"I thought the book was better than the movie,",,INFO
but I thought the movie was really good as well.,,INFO
I always wait for the movie.,,INFO
I don't have time to read the book.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I don't,",,INFO
I read about one or two thick novels like that a year.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know,",,INFO
"that's about all the time I can, I can spare.",,INFO
"But that was a good show I thought, you know.",,INFO
"I read about how they did, uh, an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine.",,INFO
"You know, that wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water.",,INFO
"It was, it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic.",,INFO

Huh. What's that about?,,QUESTION
"A, uh, special effects man who somehow gets involved in this, um,",,INFO
"oh, I'm not sure.",,CAT
I can't remember.,,CAT
It's been a while since I've seen it.,,INFO
"But he, he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody",,INFO
"and he has to go underground,",,INFO
and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done.,,INFO
Hm.,,CAT
"And, uh,",,CAT
"To, to fool people",,INFO
"and ,",,CAT
"Right,",,CAT
and using makeup and using the,,INFO
All the tricks.,,INFO
all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go.,,INFO

That sounds like an interesting concept.,,INFO
But you need to rent the first one first.,,COMMAND

"I guess they, they'll probably come out with a lot of movies, you know.",,INFO
"It was, it was such a rout though, you know.",,INFO
"I don't know, you know,",,CAT
"they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or,",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Kevin Costner I understand is supposed to be play Schwartzkopf, supposedly.",,INFO

"it's great,",,INFO
good teachers,,INFO
"good curriculum, uh,",,INFO

You know.,,INFO

"so, go ahead",,COMMAND
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
"it, it's, it's pretty much what I was s-, going to say",,INFO
is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I grew up in New York",,INFO
and,,CAT
Wow.,,G_G
"uh, the place,",,INFO
"or not New York City, upstate New York",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and s-, a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs",,INFO
"and it wasn't, we weren't too far removed geographically from each other,",,INFO
but the difference in schools I think was pretty substantial,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, one of the things that probably would have been better if, is if the entire county had had, had just one school system.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And that would result in some, uh, could result in more equitable distribution of money",,INFO
"because what was happening was, you know, all the very rich people went out to the, move out to the suburbs",,INFO
and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
of money to work with.,,INFO
"As a result, the schools were rundown,",,INFO
"there wasn't as many, you know, of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked.",,INFO
"There wasn't as many advanced placement courses, uh, when I was a senior",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
that some other schools had.,,INFO
"And, uh, it, it,",,CAT
"so I, you know, I think that one of the things, one of the ways to, to, to help schools in general, uh, and get them all to a minimum level of, of, of competency almost, would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people,",,INFO
"and the, the problem with that is then, then, then people will either, the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
they'll move farther away,,INFO
Right,,CAT
to get better schools.,,INFO
"So, you know it, it's kind of, you end up chasing, like a dog chasing its own tail sort of.",,INFO
"Also, uh, the, the family environment,",,INFO
"you know, you can come to south Tyler where I live",,INFO

there's parties.,,INFO

You can go to north Tyler to the schools,,INFO
and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know,",,INFO

Right.,,CAT
"They have no motivation from home,",,INFO
so they just go to school,,INFO

"which has been, you know, which is really nice,",,INFO
and,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think the difference for me was that my parents were, you know, they were definitely, they were always there,",,INFO
"was, like, well,",,CAT
"yeah,",,INFO
of course you're going to study and do well,,INFO
"and that's the way,",,INFO
"of course, are you,",,CAT
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"Um, I very seldom read a newspaper.",,INFO
I get most of my news information from T V.,,INFO
"Mainly, um, if I'm really wanting an in-depth thing I'll watch C N N.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I find it one of the best.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, otherwise it's just one of the regular, uh, channels eight or five.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, where do you get yours?",,QUESTION
"Uh, mostly from T V too.",,INFO
"I u-, usually start watching the news at five and watch it at five thirty and six",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"sometimes and, and then again at ten maybe just the headlines.",,INFO
"Um, we do take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS",,INFO
"and, uh, once in a while I'll sit down and read, read it, you know,",,INFO
but not very often do I read the whole thing.,,INFO
Quite often just scan through the headlines,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well, I take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS",,INFO
"and, and my husband, uh, he reads it cover to cover.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, if he thinks there's something that I need to know about he'll say, you know, here you need to read this",,INFO
"and, uh",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I don't know,,INFO
"it,",,CAT
"I kind of quit reading it, oh, I don't know several years ago when the kids were teenagers.",,INFO
"It just seems like I was so busy all the time,",,INFO
"and if I wanted to read, I wanted to read something light and relaxing and",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and, uh, things like that",,INFO
"and so I coul-,",,CAT
and it got so depressing,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
Seems like it wasn't anything but bad news,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"If there's something, you know, that I want to know more about or som-,",,INFO
might be the Killeen murders.,,INFO
I've been kind of intrigued.,,INFO
I guess it's kind of the sadist in everyone,,INFO
"You just,",,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"I, I will pick up if there's something really gruesome in there",,INFO
I'll go through and read it.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"Uh, but I find that I do better with, oh, remembering it and everything if I watch, uh, the T V",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"and, and they kind of capsize it",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and everything,,INFO
"and watch,",,CAT
"and I think sometimes it's, you know",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"maybe a little biased, you know",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"i-,",,CAT
something,,CAT
and sometimes.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You don't, you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts.",,INFO
That's true.,,G_G
You know.,,CAT
"I wanted a little more detail like, you know,",,INFO
"they would tell more about the people that were killed, where they were from and how old they were.",,INFO
"And I guess you just, you know, you",,INFO
Yes. Yes. *,,CAT
you just want to know,,INFO
"and with interest, you know I found some people that were members of our church which was different.",,INFO
"And that made you even feel a little more kin to, to what was going on.",,INFO
You found some members of your church that had been murdered?,,CAT
"Well, you know, of the same, same type of church that we belong to.",,CAT
"Oh, the same type of church.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
so that made it a little more and that they were from Utah also,,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Oh, uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"So that was interesting,",,INFO
but I enjoy the news.,,INFO
"I, I think our seven year old even e-, once in a while will sit down and watch it",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"with us,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"I used to, uh,",,INFO
or I didn't used to,,INFO
"but, uh",,CAT
No.,,CAT
"when my grandchildren had, uh, have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I thought that was very interesting,",,INFO
and I thought that was very important for kids.,,INFO
"Like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on, uh, in the war, they would bring it down to a child's level in words",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"you know, that they could understand",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
what was going on.,,INFO
"And, uh, I noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that.",,INFO
The oldest one he's,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
nine,,INFO
"and, uh, he would particularly enjoy this",,INFO
been a couple of years ago.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, I thought, I think that's really interesting.",,INFO
Actually I even understood it better,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's nice sometimes when they,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
they pull it down a little bit like that.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you know. And, uh, but as I said, uh, I ten-, you know,",,CAT
"I, I have kind of a blas3e attitude about, uh, news and news reporting which is, is not good, yo-, you know. *",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Nobody should get that way about the news.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
And what's going on in the world.,,INFO
"Oh, do you have a certain station you like to watch when you watch it",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
Yes.,,CAT
We like channel eight.,,INFO
Do you?,,QUESTION
We like it.,,CAT
It's the best.,,INFO
"Um, channel five for some reason has always been",,INFO
Is that been,,QUESTION
the one I watch.,,INFO
your favorite?,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I, I don't know",,CAT
it's probably the anchors.,,INFO
They just kind of catch you.,,INFO
"I don't, I don't know.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I very sel-,",,CAT
"and I thought it was very interesting, uh,",,INFO
channel nine watching it when the murders were in Killeen,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, and going on.",,CAT
They were having news coverage,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"The C N N, is that what that is?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
it was channel nine.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"And, you know they have that hour that nine to ten",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
of an evening.,,INFO
And so we had the T V on,,INFO
"and we were trying to catch all of it,",,INFO
and they were showing some,,INFO
"and I was watching,",,INFO
"my husband and I were watching it,",,INFO
"and then we switched over to channel eight,",,INFO
and the difference in coverage was unbelievable.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I can understand why channel eleven is, uh, you know, why they're kind of behind.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Did I say channel nine to begin with?,,QUESTION
Yeah,,CAT
That's,,INFO
No,,CAT
why I wondered.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"No, chan-,",,CAT
I don't get that channel,,INFO
channel eleven I meant.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I was thinking nine to ten.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But channel eleven,",,INFO
"That is if you, if you want to go to bed early",,INFO
"it's nice to, to, to watch that early news",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"sometimes,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"It, uh,",,CAT
"but the coverage wasn't near as good as when we, you know, switched over to channel eight",,INFO
"and they didn't e-,",,CAT
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"well, what, uh, what do you all do for camping?",,QUESTION
"Well, we don't do so much now,",,INFO
"but when, uh, I was, uh, a child, we went regular old camping, tents and",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and everything like that.,,INFO
"And then with our children, we did, uh, we had a pop up tent camper.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And we used that to go camping.,,INFO
Where do you go?,,QUESTION
"We, uh, years ago we lived in Oklahoma",,INFO
"and we went to, uh, Lake Ardmore, I mean",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
Lake Murray,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,INFO
all the time.,,INFO
"But, when we did it with our children, we lived in, uh, Tennessee",,INFO
and we went up to the,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
Smokeys.,,INFO
.,,CAT
Which was just absolutely fantastic.,,INFO
"Oh, I bet it was.",,G_G
"Around Gatlinburg, or",,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
somewhere up in there?,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
And,,CAT
Um.,,CAT
"along the, uh,",,INFO
there's a ridge that goes down from Tennessee,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"through, uh, Georgia and into Alabama",,INFO
"and, uh, I think it was called, uh, uh, White Cloud or White Mountain.",,INFO
"Well, now did you all",,QUESTION
And went up on it.,,CAT
sleep in sleeping bags,,INFO
"and did it get real cold at night,",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"It got real cold,",,CAT
"but the, uh, camper had, uh, beds in it, you know",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"when we had that one,",,INFO
"and, uh, so we just, you know, we had our bedding.",,INFO
We didn't have to go with sleeping bags.,,INFO
"But the when I was a, a teenager and growing up, that was sleeping bags",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and joining blankets and sleeping on ledges or, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
ground,,INFO
"And, uh, that got kind of rough sometimes",,INFO
"Well, we only did that once.",,INFO
"Now since we've been married, we just go, uh, we go real often to Colorado to the mountains,",,INFO
but we'll,,INFO
"Oh, do you?",,QUESTION
stay in cabins.,,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"And, you know, call that going camping,",,INFO
but we're really not.,,INFO
"But, the one time that I did go camping when I was about, I guess sixteen or seventeen with my family,",,INFO
"we drove to, uh, up by C-, Cosa Springs, Colorado.",,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"And went back seventeen miles back in the back where you couldn't even get a forest ranger if you tried and to the, the tent for a week.",,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
"And at night it was so cold, you thought you'd never feel your,",,INFO
.,,CAT
feet again.,,INFO
"And the smell,",,INFO
and the stars were just five feet above you.,,INFO
"You know, they were just right there.",,INFO
"Oh, just beautiful.",,G_G
"And it was the most bonding, most wonderful time.",,INFO
We enjoyed it.,,INFO
"But about the fourth day, I thought, if I don't get a hot tub and",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"shave my legs, I'm going to die",,INFO
And I had,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
I understand that,,G_G
"I, I got enough of it right then.",,INFO
"So, when we can go to a cabin as long as we've got running water",,INFO
"But, yeah",,CAT
I'm a little bit better off.,,INFO
"my husband and I, his, he says his idea now of roughing it is the Regency Hyatt.",,INFO
I know that .,,INFO
"And I, I agree with him.",,INFO
"I agree with him, too.",,INFO
"Our children are, are grown,",,INFO
but I know that we liked it when our kids were teenagers because we got away from the T V,,INFO
"Well, that's true.",,G_G
and the phone.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And we got just strictly by ourselves.,,INFO
"We, uh,",,CAT
some of the time we would not allow them to take friends along so that it was just the four of us.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, you know, and we could, you know, get back in touch with",,INFO
"Well, that, that's,",,CAT
each other,,INFO
And they can't believe that they could survive it.,,INFO
And then once they're there,,INFO
"Oh, I know.",,G_G
"they, they think it's kind of cool.",,INFO
I know.,,G_G
"Oh, they just, you know, they just thoroughly enjoy it.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You know.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Or enjoyed it.,,CAT
"And we hike, we would hike all day.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Mom did the whole, uh, pork and beans and, you know, the slice the potatoes and fry them outside and",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
all the little stuff that we just were so amazed that she knew how to do,,INFO
"You know, couldn't believe,",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"like I, I know that, you know, breakfast, we would, you know, we'd have these big breakfasts cooked over this little Coleman",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
with bacon.,,INFO
stove,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Yes,",,INFO
and it would just absolutely taste wonderful.,,INFO
"And, and daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast",,INFO
Yes,,CAT
so we usually had a bite apiece,,INFO
.,,CAT
One.,,INFO
"One,",,INFO
"yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
One.,,INFO
"But, I know that we, you know, as a teenager growing up and going to Lake Murray, there would be oh, maybe twenty, twenty-five of us because it would be all of my mother's",,INFO
"Oh, my goodness.",,G_G
"family, you know, and all my cousins.",,INFO
"And it,",,CAT
"Well, now, is that hot camping.",,INFO
"Is that where you're, you're hot, like on a beach,",,INFO
"I mean, is that,",,CAT
"Oh, no.",,G_G
"Because a lot of our friends will,",,INFO
"We were in the, we were in the woods, you know.",,INFO
"Well, a lot of our friends in east, will go to east Texas in the summer and camp",,INFO
"and I'm thinking, how could you stand it, you know",,INFO
"you,",,CAT
"Well, we didn't notice it back then,",,INFO
but that was back before,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"air-conditioning was so p-, you know, prevalent",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and all.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,G_G
"We didn't,",,CAT
"And, uh, you know, it, it always rained on us.",,INFO
"I don't care what weekend,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"we went and when it was, it always rained on us.",,INFO
"But, I like that,",,INFO
"and see, especially in the tent",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
every afternoon it would rain,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and you would get your book and just kind of cuddle up.,,INFO
"Cuddle up, uh-huh.",,CAT
And I thought that was fun.,,INFO
"Well, I don't know,",,CAT
"I remember one time, uh, some cousins were in a tent",,INFO
"and, it was married cousins,",,INFO
"and they, they had the tent",,INFO
"and this, you know, s-, frog strangler that we used to call them,",,INFO
.,,CAT
came through,,INFO
"and they had put their tent over kind of,",,INFO
"I don't know what,",,INFO
"it wasn't a creek bed,",,INFO
"it was like, kind of like a little, little, uh, gully",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"or trench or something,",,INFO
and the water rushed down,,INFO
and they said they looked down and there went,,INFO
"Oh, no.",,G_G
Bud's boots,,INFO
"and, you know",,INFO
"Oh, no",,G_G
"There went several things floating down this water, you know.",,INFO
We just used to have balls.,,INFO
Golly,,G_G
"You know, it was, it was more fun.",,INFO
"You know, and, as I said, it just rained every time.",,INFO
"Well,",,CAT
And then my folks had a cabin at one time at Lake Tenkiller,,INFO
"and we went up there,",,INFO
but it was never quite the same thing.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You know.,,INFO
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
"I understand that, too, because some of the places we,",,INFO
"in fact, the, the more urban we get with the television and the cabin and the whole bit, it loses it's flavor.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"yes,",,CAT
it does.,,INFO
"So,",,CAT
"It really does. Uh,",,CAT
"Well, I've, I've gotten in the mood to go now",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
even I would kind of like to go.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
"And I know if I go home and say, oh, let's go camping, my",,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"husband says, you're crazy",,INFO
You're crazy,,CAT
"Well, listen, I enjoyed talking with you.",,G_G
"I enjoyed talking to you, too.",,G_G
Okay.,,G_G
Have a good day.,,G_G
Thank you.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
so now what are your opinions on recycling?,,QUESTION
"Well, I definitely think that we need to start recycling.",,INFO
"I think it has got to be an individual responsibility until,",,INFO
"I think if we wait, uh, which is happening until somebody says we have to do it",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
it is going to be to late.,,INFO
I have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I have heard that too.,,INFO
"And that is not too far away,",,INFO
but I don't know how it is there.,,INFO
It is very difficult here even if you care like I do to do much.,,INFO
"I take, my paper,",,INFO
I can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them,,INFO
and there are some fire stations I can take newspapers to,,INFO
and that is very inconvenient cause I have to wait until I have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile.,,INFO
"Well see, I started saving newspapers",,INFO
and I would take a ton of them,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, that's, I can't remember where I went to take them,",,INFO
but they wouldn't take them.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It is real hard to find a spot,,INFO
"and then, I don't know if you note, even doing that, the amount of trash we throw away is incredible",,INFO
bottles,,INFO
Oh I know.,,CAT
glass,,INFO
"that cannot be, it could be recycled,",,INFO
"but there is no place to,",,INFO
There is no really recycling facilities.,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"We have a pilot program in Arlington going on I think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as, the trash as they put it out.",,INFO
I think that is a good idea.,,INFO
And I think that is what it is going to have to come to. Where we are just forced to.,,INFO
"Besides, well like a law or whatever.",,INFO
"An-, that's how it is",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
in New York isn't it.,,INFO
"I think so,",,INFO
just because they have to.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know,",,INFO
And you get ticketed if you don't do it right.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the,",,INFO
"it's, It's trouble for me to do what I do",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, I am willing to do it",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
Plus you have to have a place to store all of it,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and see I live in an apartment.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It is very difficult.,,INFO
Like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers,,INFO
"and, so, I don't know.",,CAT
I think there needs to be more places,,INFO
and also I have a real strong opinion.,,INFO
"In Iowa, the state I am from",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, I believe it has gone up to a dollar now.",,INFO
"Every time you buy a container, no matter what it is, whether it is glass, whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever, you pay ten cents for it",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and then you take it back to the store,,INFO
and you get it back.,,INFO
"Uh, so that way it kind of forces you to recycle.",,INFO
You are forced to.,,CAT
"And, uh, you also don't see the litter there.",,INFO
"People just,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
It makes it worthwhile to take it back,,INFO
"and I've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian,",,INFO
I don't know if you've tried it,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
I have seen them.,,INFO
"and they have on the ba-, it's five cents, that they pay five cents",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it even shows the states that,",,INFO
That take them back.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, on-, some of them are five, some are ten cents.",,INFO
I am looking at it right now.,,INFO
Is Texas one of them?,,QUESTION
Texas is not one of them see.,,CAT
"So, I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
I don't think that there is enough being done.,,INFO
"Now, I work at J C PENNY at their corporate headquarters.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And we have a paper recycling program that, uh, is company wide",,INFO
and I do the recycling for that.,,INFO
Do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper.,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
Good.,,G_G
Because there is a lot of waste there isn't there.,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
And I know there is a lot of computer paper,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
that you can't use.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"But, uh, we use to have, uh,",,INFO
"I mean, I don't even remember how much money that they've, uh, I mean, the money that they've made from the recycling program.",,INFO
They have donated it to charities.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
I mean,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
they have made a substantial amount of money from it.,,INFO
Something else I think we do can do is support companies that encourage,,INFO
"like, I have decided Downy Fabric Softener now has where you can buy a little carton",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you add wa-,",,INFO
"well, I image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later,",,INFO
but I am going to stick with Downey because they were first.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And I want them to have my business.,,INFO
And I think packaging could be done much better.,,INFO
There is so much plastic.,,INFO
"But,",,CAT
"Well I know,",,CAT
you see some of the stuff,,INFO
"and then when they come out with the new things, you are like, well why didn't you think of that before.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
And I think that it's just people have got to be aware.,,INFO
"Unfortunately, there are a lot of people that just don't care",,INFO
and they don't want to think about it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"And, uh, I just look at it, I don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something.",,INFO
"You know, I want to feel like I at least tried.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And I don't know.,,CAT
It just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it.,,INFO
Then we will be forced to.,,INFO
It may be too late.,,INFO
"Do they not ever, I mean, I don't know that much. Do they not ever burn trash or anything like,",,QUESTION
Very little.,,CAT
"That's another thing that,",,CAT
"see there were no,",,CAT
"Then, that's pollution.",,INFO
I know Amway.,,INFO
I use a couple of things from Amway that it says this is burnable material.,,INFO
"Well, that doesn't do me any good because I don't have any place to burn it.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I know.,,INFO
I guess you run into the pollution factor.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And then just like the glass bottles, that it says on the bottle I can get ten cents, but not in Texas.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And there is no place I can take glass to.,,INFO
"Uh,",,CAT
"So, I still throw away a lot of glass.",,INFO
It is really sad.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And then the packaging thing really grips me.,,INFO
You buy some,,INFO
"and it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic,",,INFO
,,
Okay,,CAT
You want to get a start?,,COMMAND
Certainly.,,CAT
"Uh, the weather here is warm.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And it has been sort of raining on and off.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, I am an avid gardener",,INFO
"so I m-, m-, measure the rain in our rain gauge on a, on a regular basis.",,INFO
So,,INFO
"Oh, great,",,G_G
great.,,G_G
"I can, can avoid wasting money on watering.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, but it has been threatening to rain for the last couple of days,",,INFO
"and it has not,",,INFO
.,,CAT
really. Which is a bit of a disappointment.,,INFO
But,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"it is very warm here, which is typical for this part of the, time of the year.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"How about Pennsyl-,",,QUESTION
"I think you are, I think you are earlier than we are, as a rule, aren't you?",,QUESTION
"Your, your, your s-, growing Summer starts a lot earlier than ours.",,QUESTION
"It starts in, uh, March as a rule.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"See that is quite a bit,",,INFO
we are just beginning.,,INFO
"People are, have got their gardens in, a lot of them now.",,INFO

Right.,,CAT

"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, I have had a little, a couple of problems",,INFO
"and, uh, I decided it is not worth it.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"That,",,CAT
"I, I like to get tan in the Summer time because I think you look healthier.",,INFO
"And, uh, we are just crazy",,INFO

"Now my sister is a, a sun fiend.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, she is five years younger than me,",,INFO
she is more wrinkled.,,INFO
Is that right?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"It,",,INFO
and I think that is why.,,INFO
it just makes your skin more leathery.,,INFO
"It, uh,",,CAT
Exactly.,,CAT
"it,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"I think it burns off the,",,INFO

or something like that.,,INFO
"Well, the elasticity of your skin, the collagen or whatever they call it.",,INFO
They say it destroys a lot of that.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
And you lose a lot of that.,,INFO
"So, uh,",,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT

"and, and getting out into nature and relaxing,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and having the family do a good share of the work, you know,",,INFO

"and we found that the, you know, what was one, one great handy things was this, uh, uh, uh, hamburger helper.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Because all you needed was a big frying pan,",,INFO

"Uh, when my oldest son, uh,",,INFO
always at the beginning I did all the shopping and everything.,,INFO

"and, uh,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"I mean, you know, he did it up really good",,INFO

That's neat isn't it?,,QUESTION
"We started out, uh,",,INFO
well we were living in Florida at the time,,INFO
"and we, early in life, we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very, very expensive.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
I agree.,,INFO
"So my ex decided, we're going to try camping",,INFO
and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent.,,INFO

right.,,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
I'm in Dallas.,,INFO
"Okay, uh,",,CAT
"we have not camped a great deal here because, uh, a good share of the time in the Summer time, it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping.",,INFO
"Well, it just depends on where you go,",,INFO
"for instance,",,INFO
"I gue-,",,CAT
"if you went down to the sea shore, it would be wonderful, a nice breeze blowing in from the water.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
we have done that,,INFO

Well that I wouldn't know,,INFO
I left there when I was quite young.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it is neat though because there are lots of lakes, fairly near by,",,INFO
you don't have to go very far.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, and there's, uh, a lot of trees, lot of mountains, and lot of, uh, hiking sort of things",,INFO
"and, and we had, uh, collapsible boat which we, clipper, little clipper sail boat.",,INFO

"I'd always,",,CAT
Nothing like the fresh outdoors.,,INFO

,,
They tell you what our topic was?,,QUESTION
"I think golf, isn't it?",,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
.,,CAT
How much of a golfer are you?,,QUESTION
Are you a hacker?,,QUESTION
You bet.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"I'm fifty years old,",,INFO
"I've been a hacker,",,INFO
"I think, I think I played better golf when I was fifteen, John, than",,INFO
"I know I,",,INFO
I play right now.,,INFO
"Oh, I know I did,",,INFO
I know I did.,,INFO
"And, uh,",,CAT
"Course, I know I watch my thirteen year old play now, you know,",,INFO
and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body.,,INFO
"Oh, I know,",,CAT
it's just unreal.,,INFO
"I, you know, I'm a guy that plays,",,INFO
"if I play a lot of golf, I play six to eight times a year",,INFO
and that's about it.,,INFO
I figure that's my retirement game.,,INFO
"I really,",,CAT
I come from a family of golfers.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean, I was raised by a man, my stepfather who, with a two handicap, I mean, he, he, he, he could get down on his knees and hit the ball, I mean, further than most people could hit it.",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"And my mother who is now, he's, my stepfather is dead, but my mother who is now seventy-one I can remember her being, I believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"but, but, uh, all they did every day in their life was to play golf every,",,INFO
"they'd leave work and go to a golf course, or a little country club they belonged to back in Richmond, Virginia and just, uh, play nine holes of golf.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"That was their deal,",,INFO
"they,",,CAT
"That's what it takes,",,G_G
"you, you need to play that often",,INFO
"But, uh",,INFO
to get a really good handicap .,,INFO
"I just, I just never could do it.",,INFO
"I have a brother-in-law who is, uh, an ex-college coach and like a pro",,INFO
and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf,,INFO
sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family.,,INFO
"Well, I went to,",,INFO
I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more,,INFO
"and I, I went after it",,INFO
"and did, and I really didn't find much improvement.",,INFO
"Fact, ever time I'd start trying to correct something, it seemed like the score would *",,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
"go, go back up,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"I, I",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"think I need to, uh,",,INFO
"I probably need to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and, uh, and practice more often.",,INFO
"Spend more time on the,",,INFO
I think I'm probably the same way.,,INFO
Lessons do help.,,INFO
"I know ever year we buy,",,INFO
"I go to this Ducks Unlimited dinner,",,INFO
it's a hunter's type affair,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I buy in, in Austin, Texas,",,INFO
"I go down to Austin,",,INFO
"I live in the Dallas area, but I go down to Austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and we always buy this weekend at a, at a country club in the hill country.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"You know, at, uh, Horseshoe Bay.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
I'm familiar with it.,,INFO
"And we just have a ball,",,INFO
"and we play three days in a row, three different courses",,INFO
"and, course, believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the, uh, third course, my score has gone from, you know, a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five.",,INFO
"So,",,CAT
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"if you play regular, I think it makes a big difference.",,INFO
"You bet,",,CAT
"so it, that makes a lot of difference to me.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"I, well, I've also found, too, I, I try to work out regularly",,INFO
"and when I am doing that, uh, and feeling loose and, that I swing better,",,INFO
"I, I, I get through the ball better.",,INFO
"Uh, and I also, if I,",,CAT
"I found as I've gotten a little older here, I worry less about my distance.",,INFO
You bet.,,CAT
"And I,",,CAT
my control is a little bit better there.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, so,",,CAT
That's super.,,G_G
I haven't learned to hit the ball easy,,INFO
"and I just sort of,",,INFO
.,,CAT
I'm always wanting to hit it hard,,INFO
"and, that's something my stepfather never could teach me, you know, just to relax and hit the ball,",,INFO
"and, you know, so, subsequently when I do tire out from playing like twelve, fourteen holes, my, you know, a lot of my energy's gone,",,INFO
when I do swing it's an easier swing,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I do, actually, hit the ball better.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Have you ever, have you ever tried a one iron?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"I have a two through, you know, two through wedge.",,INFO
I hit a two iron awful lot.,,INFO
"Off, now, off the tee.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I don't hit a driver off the tee.,,INFO
"That, that's why I need my driving lessons.",,INFO
"Well, you know, I put mine back in my bag this year, too,",,INFO
"and I, I used a three wood rather than a driver.",,INFO
That helps.,,G_G
"Uh, I had a lot more control on it, uh,",,INFO
"I sacrificed distance,",,INFO
but I wasn't in trouble every time I got down the fairway.,,INFO
"Well, that's, that's a good idea.",,INFO
"I think this next year, I'm going to, I'm going to attempt to play more",,INFO
and I'm going to do the same thing.,,INFO
"I, I laid off my woods about three years ago",,INFO
and I just use a two wood off the fairway,,INFO
and I'm a fairly strong person,,INFO
so I get a pretty good little drive,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I, and I guess control my irons, better, you know,",,INFO
"if you'll take lessons, the first thing they put in your hand is an iron.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
absolutely.,,CAT
"And, uh, I still remember that watching myself and my son",,INFO
"so, but I think the key is you just need to, you need to play more often than I play.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, I, I read recently here, they say, if you're playing, if you're scoring well, you should play more.",,INFO
"If you're scoring poorly, you should spend more time on the practice g-,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"uh, range.",,INFO
"Uh, I think there is less flus-, frustration factor there, too, uh,",,INFO
"Makes good, makes good sense.",,G_G
"So, but I, I,",,CAT
"the one iron is something I've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that I, I should pick one up and try to start.",,INFO
"Apparently they're very difficult to play with,",,INFO
"but with practice, I would imagine you could groove that swing, too.",,INFO
"And I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron,",,INFO
it's incredible.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"And, but, and his accuracy is what's so startling with it.",,INFO
"And I,",,CAT
"and it, but it's an iron that he's really practiced with.",,INFO
"He has used a lot,",,INFO
"and, uh, it would be fun to get that good at a",,INFO
You bet.,,G_G
"with an iron. Uh, distance iron.",,INFO
"My cha-, my challenge of the game is just, if I can get off the first tee when everyone's standing around watching you, I'd be",,INFO
.,,CAT
great after that,,INFO
"That, boy,",,CAT
"I just,",,CAT
"if I get off the tee box and I, and I've, you know, you know, anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight, I just want to get down and kiss the ground, you know",,INFO
"And get away without embarrassing yourself,",,INFO
right,,CAT
"Because,",,CAT
,,
You said you have four cats?,,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
I have four cats.,,INFO
How old are they?,,QUESTION
"Well they range from, let's see about a year and a half to nine years old.",,INFO
Oh gosh.,,CAT

"I haven't had my oldest one quite nine years,",,INFO
I've had him probably five years.,,INFO
"Oh okay,",,CAT
you get so attached to them.,,INFO
"Oh yes,",,CAT
I love my cats.,,INFO
"I lost one, one time, uh,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
the first one I got.,,INFO
"He jumped off the balcony actually, of a second story apartment.",,INFO
Oh no.,,G_G
"And he'd never been outside, like, you know, by himself outside.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And it started raining,,INFO
and I was hysterical.,,INFO
"I was, I was,",,CAT
"I mean, you would have thought a child had died.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"I called everyone I knew,",,INFO
I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
I understand.,,G_G
"And they laughed at me,",,INFO
they thought that was so hysterical.,,INFO
"Oh no,",,G_G
"I understand,",,G_G
"we, uh, we've gone through the same things with ours,",,INFO
"we've had, you know, they've been ill,",,INFO
"I mean I take off work,",,INFO
Oh yeah.,,CAT
"to take care of my cats, you know,",,INFO
my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy.,,INFO
.,,CAT
And then we had a baby,,INFO
"and it's like, all right who comes first the cat or the baby.",,INFO
The cat was here first,,INFO
"so I know,",,INFO
it's hard.,,INFO
"And, and then when we go to sleep at night, you know, it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us.",,INFO
"Oh, how funny.",,G_G
"It's like all right, whose corners is this one.",,INFO
"That's sweet,",,G_G
"I have the two,",,INFO
the other two cats I have are outdoor cats.,,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"And they didn't used to be actually,",,INFO
"but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside,",,INFO
so I put them outside once I got a house,,INFO
"and they're doing great out there,",,INFO
they love it.,,INFO
"But the other one, the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.",,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
Other than that he gets scared to death.,,INFO
If you shut that door he goes into hiding.,,INFO
Oh no.,,G_G
I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"uh-huh,",,CAT
that's it,,INFO
And Lord knows what happened to him.,,INFO
He's probably been through all kinds of nightmares.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
traumatized for life here.,,INFO
Probably.,,CAT
"Oh yeah,",,CAT
"we've,",,CAT
all four of ours are house cats.,,INFO
Are they.,,QUESTION
"We started out with two, with two outdoor cats",,INFO
but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them.,,INFO
Oh no.,,G_G
"Oh well he lived through it,",,INFO
"oh, I couldn't believe it.",,INFO
We went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills.,,INFO
Oh my gosh.,,G_G
"The, the cat almost died,",,INFO
"and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat,",,INFO
oh he loves life now.,,INFO
"Oh, I imagine.",,G_G
"And he's like oh, thank you so much.",,INFO
"I wonder how many of his lives he missed, when that happened.",,INFO
"I know,",,CAT
we wondered about that.,,INFO
"But, uh, oh that was a traumatic experience for us too.",,INFO
"Oh, I can imagine,",,G_G
what did he shoot him with.,,QUESTION
"Uh, well, uh, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun",,INFO
and then he started chasing him with a bull whip.,,INFO
Oh my gosh.,,G_G
People are crazy.,,INFO
"Oh yes,",,CAT
absolutely nuts.,,INFO
"But, uh, luckily enough, you know, we found the cat in time and, uh, rushed him to the vet",,INFO
and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
Oh Lord.,,G_G
"tod-,",,INFO
I mean he started off as a stray,,INFO
and then we did all this for him,,INFO
Oh man.,,G_G
"But oh, he's been a wonderful cat.",,INFO
I imagine.,,G_G
They usually are after something like that happens to them.,,INFO
It seems to mellow them or something.,,INFO
Oh yes.,,CAT
"But, uh, we wouldn't ha-, we wouldn't have them,",,INFO
"I mean, I don't see us without pets, without cats.",,INFO
No.,,CAT
"There's just, uh, there's this, they just fill this void.",,INFO
"Oh yeah,",,CAT
"I ke-, I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I don't, I can't take care of them as well because they're outside,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back,",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"and I feel like they need a big home, a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things.",,INFO
But I can't give them up.,,INFO
Oh no.,,CAT
"I just, I go hysterical when they don't come home.",,INFO
Right,,CAT
"and you worry about, oh, who's taking care of them.",,INFO
"Oh, oh yeah,",,CAT
and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And you go crazy thinking it might be yours.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
well I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night.,,INFO
"We, we-, I had one that had, we had, we had to put to sleep he got so sick.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, well I fell in love with this, uh, it's a Chinchilla Persian,",,INFO
Ugh!,,G_G
"and, uh, brought him home,",,INFO
"and oh, my husband just died.",,INFO
Really.,,CAT
It was like we can't take it back,,INFO
"you've got, we've got to keep it now.",,INFO
"It's here now,",,INFO
we have to keep it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"my, my first one that I got,",,INFO
I had just moved away from home and got my own apartment.,,INFO
"It took me about two weeks to realize, that was real lonely.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"uh-huh,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
So I found this one,,INFO
"and, uh, actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive-thru that said free kittens.",,INFO
Oh uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I thought well that's interesting,",,INFO
I'll call them.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
And he was the only one left,,INFO
and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens.,,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"And he was the last one she carried across, you know,",,INFO
the whole big sad story.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"So of course, I had to take him.",,INFO
I felt so sorry for him after that.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"And he is, uh, you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers.",,INFO
Oh no.,,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
"he,",,CAT
I asked the vet why he did that,,INFO
"and he said he was probably weaned too young, which he was, because his mom was killed,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
But he is the lovingest cat.,,INFO
"Everybody, people who don't even like cats, like him.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"He never meows,",,INFO
"he, he doesn't have any front claws,",,INFO
"I had him declawed,",,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
but he doesn't bite anybody,,INFO
"he's just, he's just kind of there, real friendly and docile.",,INFO
Oh that's good.,,G_G
"Oh we just, uh, just love them.",,INFO
"They, uh, you know, get to feeling so lovey and dovey",,INFO
and they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest,,INFO
"and it's like oh, your claws need trimming.",,INFO
"Oh yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"we do, we call that doing biscuits,",,INFO

"Yeah,",,CAT
I don't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is,,INFO

"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
I agree with you there.,,CAT

.,,CAT
"So, yeah.",,CAT
"I'm just getting, getting to that age I guess.",,INFO

"So it does work, it is effective. * 2 slash units?",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Huh.,,CAT
"The only problem is, you know, if you have done drugs but you've stopped and, uh, you do get caught, it is kind of, kind of harsh.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I suppose they fire you and everything right then, huh?",,QUESTION
"Or what do they do with you guys if, that you guys get,",,QUESTION
"Uh, we get counseling",,INFO
"and, uh, I think part of our pay is docked if we're",,INFO

first time offenders.,,INFO
"Oh, I see.",,INFO
"I really don't,",,CAT
"I, I haven't,",,CAT
I don't do any drugs,,INFO
so I don't know.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
well I don't either.,,INFO
I wouldn't even think about it,,INFO

yeah.,,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
", really.",,CAT
"You're so stupid, God",,INFO
"and you just watch it on T V and see how it just burns your brain completely up, you know.",,INFO
"You don't,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
wastes your future.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"re-, really dumb, huh.",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, Let's see, what else was I going to say here.",,CAT
"Uh, what do you think about our, uh, like, uh, other government agencies testing?",,QUESTION
Do you think our government agencies should test?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think so.,,CAT
I think they all should test really,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
you know.,,INFO
"Uh, it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"that, I don't know what's wrong with the people, uh,",,INFO
"but I think that the, the government should do something about stopping it completely.",,INFO
About it coming into our country.,,INFO
"You know, they just slap somebody's little hand,",,INFO
"and, you know, well, don't do that again",,INFO
and,,INFO
"Oh, I know,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
They aren't .,,CAT
"and then th-, you know, they'll get out",,INFO
and they're right back at it again.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Right now it is, it's too lucrative for the drug dealers",,INFO
so,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"th-, the risks are worth it for them.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, other than that, why, I don't know.",,INFO
"Like I say, maybe one of these days I'll get a job because I am looking still for a part-time job, you know, since my company went bankrupt",,INFO
and,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I'll see what they do, you know.",,INFO
"But, like I say, I, I wouldn't care because I, I don't, I don't even smoke",,INFO
so,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
they can test me all I want.,,INFO
I wonder what if you take medicine if that would effect it.,,QUESTION
"Oh see, that's,",,CAT
"tha-,",,CAT
it is a problem.,,INFO
"Sometimes some medicines will give off a, a false positive.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
see now that,,QUESTION
"I've heard of, I've heard of that,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"that would be really unfair then, huh?",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You know.,,CAT
I believe you should have the testing,,INFO
"but they should be, like, if you get, if you get a positive, they should double check you and still give you the benefit of a doubt.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Find out what, you know, if you have been taking some kind of medication and, you know, if that would effect it and everything.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, well I guess that's about all we can talk about.",,INFO
I think our five minutes is about up anyhow.,,INFO
"Well, it was nice talking to you Rose.",,G_G
"Okay, Lewis,",,G_G

I am.,,INFO
"Oh, good.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
I've,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"uh, she",,INFO
"been, uh,",,INFO
"had a hard time getting a few folks, uh,",,INFO
"I thought, well every, all these T I -ers have gone home, uh,",,INFO
"I, uh,",,CAT
at one o'clock on Friday.,,INFO
"It is Friday,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
.,,CAT
that's for sure.,,G_G
"Well, uh, I guess,",,CAT
I'm trying to think the last thing I did to a car.,,INFO
"I, I, I do it a lot.",,INFO
"I have,",,CAT
I kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid.,,INFO
"Oh, wow.",,G_G
Okay.,,CAT
"Uh, so, and my father and brother were in it",,INFO
"and, and my brother's still in it.",,INFO
"And I had periods when I didn't do anything,",,INFO
"but in the last ten years I've, uh, my car doesn't go to a shop, you know,",,INFO
"it, it,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I just do it all.,,INFO
"Do,",,CAT
"I, uh,",,CAT
"there's hardly anything that, other than putting tires on, that I'll do.",,INFO
I,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but,",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
I change the oil and transmission,,INFO
"and, uh, uh, I do, essentially do it all.",,INFO
"I don't know, uh, uh, if there's anything specific.",,INFO
"In fact, I could advise people, uh,",,INFO
I happen to be a M E besides.,,INFO
But,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I do it for fun really and to save,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
money.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
And I guess that's diversion.,,INFO
"Uh, I, I've, I've tried a few groups, uh, you know, where you,",,INFO
I can recommend it for people to take their cars.,,INFO
Like I think Sears is probably the best place,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"because,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I've heard, when I used to go there and when I,",,INFO
"I just overheard what they did for me, very little because I didn't take it that much.",,INFO
But what I heard them tell other people was always right.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"You know, when I sat there, I, you know, I dropped my car off for tires or something like that.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And so I respect,",,INFO
they seem to actually have mechanics there.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"I was pretty impressed with Western Auto,",,INFO
"but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission, uh, oil last time.",,INFO
And when,,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
"when I did it the next time, I realized the filter was loose and everything,",,INFO
and I didn't like it.,,INFO
So I'm just doing it all myself.,,INFO
"I, I,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"That's, that's the aggravating thing.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I try to do as much as I can.",,INFO
"I, uh, I grew up on farm so I've got that, uh, you know, take care of yourself attitude.",,INFO
You had to do it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"And, uh, oh, I've done, I've done various things.",,INFO
"I've got an, I've got an eighty-three T Bird",,INFO
"and I've, I've",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"changed out, uh, heater core and,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, oh, timing belts and things like that.",,INFO
"Um, I guess the last thing I took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car, um, when we went in for inspection.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"It didn't, it didn't quite pass.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So we had to have, uh,",,INFO
"that's, uh, that's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out, to get to it.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"And, uh,",,CAT
"Well, you like Fords, apparently, huh?",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"I've, uh, I'm kind of stuck on them right now, I guess.",,INFO
"But, you know, that's,",,CAT
it's partially because I can work on them.,,INFO
"That's, uh,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"that's, that's, that's a big part of my decision.",,INFO
"But, uh, yeah,",,CAT
"we ran into some problems with, uh, having them to work on that carburetor.",,INFO
"I mean, they get, they got everything tuned up right, you know.",,INFO
"But they,",,CAT
"we got, I got it home,",,INFO
"and, uh, and they had left the, uh, oil f-, uh, cap off and it was rubbing",,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
on a belt,,INFO
and it rubbed a notch in that.,,INFO
My goodness.,,G_G
"Li-, little things like that, that really start to aggravate you.",,INFO
"That, that's a lot of the reason I do my own stuff.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I won-, always wonder when you have little things like that happen, why, even here at T I, why we don't inspect, I'm in facilities, why we don't inspect areas and, and guarantee it so to speak. Uh,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"we always fix things and rep-, put things in and walk away.",,INFO
"We,",,CAT
there needs to be a time of inspection and check out.,,INFO
"And, and s-, thing like that with a car,",,CAT
there ought to be someone there that inspects it before it's turned.,,INFO
"There ought to be an insp-, inspector or quality insurance guy",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"after, after an oil change, you know.",,INFO
"Sure,",,CAT
that's,,G_G
Just,,INFO
right.,,INFO
"in case, uh, they didn't put the oil in or whatever.",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"i-,",,CAT
"I, I always wonder about that when, when someone does repairs or little things like that, uh,",,INFO
"Any, anything that gets, that, that's in a, gets to be an, an assembly line type operation,",,INFO
"you're, you're always risking that.",,INFO
"If there's, too many people that get their hands on one little project, you know, that things, they're, you get, y-, you miss that overlap",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"sometimes,",,INFO
"and, and they miss things.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I've, I've had a hard time finding anybody I can trust.",,INFO
"Like, like you say, it, it, well, transmissions and things like that.",,INFO
"I'm, obviously, I'm not going to, I'm not going to tear apart a automatic transmission",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
and try rebuild it.,,INFO
I don't either.,,INFO
"I don't either,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, i-, it, it's, it's real stressful to try to find anybody that I think's going to do me right.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, and, uh, you know, have an idea of what's going on.",,INFO
"You need to really, uh,",,INFO
"I, I do, uh, a lot of the simple things.",,INFO
"I, I think I do most of the things better than the average person.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You, you have Fords and I, I, uh, I have three Chevys, which",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
I worked my way into having the same engine.,,INFO
"I don't know how long I'm,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I like a V-eight.,,INFO
"And I'm, I'm,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"s-, sold on small block Chevy V-eights.",,INFO
"And I,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I bought one car new,",,INFO
"and I almost accidentally got the next car, although I was kind of looking for it when I got a u-, a used car with the same engine.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well then the nex-, the truck I got next, I definitely looked for the same engine.",,INFO
"So I buy filters, you know, three or four at a time.",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
And essentially,,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
the engines are different,,INFO
"y-,",,CAT
"the cars are different years, but the same Chevy V-eight.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And the par-, the carburetors is the same.",,INFO
Almost everything is the same.,,INFO
"Th-, the course is two are eighties and one eighty-six, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So you can learn a lot that way.,,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"there's no way I could, I could fix every car in the world, you know.",,INFO
"Well, yeah.",,CAT
"That, that,",,CAT
"the biggest, you know, that's the three biggest things to me, you know.",,INFO
"I-,",,CAT
"i-,",,CAT
"number one, you've got to have the tools around.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"If you don't have the, the special tools or,",,INFO
"well, any more",,CAT
"the, the testers, that, you know.",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"in my garage, you know.",,INFO
"So obviously if it starts, my car starts missing or something like that, th-, it's almost impossible to track that down any more",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
without a diagnostics.,,INFO
"But at the tools and the space to do it, that, that can be a big problem if it's, if it's under carriage or something like that.",,INFO
"But, then it's experience.",,INFO
"You know, you can, you can look through a, a Chilton's book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it.",,INFO
"But you better figure on multiplying that time out, about by at least by five or so.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Ju-, just, just by not knowing, you know, how to get to that, that one bolt or that one",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
screw or whatever to get things apart.,,INFO
"That was, that was the biggest thing when I did, uh, the heater core in my T Bird.",,INFO
That is got to be the worst location for it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, and the only reason I did it,",,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"I think they're all bad, really.",,INFO
"They're,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"The, the only ones I've ever heard good, good things about are, are the old Lincolns and Cadillacs where",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
they had the little door underneath the hood.,,INFO
You just open the door and pop it out.,,INFO
Is that right?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, but, uh, I, I had, I had taken this in to have it done originally.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh,",,CAT
What did they want to charge you for it?,,QUESTION
"Oh, it, it was, it was tremend-,",,CAT
well it was about seven hours labor.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So it, it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And they looked it over and they, they, they thought they could patch it up a little bit, you know, and what not.",,INFO
"So they,",,CAT
"This is your little water, uh, heater in there, for the, uh,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
the heat inside?,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And it was, it was leaking inside the car,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
in the condenser unit.,,INFO
"So, uh, they, they did a little patch on it,",,INFO
"and it l-, it held for about four to six months.",,INFO
And I finally went back in and started looking at it myself.,,INFO
"And i-, it's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff,",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"hey,",,CAT
"it was not, uh, it was not a seven hour labor",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
job for me.,,INFO
It was about a week before I finally,,INFO
Did you get it,,QUESTION
through.,,INFO
inside or outside?,,INFO
"I, I took one off my little Buick I had,",,INFO
and I pretty much took it loose on the inside.,,INFO
"But it came out from the, you know, underneath the hood.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It came from,",,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"this, this was,",,CAT
"the only thing that sticks, in, inside the engine compartment on this are the two, uh, hose fittings.",,INFO
"Maybe you're right,",,INFO
maybe you're right.,,CAT
"I,",,CAT
it's been a long time since I took one out.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It, it's,",,CAT
"I, I've never heard a good story about, uh,",,INFO
"Course, I broke mine, you know,",,INFO
so I'm always very careful when I change hoses on it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I don't know whether you did yours.,,QUESTION
Not to really pull on those.,,CAT
"I,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"when I take those hoses, I cut them off",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
very gingerly.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Because if you sp-, you know, pull on that,",,INFO
"and I've always done that as a kid, you know, just yanked on it.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time.,,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"But I broke one on my, on my Buick.",,INFO
"And I always remembered it was my own fault,",,INFO
"and I thought, well I'm going to t-, going to carefully take those hoses off.",,INFO
You bet.,,G_G
"Well that, that's what ended up being the real problem on this, was the, uh, i-, the, the pipe wasn't busted,",,INFO
"but the,",,CAT
it wasn't soldered in good enough.,,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"And it had, it had broken loose enough to where if it got hot,",,INFO
"It, it spread out,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
and just normal driving didn't do it.,,INFO
"But if, if, if it was an especially hot day, the pressure would get high enough",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and it would start blowing the water out inside.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It was real aggravating,",,INFO
"but, uh, I, I, couldn't eve-, even",,CAT
"a week's, a week's time is, is worth a whole lot less than, four, than four hundred dollars to me, you know,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
than to have somebody else do it.,,INFO
"Sometimes if you're a tinkerer, you luck out.",,INFO
"My wife's,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, Chevy, uh, it was a Caprice, air conditioning stopped.",,INFO
"I, I just heard it.",,INFO
I realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I went out there for five minutes,",,INFO
and I just pushed on the wires.,,INFO
"And sure enough, just pure dumb luck, that the connection over by,",,INFO
"it's not the evaporator, the big filter on one side.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I just pushed that in, and I heard it click.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And so sometimes you have dumb luck.,,INFO
"I, I was, you know,",,CAT
"you could have taken something like that and thought, well, the compressor's not working. Or it would have taken me all day probably if I didn't do that. But",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
sometimes you have some dumb luck. If you,,INFO
That's true.,,G_G
have a little curiosity and you have enough knowledge to check things out.,,INFO
"I know, I feel bad for people who just, when anything goes wrong, a fuse, you know, they just have to take it.",,INFO
And I know,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that's tough if you don't, uh, at least give it a shot.",,INFO
"I've got girls, daughters, and I've always said I'd teach them.",,INFO
"And my, my one daughter was fairly interested.",,INFO
"And I really haven't gotten around to,",,INFO
"I learned because I, I just, uh, learned, you know",,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things.,,INFO
And I'm going to do that.,,INFO
"I, I told my daughters in college this year, I said, This summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car.",,INFO
"I said, So you can learn the basics, you know.",,INFO
"Well, yeah.",,CAT
"A-,",,CAT
"and, and not only from a, from an economic standpoint, just, just pure safety, you know.",,INFO
"If you can,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to, to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait.",,INFO
"It, it,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"it can, it can save a lot of time and trouble.",,INFO
"I have the,",,CAT
"there's one expression I don't like, uh, the country expression, you know, if it ain't, if it ain't broke don't fix it.",,INFO
,,
What do you think about it?,,QUESTION
"Well, I, I feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately, that I think there are some occupations that they should, such as the health field, the transportation field, uh,",,INFO
"they're already doing it in the armed forces, where they handle weapons and so forth, uh,",,INFO
they do it to prisoners,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"so, I, I, uh, I, I, I feel like it should be mandatory in some professions,",,INFO
"and I think if, if, uh, an employer feels that he wants to, to drug test employees and they don't like it, then they should not be employed there",,INFO
"That was,",,CAT
"you know, I would not mind it.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else, you know",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"harm or injury, absolutely.",,INFO
"And I don't have a problem at all with employers, uh, testing in the hiring process,",,INFO
"but I, I, I don't, I don't have a problem with them too much, testing even after the fact,",,INFO
"but I do a little bit where it, where it wouldn't hurt anybody.",,INFO
"I don't know,",,CAT
sometimes I think they carry it a little bit too far.,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"But,",,CAT
unless an employer has a reason to,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"believe that his, uh, the work competency of, of the employ-, employee is, is hurting the business.",,INFO
Right,,CAT
"I mean maybe it's, uh,",,CAT
and then it's not a problem.,,INFO
"Number one because generally if, if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and as an employer, I would think that would be,",,CAT
"and the first,",,CAT
it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost.,,INFO
"Oh, absolutely.",,CAT
There's no way.,,INFO
"But, but my concern is, uh, school bus drivers.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Tr-,",,CAT
"the train drivers,",,CAT
"Um, I'm not even,",,CAT
"I'm in education,",,INFO
I'm not even opposed to it for that.,,INFO
"Uh, I'm concerned in the medical field.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I, I think they should screen for alcohol in these areas, too",,INFO
I wish they would.,,CAT
because I consider that a drug.,,INFO
"I wish they would,",,CAT
"and that, I think, is even probably more widely abused",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"by, you know, the masses",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"than, than drugs, so to speak.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
So.,,CAT
But when you consider they could be driving an airplane,,INFO
"Oh, I know.",,CAT
"or driving a bus, or a train, um",,INFO
"And,",,CAT
and it doesn't take that long.,,INFO
They don't have to be totally roaring drunk,,INFO
No.,,CAT
just a little,,INFO
"Just, uh,",,CAT
off on their timing,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and,",,CAT
"could, could mean life.",,INFO
Now T I has the random testing policy,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"and, and, you know, our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a, in a pool",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"so I've already been tested once when I was hired and, and once since they initiated this random testing program.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"But I work with one girl who was tested, her name got, got randomly selected three times in six months",,INFO
"Oh, my word.",,G_G
"and I think that's the only reason I have a problem with it, when there's no, you know, there's no reason",,INFO
Control.,,INFO
"to suspect someone, you know.",,INFO
"That, that's getting a little bit,",,INFO
that's enough to make anybody paranoid,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Well, as long as you accept that it is a random, a random testing",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, you know, to, to alleviate,",,INFO
that way you can't feel like somebody's out to get me.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"If,",,CAT
it's almost like being selected for jury duty,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel,",,INFO
"that's, that's just the way it is.",,INFO
"Either just the lucky or the unlucky one, depending on how you look at it.",,INFO
"I would, I would rather have it that way, to know that I was chosen at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in",,INFO
"Oh, absolutely,",,CAT
"because I, I think there's, when you let other employees turn in people,",,INFO
"There are so many people with, with their petty axes to grind",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
it could really get,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
out of hand.,,INFO
"So, I, I, I would really rather know, however,",,INFO
there's got to be some backup to say that,,CAT
"if, if somebody does observe you at, say at a party, uh, using drugs",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I would think that it would be their obligation to report that.,,INFO
"To report it,",,INFO
"and I guess you'd report that to a supervisor, maybe",,INFO
"Personnel, or something,",,INFO
anonymously or something,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"because I, I would feel very uncomfortable working with someone I knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol,",,INFO
I'd just,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
I'd feel really uncomfortable.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"I don't know what kind of work you do,",,INFO
"but there, there would be, even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"we have, we have a lot of people who work on the line.",,INFO
"I'm in accounting,",,INFO
"so it wouldn't,",,CAT
you know,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something,",,INFO
"but out on the line, they've got people working some",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
serious equipment.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
So.,,CAT
"It's, it's,",,CAT
"I, I just think employers have to have, especially given today, the drug abuse that goes on, I just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put at",,INFO
Put at risk.,,INFO
risk. *,,CAT
I agree,,CAT
Because,,INFO
totally.,,INFO
"they're the ones who are going to have the lawsuits, the insurance claims, et cetera,",,INFO
"and, and I'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to, uh, illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse.",,INFO
"And in the long run, we're all paying for that",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"so it, I mean, it protects us in the long run hopefully",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
when they do that.,,INFO
"I, I was trying to remember, there was a court case, uh, here where I live, just a few months ago.",,INFO
"The city workers, they wanted to, um,",,CAT
the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing,,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"and the city workers, uh, took them to court to protest, saying that it invaded their, I guess, first a-, the, the search and seizure amendment",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
and it's still tied up in the legal channels.,,INFO
They haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
So I'm curious especially since T I -s,,INFO
"To see how that's,",,CAT
"a local, you know, employer is also already doing it, seeing what they'll say about it especially since,",,INFO
"Is it, is it, uh, just a small group of the employees that are concerned?",,QUESTION
"Well, it's the whole, it's the whole city,",,CAT
seems like the whole group of city employees that's raising a stink over it.,,INFO
"They, they just don't want to be drug tested.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
So.,,CAT
"You know, we've never, my husband and I have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, my husband's retired from I R S agents.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"However, this isn't a problem that we have",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"either alcohol or drug,",,INFO
"and so, we, we, in our minds we're thinking what's the big deal.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's the way I looked at it.,,CAT
"If I had something to hide, it's one thing,",,INFO
"but I'm,",,CAT
"you know, you know you don't,",,CAT
"so it's not as big a deal,",,INFO
and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether they're really concerned,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"about their rights, or whether they're really concerned about something else.",,INFO
"And, and then they say, well, if you give them the right to do this, then they're going to take some other right away from you,",,INFO
"but I, I firm-,",,CAT
I don't believe that.,,INFO
"I think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything,",,INFO
"and, of course, the big deal, one of the big deals now, too, is to, that when you, come into a company, as you sign a paper saying that I will go take a,",,INFO
,,
"Well, there's been a lot of publicity lately about that new Nancy Reagan book out by, uh, Kitty Kelly, the unauthorized biography.",,INFO
Are you interested in that at all?,,QUESTION
Not really,,CAT
"I'm not much of a fan of Nancy Reagan,",,INFO
"so I, I don't particularly read, um, biographies or autobiographies.",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
I haven't read too many.,,INFO
"I, I'm more of a fiction and nonfiction reader that, n-, n-, not of that nature though.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well, I, the reason why I was thinking about looking at it is because it's supposed to,",,INFO
I'm not a fan of Nancy Reagan,,INFO
and so it's supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it.,,INFO
"And I thought just purely for entertainment, I might enjoy that.",,INFO
"But I, I wouldn't want to go out and buy it like, you know, the hard back copy of it.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But I might check,",,INFO
"If they, if they had it, I don't even know that I'd probably read it even if it was at the library though.",,INFO
Really.,,CAT
"I, I just, you know, I'm just not really interested in reading about other people's lives to that degree.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, unless maybe they lived a long, long time ago.",,INFO
"For me it would be interesting to find out what life was, uh, l-, like, you know, in that period.",,INFO
"But,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Not, not really interested",,INFO
In biographies.,,CAT
"Well, I, uh,",,INFO
.,,CAT
I have read some biographies.,,INFO
"I prefer to read,",,INFO
"if I read a biography, it's mostly because maybe I have to, uh, you know,",,INFO
"back when I was in school I had to have information about that person or, um, preparing some kind of lesson",,INFO
and I need to have more information about people.,,INFO
"But I, I do like to read some biographies,",,INFO
but that one just sounded like gossipy.,,INFO
"And I wouldn't want to sit down and just read it cover to cover, but flip through just for, just to get a good laugh.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think the last biography that I read, I'm not, I think it was, it was, um, on Lady Randolph Churchill,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Churchill's mother.,,INFO
And that was excellent.,,INFO
Was it?,,QUESTION
"Um, yeah.",,CAT
"It was,",,INFO
it's in two parts.,,INFO
"I think the first one is called JENNY or something like that, uh, because that was her name.",,INFO
"And, um,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I only got to read one part of it.,,INFO
"And I've been looking for, you know, the other half of it and read the,",,INFO
"I read that half where she was in her later years,",,INFO
and it was absolutely excellent.,,INFO
"And it was very descriptive of, of people with money back then and, uh, affluents in England, uh, that, you know, were associated to the king and all.",,INFO
"And it was,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
really pretty fascinating.,,INFO
"And I and that was actually a couple of years ago,",,INFO
"so,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"it's, it's been a while since I've read,",,INFO
A while.,,CAT
any biographies.,,INFO
"Uh, I love to read.",,INFO
"I mean, I'm constantly reading.",,INFO
"I read, I like, uh, mysteries,",,INFO
"and I like, um,",,CAT
"as far as improving myself, uh, I haven't read any lately.",,INFO
But I was reading classical works that I hadn't read before.,,INFO
Uh-hum.,,CAT
"You know, that you might have needed to read in school, but that I just didn't read for some reason or another, another, or that, you know, that you can only read so many in school that they make a requirement of.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And you have so many out there that, uh, that you, you know, you never get a chance to read.",,INFO
"And so, I said,",,CAT
"well, I think it was because I read, um, Dickens' A TALE OF TWO CITIES,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I just, um, that, even when I read it now, it still makes me cry, the ending of it.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"And I couldn't believe, I, I could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I'd read some Dickens before,",,INFO
but I hadn't read that one.,,INFO
"And I, I was like, I thought to myself, you know, what other things are out there that are, that are classics,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, that have withstood time and that are just excellent,",,INFO
"something's excellent about them, whether it's the way they were written or whether it was the material they were written, you know, that was written about.",,INFO
"And, um, so I started reading.",,INFO
"I had this like, you know, I had a binge of bo-,",,INFO
"my mother, uh,",,CAT
"I was living in Bermuda at the time with my husband,",,INFO
"but my, uh, mother sent me, you know, like bookl-, you know, uh, boxes full of different books.",,INFO
Oh!,,CAT
"And, uh, she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over.",,INFO
"But she, she is constantly, was, I guess because,",,CAT
"it seems like, uh, older people have much better, uh,",,INFO
"in their schooling, they, they got more of the classics than I did,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
you know.,,INFO
"And she knows so much more of them than I do,",,INFO
"I wouldn't even know, you know, to go look for that author or that book.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
You know.,,CAT
"Well, I like the classics too.",,INFO
"Uh, I think that there's a lot of books out now that are kind of garbage books.",,INFO
"And I, well, I don't prefer to read a lot of the things like you might find at, uh, well, like at a Target or a supermarket or something where they have a bunch of books out, paperback type books.",,INFO
"Usually, I, I'm going to the book store for a particular reason, uh.",,INFO
"Pro-, probably you read a book review or something.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
A review on it.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"and, and, uh, I buy some of the, not self-improvement books, but, uh, self-help books",,INFO
"like, we just bought a new house,",,INFO
"so I bought a couple of books about how to buy a house and what to look for, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, or how to repair this or repair that in your own home.",,INFO
I bought that for my husband,,INFO
"And, or how to, how to do something books, you know, for reference.",,INFO
"And, uh, and those are really helpful I think in helping, um,",,INFO
"well, you know, like some, w-, symptoms, medical symptoms, like when, how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"type books, which I use as reference and have been real handy.",,INFO
"But purely just for enjoyment,",,INFO
"I, I had a major in English and linguistics,",,INFO
"and so I ha-, have a lot of books in my home that I can read from the classics,",,INFO
and I do enjoy those quite a bit.,,INFO
"And, um, so I tend to, for reading just day to day, uh, you know, I have a particular book I'm looking for",,INFO
"or I just enjoy, uh, you know, the newspaper magazine.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It's handy.,,INFO
"Well, what I do is I usually have two books at one time.",,INFO
"I have a classic which I have to work on, basically,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"you know, uh, just depending,",,INFO
"well, some authors I can just, you know, basically drink in,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but others, eh , I really do have to work at them.",,INFO
"And then, um, whether, you know, they're a foreign author or whatever, um, or if it's their style or, or just understanding the material.",,INFO
"And then I, you know, i-, some of those, it's like I said,",,CAT
"it's like school,",,INFO
you have to work at it.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
But to me it's worthwhile in the end.,,INFO
"I feel good about it,",,INFO
and I usually remember those a long time later.,,INFO
"And then I have books that I read just purely for enjoyment,",,INFO
Light reading.,,INFO
you know.,,INFO
"I mean, yeah,",,CAT
"just light reading that are,",,INFO
"I particularly like Dick Francis books, and just some of the, the authors that are, uh, for mysteries, just, you know, just, uh, purely for entertainment,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
you know.,,INFO
"That's it,",,INFO
"I'm not really expecting to get anything out of it,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"except to be momentarily pleased, you know, because I don't, I can never remember,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"the plots or anything,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
later on those books.,,INFO
"Well, I think that's good because you do have to use your mind and imagine up the circumstances and things.",,INFO
"It's not like, uh, most television where you, you know, you just, you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
still understand what was going on.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that, television, it gives you everything.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, it's ber-, basically mindless.",,INFO
"I mean, all your, y-, the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you, you know,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"what you're hearing and your, your si-, uh, your sight.",,INFO
But they give you everything else.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And it's usually, the television that we see nowadays seems like that it's, it's, it doesn't even have some of the underlying, uh, things to it, you know, that maybe the old movies and things had, you know, the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Or, you know, like with Hitchcock or something where you're, you're, you're either expecting something or w-,",,INFO
"I, I don't know,",,CAT
"it just, I don't really care much for T V at all.",,INFO
"I just,",,CAT
.,,CAT
"I mean I sometimes get hooked into it,",,INFO
"but I really, I really get mad at myself when I do, because I r-, I realize fully there's no really redeeming value for,",,INFO
Not too much.,,CAT
T V.,,INFO
No.,,CAT
Not too much.,,CAT
"Well, that's right.",,CAT
"Well, I think it is good to, to read books and, and, because even if it's, like you say, it's light reading, you are still getting some, uh, mental exercise",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You're developing your imagination.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"You know, when you develop your imagination, that can take you into a lot of other areas, because you've developed, uh, your, your, your mind in, in seeing things, you know,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"even if it's your own set way, you know,",,INFO
"it's, you're, you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind.",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"So, I mean,",,INFO
That's good.,,G_G
"It's, it's excellent.",,INFO
"I, I'm, we haven't got children yet,",,INFO
"but I hope to, uh, set an example for ours that, you know, that reading is, can, it can be your best friend,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
basically.,,INFO
"I mean, even if you haven't got a, a f-, a human friend around, you can pi-, pick up a book and, and,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"be with somebody, basically.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I think so.,,CAT
"Well, I guess I'd better close now so I can,",,G_G
It sounds like your kids are doing stuff,,G_G
Or are you a teacher?,,G_G
"Uh,",,G_G
I gathered you might be a teacher.,,G_G
"Well, I, I was.",,INFO
"I'm home now,",,G_G
Oh.,,G_G
full time.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,G_G
"But, uh, so, yeah,",,G_G

"Phil, I guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work, or do you like to do it?",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, I, um,",,CAT
"about, or just over a year ago I bought my own house,",,INFO
"so this has been the first opportunity I've had to, uh, be working on my own lawn and garden,",,INFO

"I, I'd hate it, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Now, I sort of take pride in, uh, in the yard, and, you know, how the place looks,",,INFO
"and, uh, so I don't mind doing it so much anymore.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"so do you have a, do you have a garden,",,QUESTION
or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn?,,QUESTION
"Well, it's, yeah, it's, it's primarily just, uh, like landscaping a little bit.",,CAT
"You know, I've got some, uh, bushes around the fou-, you know, foundation planning, things like that,",,INFO
"and then there's some, just some little flower beds,",,INFO
"and my mom grows,",,INFO
"she's an avid gardener,",,INFO
"and she starts her own stuff from seed now,",,INFO
and she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the wintertime and starting them.,,INFO
"Uh, she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden.",,INFO
"They have a huge yard and a huge house,",,INFO
and so she brings them up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras.,,INFO
"Well, that's pretty good.",,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
"My, my sister is very over zealous, too.",,INFO
She's got some really nice flower beds.,,INFO
She puts a lot of time into them.,,INFO

this is the first time that I really have to landscape a house.,,INFO
His house is more like a farm house.,,INFO
It's not on a main road.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"My house is on a main road,",,INFO
and it has nothing,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, nothing.",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
about two thirds of an acre.,,INFO
So we each have a third of an acre we do.,,INFO
"Jeez,",,G_G
that's,,INFO
That's a lot,,INFO
"more than, that's more than the property I have right here, that you've got as a, uh, garden,",,INFO
that's amazing.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, it's my dad's,",,CAT
"and we've had it for ov-, he's been there for a long time",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"so, um, it just happens they built a shopping center next to it",,INFO
"Oh, jeez.",,G_G
"but, um, they put up a nice fence,",,INFO
"so we still have a lot of privacy,",,INFO
and we grow a lot of food.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I enjoy it,",,INFO
"um, the gardens are kind of old,",,INFO
you have to step down in them now,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"because we've tilled them so much,",,INFO
"but there's still,",,CAT
"we, we, my sister uses probably a fertilizer.",,INFO
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.,,CAT
"But I wish this phone would stop screeching,",,INFO
Are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line?,,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT

"Oh jeez,",,G_G
it's gone.,,INFO
"I don't see, I don't think my phone really does that,",,INFO

there was,,CAT

"I was beating on the phone going,",,INFO
Can you hear me.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I guess I was having a hard time there too.,,INFO
"I thought it sounded,",,INFO
"well, I guess we better stick to the subject",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"for the benefit of the people uh, uh, doing this work.",,INFO
"But, uh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"I mean, that's a heck of a pla-,",,INFO
"you must have a lot of different stuff you get out of there,",,INFO
"especially up in Vermont there, you should have, uh, some really nice soil.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"we grow a lot of, uh, the basic, corn, potatoes.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
She likes to really get into her pumpkins,,INFO
"and see how many she can grow. Bas-, corn, potatoes,",,INFO
"and, uh, acorn squash are good winter keepers.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, things the way we grow are carrots, cabbage, that sort of goes to waste",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, we eat it, we,",,INFO
just too much.,,INFO
"She, she starts her own plants.",,INFO
She plants a lot of tomatoes,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I let her do all the planting and putting,",,INFO
"and I, I do a lot of the, uh, a lot of the, the ba-, the back work, and stuff.",,INFO
"But she does, she helps me a lot, too.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
She puts a lot of financial.,,INFO
She plans it all out.,,INFO
Beans like to be near certain types of plants.,,INFO
"Now, they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like, uh, peas,",,INFO
I don't know.,,CAT
"Something,",,CAT
"Oh, really",,QUESTION
"because of like the cross-pollination,",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"it's just like, something like an onion and a tomato would go together, but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans.",,INFO
"I guess it's, it's just what scents it gives off,",,INFO
they just don't like each other.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"I mean, she, she reads all kinds of books,",,INFO
"so. I wish I knew more to tell you why,",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Huh. My mom put, uh, cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once,",,INFO
and the got cross pollinated by the bees,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
"And we ended up with these, these, like things on the cantaloupe vines that, I mean, were looked like round big huge round cucumbers.",,INFO
"Oh, that's really weird.",,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I mean, there, these were like some mutant.",,INFO
I've put my cucumbers down at one end of the garden,,INFO
and like I'll make an L shape I've put my cantaloupe.,,INFO
So they've been pretty close together.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
But I don't think the vines.,,INFO
"They don't real-, they don't have to be touching or anything,",,INFO
"like you say, they cross pollinate just by bees,",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"it's just the, like the bees and insects will do it.",,INFO
"Um,",,CAT
Either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something.,,INFO
Something weird.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"This year, this last season it was too wet up here",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"we lost a lot of our root things, our squash and our potatoes,",,INFO
and we got half our yield.,,INFO
"Oh, well.",,CAT
It was really bad because of the water.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"when I,",,CAT
"my family used to live in Littleton, Massachusetts,",,INFO
"and when we moved in there we had a, a really wet backyard,",,INFO
"and, uh, my mom wanted a vegetable garden.",,INFO
"So we trucked in, uh,",,INFO
"I think it was seven, what was it, cubic, seven yards, cubic yards,",,INFO
I think that's how they measure dirt,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"yeah,",,G_G
seven yards of sand.,,INFO
"I got to shovel it all, lots of fun.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I have to do that,",,INFO
"I want to make some flower beds,",,INFO
and I'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I'm going to,",,INFO
my problem is I want to use those rail ties to build up a planter,,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"but I don't know if the creosote in the rail ties is going to do something, you know, if I want to grow a tomato or something",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
in there,,INFO
"Well, it seems,",,INFO
"I mean, I guess it'd go with my flowers.",,INFO
"I've seen a lot of people use them, you know, for flower beds,",,INFO
"but I don't know what, whether they'd have creosote would do anything,",,INFO
"I mean,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I don't, I don't, I just don't think you,",,INFO
I always thought I'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but I don't think I could really eat the fruit off it without wondering.,,INFO
And I don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated.,,INFO
"Well, you can get, um, you can get pressurized lumber,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"but they put,",,CAT
"Oh, that's right.",,CAT
some kind of chemicals in there too.,,INFO
"there's even, there's bad chemicals in those too.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT

this house that I have is just a three bedroom ranch,,INFO

Um.,,CAT

if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
our company's a little tougher on the second chance.,,INFO

"if, if I do not find something that I really want or really want to watch, well, then I just do not turn it on.",,INFO
I would rather listen to music.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Part of it is that, uh, I think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis",,INFO
"and I think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in, sometimes they influence us",,INFO
and we do not know where that influence came from.,,INFO

"so that,",,CAT
"it's very successful for some of,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"those things,",,INFO

"or at least I saw a very bad example of having television influence your life, uh,",,INFO
"my husband had an aunt who was addicted to soaps,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, I want you to know that became the most suspicious, cantankerous, contrary old woman ever walked.",,INFO
She got you a,,INFO

"but she just got to the point where you could might near, you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and that attitude being demonstrated.,,INFO
"And for her to miss a soap, it was a big withdrawal.",,INFO

"I know that one day, uh, my youngsters were watching THE THREE STOOGES,",,INFO
"and I always thought that was just casual slap stick,",,INFO

Right.,,CAT
"I, you know, I distracted them, changed their interest.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Because I just could not tolerate that kind of influence on the kiddos.,,CAT
"I just wou-,",,CAT
"And, and you know we get it at school, too,",,INFO
"anyway, so you might as well not,",,INFO

"Sure,",,CAT
"I can,",,INFO

"Absolutely,",,CAT
"well, I did,",,INFO
"You know,",,CAT
"to, uh,",,CAT
I ran my kids to death,,INFO
.,,CAT

Really.,,CAT
"maybe we need to go outside,",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"so how'd you all, how do you,",,CAT
what's the best method?,,QUESTION
I don't know.,,CAT
"I, I'm old fashioned,",,CAT
"and when I got my, my dogs, when they, when they did something I hollered at them and threw them outside.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
They say that's not the way to do it now.,,INFO
.,,CAT
You're just supposed to,,INFO
Stand outside with them until they.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"just, just, put them outside, I guess. Unless you ca-, catch them in the act.",,INFO
"Well, we're hardly ever at home,",,INFO
so it's,,INFO

so.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
"you don't want to do that,",,INFO

"and, uh, you know, there's certain spots in the house where he likes to",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"go,",,INFO
"so, and he chews on plants and all that,",,INFO
"but, you know, that's natural",,INFO

by smell.,,INFO
How old is it?,,QUESTION
She'll be sixteen in May.,,INFO
Man,,G_G

"she's been our friend for all these years,",,INFO
so,,INFO
I couldn't.,,INFO
"we're putting up with all her accidents,",,INFO

"What, what's the deal,",,QUESTION
"we, we try to, we're trying to take it on walks now, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and so it, I mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to, you know, tug on it to walk it.",,INFO
"I mean, it just goes like a mad dog,",,INFO
"I mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping,",,INFO
and,,INFO
"Does it, oh.",,G_G
"it's, you know, I mean, it's not even close to even",,INFO

they treat them bad.,,INFO
"Well, you know, we went, we went to the junior college, Richland",,INFO

"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
"and, it, it, it's a pretty good class,",,INFO
"and they did pretty good, except this dog is,",,INFO
"she's just pretty,",,INFO
she's not smart,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, she didn't learn a lot,",,INFO
"but it, I think it calmed her down a little bit,",,INFO
and she's used to being around other dogs now.,,INFO
How long did it take?,,QUESTION
I think it was like a six week program.,,INFO
"Every, what?",,CAT
"Uh, I think it was one night a week",,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
"for like six weeks,",,INFO
"and, uh, you know, it was a group class, outside.",,INFO

"Well, Sheltie Collies are, you know, timid,",,INFO
"and they don't really,",,INFO
"unless they get used to something, they're really nervous",,INFO
and.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"they're, they're usually,",,QUESTION
.,,CAT
a high-strung dog aren't they?,,INFO

So.,,CAT
"Um, our, our friend has a,",,INFO
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
how do you feel about them?,,QUESTION
"Well, I keep trying to get away from them,",,INFO
I used to use a lot of credit cards,,INFO
"I guess for a while I would use, you know, a variety of the Visa and the MasterCard and the stores,",,INFO
"but I think I, I impulse buy too much with them",,INFO
"or I buy things, you know, I see it on sale",,INFO
"and I think, oh, it's on sale I have to get it,",,INFO
and I really don't need it,,INFO
or I really haven't budgeted for it,,INFO
"so, um, the last couple of years I really have tried not to use them at all.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
What about you?,,QUESTION
"Well, we have this philosophy, we use it when we go off somewhere",,INFO
"but we pay for it as soon as we come back, you know,",,INFO
"as soon as we get our bills,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
we pay it off.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And we only have one.,,INFO
We tore all the rest of them up.,,INFO
okay.,,CAT
"Because I don't like credit cards for one thing, you know,",,INFO
"I mean, they're okay, I guess,",,CAT
"if you're on a trip or something,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you don't have to take a whole bunch of, you know, cash with you,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"but I don't like using them because I've seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on,",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
chapter thirteen and stuff like that.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card, you don't have to pay for it.",,INFO
That's true,,CAT
"if, if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket.",,INFO
"Sometimes you may think, well, I don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"and it gives you a, sens-, um, a false sense of security or something it seems like",,INFO
"because you say, oh, well, I don't have to pay for it now",,INFO
"but you're going to have to pay for it,",,INFO
and it seems like ...,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you think, well, I don't have it now but payday will come and then I'll have the money.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Are you married?,,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"Well, I know that a lot of young people, you know, I,",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but now that she has one,",,INFO
she's only used it one time,,INFO
"but she wanted to establish some credit,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but I think it finally sunk in, you know, because she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them say, you know, well, I used a credit card.",,INFO
"And my husband's sister is the world's worst at, oh,",,INFO
"well, I'll just use the credit cards",,INFO
and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"You know, and I'm, I'm thinking woman, wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you.",,INFO
But ...,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
Besides the fact that how much interest you pay and then this ...,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
and people don't see that either.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"this thing that you thought you got on sale, by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time,",,INFO
you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"The only one that we, we have that we kept was the Discover card,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and it pays you to use it.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean, if you pay your bill off right away,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"if you don't ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it,",,INFO
"and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them any, uh, interest.",,INFO
"Now it's,",,CAT
"and people say, well, you know, I'm making money by using this credit card,",,INFO
"but they don't realize that if they,",,INFO
"I mean, it only takes one time for you to use it and not pay the interest,",,INFO
"I mean, you have to pay the interest, not pay it right off,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
that's going to take up what you would have made.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"So that's the only reason that we kept that,",,INFO
we debated for a long time,,INFO
"plus they don't have that, um, charge on it, you know,",,INFO
like ...,,CAT
Service charge you mean?,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yearly fee,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
They don't have one of those.,,INFO
"So, it,",,CAT
"we decided that was it, you know,",,INFO
"and, I mean, everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card.",,INFO
"We have, we could have credit cards running down our ears.",,INFO
"Oh, you get that stuff in the mail all the time.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"And then, I-, I'll have, just like , uh, department stores.",,INFO
"They'll call me up, you know,",,INFO
"and I'll say,",,INFO
"look, I don't want the credit card,",,INFO
"well, we're just going to send it to you, you know,",,INFO
you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to.,,INFO
"They'll send me any credit card,",,INFO
I tear it up.,,INFO
I just can't see it.,,INFO
"What I really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that I do have still,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that they send you these things that look like checks,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and they say, hey, you know, two thousand dollars, you know, free to you kind of thing, you know,",,INFO
all you got to do is go cash those things,,INFO
and you've got a short term loan.,,INFO
"I hate it,",,INFO
"I know it,",,INFO
and you know what ...,,CAT
I can't believe they have the nerve to do that.,,INFO
What's really bad about those though is just like,,INFO
"young people if they don't, you know,",,INFO
"we take the time to, you know, help my daughter,",,INFO
"she's in college,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but it, this is her first credit card thing,",,INFO
"well, when she got her first one she was so excited",,INFO
it was unreal.,,INFO
"Look at this they sent me this money, you know.",,INFO
"So then when I explained to her, look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest, and stuff ,",,INFO
"of course, she ter-, tore it up.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"But a lot of parents would not take the time, you know,",,INFO
and they wouldn't even think of it,,INFO
or their kids may not be as close as my daughter,,INFO
and I,,CAT
"are,",,CAT
"and, uh, you know, they may not even discuss it,",,INFO
"they go out and cash their check thinking that, you know,",,INFO
"they've got something,",,INFO
maybe they've won something.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"You know, somebody sent them something free.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And go out and spend it.,,INFO
"And, um, it's just unreal.",,INFO
"I mean, I don't like credit cards,",,INFO
"I wish that they would come up with some other way to, you know,",,INFO
"the only way you could use them is if you were, like on vacation.",,INFO
They would let you use it maybe once a year.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"You know, I mean, of course, I guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time",,INFO
"but, um, I have seen so many people",,INFO
and I have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen.,,INFO
"She got, uh,",,INFO
"I can't remember what she called it,",,INFO
"it's some kind of,",,INFO
"maybe it's sure or something like that,",,INFO
"it's something, it's some weird name of a credit card,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and she is charging out of her mind already.,,INFO
"And I'm going,",,INFO
you just got off.,,INFO
"That's how you got on to it to start with, you know, what is the matter with this person,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, um, it seems like people just, you know, they just think, well, I can just have anything I want.",,INFO
And I just don't see it like that.,,INFO
"Of course, I always see pay the bills first",,INFO
"and whatever's leftover, that's what you have,",,INFO
"but, um, maybe a lot of people don't see it like that,",,INFO
but I can't stand owing.,,INFO
"I mean, I cannot fully tolerate to owe something like, you know,",,INFO
I guess it's just because I've been brought up like that.,,INFO
"But, um, I could not charge to the limit and knowing that I was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to payout.",,INFO
"But, that's just the way I feel about it.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think it's, it's somewhat a, uh, symptom of our, me generation",,INFO
"and that,",,CAT
we think we need all these things,,INFO
"and I think my parents always, you know, did without or saved up to, you know, buy things",,INFO
"and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have, you know,",,INFO
like when I first got my apartment and I was setting it up I did try to economize some,,INFO
"but, you know, I was just like, well, I have to have it all furnished and I have to have all of my kitchen setup",,INFO
"and you don't, you know, do without too much",,INFO
"and, you know, that's how I got started kind of with setting up a household all up, you know, it kind of like, in the short amount of time.",,INFO
"You know, you just have to have these things just, you know, have them at home, have to have them at my own place",,INFO
"and that's, you know, a big expenditure to start, um, buying all these things that you think or, or have to have",,INFO
and actually they're kind of luxuries,,INFO
"or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"you know, going in one big swoop, save up and then buy it.",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
But we're not into that.,,INFO
"We're into like, have to have it all now.",,INFO
"oh, yeah.",,CAT
I guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that.,,INFO
"But, um, I guess it's because I'm older,",,INFO
"I mean, I'm not real old",,INFO
but I am older,,INFO
"and, um, you know, I didn't feel like that I didn't feel like I had to have everything.",,INFO
"I guess it was because,",,INFO
"well, I had everything when I was at home",,INFO
"but I, I don't know why I didn't.",,INFO
"Well, we're geared to that.",,INFO
"We're like,",,INFO
"okay,",,INFO
"like I want a living room set. And instead of sitting back and, and going, okay, well, it's going to cost maybe a thousand dollars, two thousand dollars",,INFO
"and I'll save for two years,",,INFO
uh-huh.,,CAT
"people go, oh, well, I'll just go buy it, put it on credit and they'll pay it off.",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"People aren't tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it,",,INFO
"they just put it on a charge card, put it on account,",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
and then pay off the bill because they want it now.,,INFO
It's always have to have it now.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, it didn't hurt you, did it, to,",,QUESTION
"I mean, you didn't go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything, did you?",,QUESTION
"no,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
but I have had some times when I've had some pretty good balances on there,,INFO
"and, uh, you know, I finally, you know, paid them all off and thought this is, you know, kind of nonsense.",,INFO
"So, we don't, uh, have big balances on them at,",,INFO
"all now we're, we're, you know, we,",,CAT
I use it occasionally,,INFO
but I pay it right off.,,INFO
We're ...,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, you learned then,",,INFO
right?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you learn the, you know, the hard way, you hate paying all that interest",,INFO
"and I've never been one to itemize on my income, tax and never had enough to itemize",,INFO
and so it's just a big chunk of money,,INFO
"and you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying, so much more for that item, because you've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what, forty dollars sometimes just to have the card.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"That's, a lot of money that you went to buy this item.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And then you never feel like you've got anything to p-, to put into savings or anything,",,INFO
"you're always just paying bills, paying bills, you know,",,INFO
you don't feel that you have any extra to save.,,INFO
"And I hate, I hate living paycheck to paycheck.",,INFO
"I like to have a little there, you know,",,INFO
"that I can, save",,INFO
"so I can feel that, you know, if something comes up I've got the money to pay for it, .",,INFO
,,
"My name's Mary Dell,",,INFO
"and I live in the Dallas, Texas area where there's a lot of pollution",,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
and I'm up in Wisconsin,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"uh, my name is Terry",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, in the small town we don't,",,INFO
"but, uh, we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollution.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"Okay,",,CAT
"I'll go ahead and start recording that,",,COMMAND
Okay.,,CAT
"Okay, um,",,CAT
just in particular here in the Twin Cities we have a lot of big corporations,,INFO
"and, um",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
I'm sure there's a lot of pollution.,,INFO
"We, uh,",,CAT
"before moving to Wisconsin lived across from where they were, um, gravel pits",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and also where they were making tar,",,INFO
and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar,,INFO
and,,CAT
Ooh.,,G_G
"it would, uh,",,INFO
"smell the continuous,",,CAT
"you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs,",,INFO
so,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and it was like miles away,",,INFO
but just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution,",,INFO
"and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that,",,INFO
but,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"also, um, where we also lived, too, it was very close to a highway,",,INFO
"so got a lot of fumes from, uh, trucks",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and cars,,INFO
"and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture,",,INFO
"I mean, it was",,INFO
"Oh, gosh,",,G_G
"on your tables,",,INFO
"you would dust every day,",,INFO
"and it was dirty, um, type of dust,",,INFO
"I mean, it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
um,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"for,",,CAT
"I live in a small, um, town now quite a ways from the Twin Cities, about an hour away,",,INFO
"and I may dust once a week,",,INFO
and that's all it needs versus every day when I lived in the city,,INFO
Huh,,INFO
so.,,CAT
"I'd never thought about that being a cause,",,INFO
I have to dust a lot as well.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"it, it comes right on through",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"through the screens,",,INFO
"the only way that you could actually live in the, in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house,,INFO
My goodness.,,G_G
and so it was quite a dirty city.,,INFO
"Um, if you were well protected by trees, which catch a lot of the pollution",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"then you're fine,",,INFO
"but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises, you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution",,INFO
and it's just going,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"for miles and miles and miles,",,INFO
"and it's landing somewhere with the wind,",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
That's kind of the way Dallas is.,,INFO
"We're so flat and open,",,INFO
"and I live in a suburb that doesn't have much vegetation, trees",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"it was all cotton fields,",,INFO
so,,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"we don't have that advantage,",,INFO
"and ours I think is primarily cars, where we don't carpool like we should",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
an airport.,,INFO
"I work in a building,",,INFO
I'm nineteen floors up,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I look out toward D F W International,",,INFO
and there's just an awful brown haze all the time,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I can imagine it's even worse for people living over near the airport.,,INFO
"Oh, sure,",,CAT
"sure,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"It's,",,CAT
"I mean, our air quality, um, in the Twin Cities is a lot better than what we've heard about California and",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"maybe in the other areas,",,INFO
"but, um, they were always talking about the air quality of today is this, you know, the ozone or whatever,",,INFO
and it's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"and many people are too busy getting to work, not thinking about, Okay, I could have carpooled with a friend,",,INFO
even,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"my husband was, uh, talking to some of the guys at work,",,INFO
"now he's, uh, fifteen miles away from work,",,INFO
"but he was talking, wouldn't it be nice to carpool,",,INFO
"and the guy says, Well, it's too close,",,INFO
it wouldn't pay,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, so.",,CAT
Want to meet my own schedule,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and,",,CAT
"those are the arguments we hear,",,INFO
"ex-, exactly, and so, my husband says, Well, that's fine, you know,",,INFO
it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, you know, the gas,",,INFO
"and, no,",,CAT
everybody has their preference to drive by themselves,,INFO
"or, if they do, they, they drive with one little buddy, uh,",,INFO
at least it's with one person,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but most of the time people are saying forget it.,,INFO
"I don't want to carpool,",,INFO
"it's too much of a hassle,",,INFO
it's too much involvement,,INFO
But we're,,INFO
"but yet,",,CAT
paying for it.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"we are,",,INFO
and I think of my daughter,,INFO
"and I'm sure you think of your children,",,INFO
"and you kind of say to yourself, what kind of future will they have when they think back and say, well, my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and maybe people are trying,",,INFO
"but they have to change attitudes,",,INFO
And it seems to me that it's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
than we had growing up,,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
you can really see it.,,INFO
"I, I had a chance to go to Bolivia a couple years ago,",,INFO
"and of course there's no industry, very little trash,",,INFO
they,,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"they don't even have that much that they burn, because",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
they consume everything down,,INFO
"Well, they,",,CAT
"to the thread,",,INFO
"and it amazed me,",,INFO
"I, I just had totally forgotten how ...",,INFO
,,
"Well, have you seen a new movie lately?",,QUESTION
"Well, uh, I am a student",,INFO
"and I have, uh, been actually watching more movies on video,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"than being able to go out to see, uh, movies at the store, or at the theater.",,INFO
"Uh, I st-, I want to see the FISHER KING and, and, uh, catch ROBIN HOOD.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"I, uh, I haven't seen either one of those.",,INFO
"Uh, what, what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though?",,QUESTION
"Uh, let's see.",,CAT
"Uh, I'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on.",,INFO
"Uh, WHITE PALACE which I thought was over rated, over hyped, um, recently.",,INFO
"Well, you're catching me at, it, uh, uh, at mind's end here.",,INFO
What have you seen recently?,,QUESTION
"Well, maybe you, uh, you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES.",,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
Yes.,,CAT
What did you think of that one?,,QUESTION
Enjoyed that quite a bit.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"Um, I thought the, uh, the cima-, the cinematography was excellent.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, the story was,",,INFO
"uh, though it tended to be a little one sided",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, it was good.",,INFO
"Uh, it was, it was believable.",,INFO
"I, uh, I just moved down, in fact, from South Dakota in, in June,",,INFO
"and that's when the movie was filmed,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, we, when, when the movie came out, we went,",,INFO
"uh, my dad lives in the state capital, which is Pierre",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and it was filmed right outside of Pierre.,,INFO
"In fact, the buffalo, the scene, the big buffalo herd scene, that was, that was a live scene.",,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"Uh, there's a guy that has got a, a buffalo farm,",,INFO
"and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and, and, uh, we, my dad has got a little plane, we flew over it all a-, looked at the buffalo,",,INFO
it was really neat.,,INFO
"But, uh, so we are watching the, the movie in the movie theater in Pierre",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, just every time I would start to get into the movie, and it was getting good",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"someone in the crowd would yell, hey, there's John Red Eagle, you know",,INFO
"or,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"you know, they'd start recognizing people.",,INFO
"They knew, they knew the extras or the,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, I kind of, I think I enjoyed it more when I, when I watched it on video cassette than I did, uh, in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that.",,INFO
"I'd go now, now which one could that be",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"and I'd, I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of, of picking up the overall,",,INFO
Scope.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Exactly.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, but I, I thought it was a good film.",,INFO
"But you are right,",,INFO
"I think, I think it was very one sided.",,INFO
"It, it was,",,INFO
"but it's a side that hasn't been told. Uh, as far as, you know, telling it from, you know, the Indians as the good guys and the, the white men as the bad guys.",,INFO
"I, I really thought about, uh, all the, the westerns that we have seen for years and years,",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"and it's just, shoot the Indians,",,INFO
and they are always the savages.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"In fact, I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night",,INFO
"and,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"it was a similar, uh, situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking a, an army fort.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, but it was an interesting movie.",,INFO
"Uh, have you seen PRETTY WOMAN?",,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
Now I thought that was a good show.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"That was, that was a good movie.",,INFO
"Um, it was just kind of a get away movie.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Kind of,",,CAT
"It didn't, uh, it didn't have any real social bearing",,INFO
"or,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"uh, and it wasn't really a comedy,",,INFO
but it was an enjoyable movie.,,INFO
"It was, it was kind of like the STAR WARS",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"s-, series, you know, just something a little different,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
yet believable.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"You're bringing it,",,INFO
"I don't know,",,CAT
"I had a, I sure did have a mind lock about the movies I've seen.",,INFO
"But, yeah,",,CAT
"I've seen PRETTY WOMAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES,",,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
"Uh, now are you, are you going to see, or do you, are you much of a STAR TREK fan,",,QUESTION
are you going to see this next one that's coming out?,,QUESTION
"Oh, definitely.",,CAT
Have you seen the rest?,,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
I think I've missed one.,,INFO
"I'm not sure,",,CAT
but I think I've missed one.,,INFO
"I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago,",,INFO
and they showed all five in a row.,,INFO
Was that here in Dallas?,,QUESTION
"Oh, they had it everywhere,",,INFO
"uh, every major city had one theater that did it",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
Because we had one here in Dallas.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"and they did it in Houston,",,INFO
"they did it, well, they did it everywhere.",,INFO
"And it was, it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed,",,INFO
"and the thing that I didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row, uh, time wise they happen one after another",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and just no, no time between them,",,INFO
"but you can watch the characters develop,",,INFO
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"Well, I haven't, uh, you know,",,CAT
"when the war was on I watched C N N and, uh, NIGHTLINE",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
pretty regularly and read the paper and all,,INFO
"but when, uh,",,CAT
"lately, like the last week or two I guess with Easter",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and spring break with the kids I, um, I hadn't been thinking much about the Middle East and what's going on over there.",,INFO
Have you been keeping up?,,QUESTION
"Well, uh, just really the last couple of days since this, uh, the, U N debate or whatever you want to call it that, uh, voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire.",,CAT
"I guess, you know, the thing really isn't over.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"They, uh, they had, uh, kind of, uh, I don't know if you call it standout or whatever",,INFO
but anyway they stopped and waited to see if Iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though.,,INFO
"As I understand it, from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the U N, uh, had set up, you know, the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
unless they're just absolutely forced to.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"So, I guess, from what I understand the thing could just",,INFO
Start up.,,INFO
"it could just, they could take off at any moment without, uh, you know, you know, any local, you know, congressional effort or anything else because, you know, it's not really settled yet.",,INFO
There's no official document signed or anything?,,QUESTION
Not yet.,,CAT
Not yet at all.,,CAT
"Well, I, um,",,CAT
"when the, when the crisis began last August I began to think well I, I couldn't remember things that I had studied in the past in school and all",,INFO
so I got out like my encyclopedias and tried to read about the history.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And it was really, what I felt was kind of cynical",,INFO
because it,,CAT
there just hasn't been any peace over there ever,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"In thousands of years,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I don't know,",,INFO
of history.,,INFO
"why they expect it's going to start this week, you know.",,INFO

.,,CAT
That's right.,,G_G
"And it just, it's just not people",,INFO
"they,",,CAT

there isn't any real Arab coalition because they do fight among themselves.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And they fight with each other,,INFO
"and they have such hatred for, uh, Israel",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"The, uh, the thing that's kind of interesting about this,",,INFO
my sons in the Air Force.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"And, uh, he came within a quarter of an inch of going, uh, to Saudi,",,INFO
he ended up in Korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in Lubbock.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
So he ended up going to Korea,,INFO
and his buddies ended up going to Saudi.,,INFO
"Well, he's still in Korea and his buddies home now",,INFO
"Oh, no.",,CAT
"He, he almost wishes that, that he could have gone home.",,INFO
And got it over with.,,INFO

"Well, I just,",,CAT
there's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, um, with,",,CAT
and that I'm afraid that we would have to stay.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"The thing, uh, the other thing too, when this all started if you, you know, if you did much reading on the thing, you know, Kuwait, the country of Kuwait was just, you know, somebody's uh,",,INFO

"and the, yeah, the British and the French mostly decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it Persia",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and part of it Iraq and part of it something else, you know,",,INFO
"and they, they split things along, um, geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into, uh, social or cultural things at all.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So, the country of,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"of Kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense except that it is an excepted place, you know",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"it's like any other country, you know,",,INFO
"for whatever reason it's, it's actually there.",,INFO
"Well, Iraq has had, uh, designs on that place since nineteen twenty-two",,INFO
"so, you know, it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And it's just that this was an excuse, you know, to make some noise",,INFO
"Now, something that I read in the paper the other day that I thought was kind of interesting was that the Arab, uh, uh, their version or vision or whatever the United States, now, is somewhat changed in that we won, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Now, now we are a, uh, a legitimate player,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"in the game over there, you know,",,INFO
"the, the,",,CAT
I don't think we can really understand their attitude because there cultures are just so much different.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"But, uh, we are now a legitimate player in the, in the, in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we, you know we defeated,",,INFO
you know Iran couldn't do it in seven years,,INFO
"and we went in and did in seven days what Iran couldn't do in seven years, you know.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
So,,CAT
Right,,CAT
that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit.,,INFO
It makes us more legitimate.,,INFO
"So, now what they're saying is that, well, since we won whatever we say goes because it's, uh, a kind of a might make strike sort of attitude about it",,INFO
"and, you know, we've got the power.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Which is why for centuries or hundreds of years the British and the French had so much influence in there,,INFO
because they'd go in and they'd win something.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And then, and then they could call the shots for the, you know, period of time until the next strong man came up and, you know",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and caused problems.,,INFO
"Well, I just, uh,",,INFO
I'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go and call the shots like you say.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"And I just would prefer that, I mean sometimes we've said let's keep, we're not interested in what other countries do.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And then other times we jump in and do things,,INFO
"and while I'm glad that they,",,INFO
"uh, I,",,CAT
"it was important de-, demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I don't,",,CAT
"I hope we don't try to keep, uh, in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to,",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
stay over there,,INFO
because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"That's, that's the, uh, that's, that's the big thing, you know,",,INFO
"we still got a little bit of the old, you know, Vietnam, um, problem, you know, in the back of our minds.",,INFO
"We,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"we got this,",,INFO
"we're, we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out.",,INFO

Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, this thing",,CAT
"they, they gave the guys, uh, the power and the material and the, told them to go do it and they did it. You know,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
got in and got out.,,INFO
"I'm not sure,",,CAT
"the, the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks I would think is, uh, you know, the, uh, the business with the, uh, the Shiites of all people, you know, in the southern part of the country and also the Kurds",,INFO
"because these people evidently are, you know, being killed off by the thousands.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And whether the, the United Nations,",,INFO
I don't think the U. S. will do it on their own,,INFO
"but whether the United Nations comes around and says, hey, wait a minute we know this thing isn't, uh, all that much over, we've got to go back in there and, and be sure that this large population isn't just wiped out.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Which is, seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I noticed that.,,INFO
"But, um, you know,",,CAT
"Well, I don't think there's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they,",,INFO
"Oh, well,",,CAT
expect. *,,CAT
No.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
.,,CAT
"there, there never will be.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, uh, uh, the only way that you're going to have peace over there, if, if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them,",,INFO
"you know, until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but I don't think we want to make that decision either.",,INFO
No.,,CAT
"So that's, that's a little rough, you know,",,INFO
"we're not, we're not quite up to that sort of thing.",,INFO
No.,,CAT
So,,CAT
"Well, I guess I better go",,INFO

"Uh, how, how,",,CAT
,,
You want to start?,,QUESTION
"Well, I guess I would first identify myself as middle aged",,INFO
"and therefore,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"having seen the last generation, I guess it puts me in, you know, gives me a perspective on that.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, I, am quite positive on the things that I have seen happen recently relative to women in, both in society and in the work place,",,INFO
"uh, there's no doubt about the fact that when I was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office, but not necessarily.",,INFO
"Uh, now I think the change that I've seen as much as anything is one where couples, uh, are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will, uh, have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I guess that's a significant change that I've both participated in an-, and noticed.",,INFO
"I agree, uh,",,CAT
"the equality of, uh, the roles now between the sexes, I guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war, especially compared with, uh, the Vietnam war",,INFO
and you see women going off to wars as well as men.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I have wondered why they allowed, or let, you know, both the father and mother go, uh,",,INFO
and the children are left without either parent.,,INFO
Now to me that's kind of a drawback.,,INFO
"But, uh, I guess it's a price you pay.",,INFO
"And I also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the, uh, uh, day care centers.",,INFO
Wonder about them in what way?,,QUESTION
"Well, uh, from what I understand there's been studies that, uh, these children are, uh, more rebellious.",,INFO
"Uh, they term it as more, uh, creative.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, uh, that they, uh, are much more contentious.",,INFO
"So, I, I don't, I, I guess we'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up, you know, in a, uh, kind of a, uh, community,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
rather than a home.,,INFO
"I have not, to be honest, had much experience,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
with children in that situation.,,INFO
"I, I guess one knows one's own storly",,INFO
"and I know, uh, in my children's case it was one where, uh, pretty much up until the older of two was in, uh, let's see, I guess basically starting junior high",,INFO
and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh,,CAT
"So they,",,CAT
"so I guess my experience is, is just with what we did",,INFO
"and, and so they didn't really go through the child care route.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
They were able to be home together.,,INFO
"Uh, and we never actually experienced that.",,INFO
"What, in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the, the next generation or so, I guess I anticipate, uh, an increasing equality, uh, greater presence of women in management roles",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, I don't know whether there will be an increased amount of, of surrogacy that we see.",,INFO
I just don't know.,,CAT
What do you mean?,,QUESTION
"Uh, deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Sort of rent-a-mom,",,INFO
"to be, you know,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"not to be crass about it, but, uh,",,INFO
That's strange.,,G_G
"uh, whether one might conceive, no pun intended, of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate, uh, uh",,INFO
"A nanny, sort of?",,QUESTION
"a professional mother, a-,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
person.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"For instance, that,",,INFO
"and I could, you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that.",,INFO
"In fact, I think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession.",,INFO
"That's right,",,CAT
that's right.,,CAT
"Uh, I, I don't have a, other than, than a reading and, and male perspective on, on the ver-, on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not.",,INFO
"Uh, I know that, that my sense is that I have very much an interest and had one in being a parent.",,INFO
"I, I don't know that I, uh, felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I don't have boys,",,INFO
"that doesn't, didn't bother me,",,INFO
never has.,,INFO
"Vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or, or as a professional nanny, nanny as you put it, uh.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of, say, taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"It would be a sort of day care,",,INFO
but it would be more of a family setting.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, I know that there are young people, characterized, I guess as being half my age, so that by definition that means,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"they're young. Uh, that, in my work place, who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman, uh, eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child,",,INFO
To come in and live with them?,,QUESTION
I could easily envision that.,,INFO
Pardon?,,INFO
To come in and live with them?,,QUESTION
"Or to put their child into a s-, into a home setting,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"where they would, you know, like they, they would get, leave at eight in the morning and, and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids",,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and you were paying for really high quality care.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures on, on the order of what I quoted to someone, because that's what the experience they want",,INFO
"and I would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that, that's a possibility of a change",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
that we could see in the next few years.,,INFO
"And then you might have more control over, uh, the, the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
I know the day care centers are not cheap either.,,INFO
"You know they're,",,CAT
I haven't ever really looked at them.,,INFO
"Are you aware at all,",,QUESTION
"Uh, well, no,",,CAT
"of, of what they would, what they cost?",,INFO
"I just know, I know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it.",,INFO
"They have to go with the, a single, uh, wh-, I mean a baby-sitter more, more or less.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But I think it's like, about sixty dollars a week for two children",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
if I'm not mistaken.,,INFO
"And you have to pay that whether you're on vacation, you know, and taking care of the children or if the children are at home, at home,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
sick.,,INFO
"I mean, that is, you know, just a, a rate that you have to pay",,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
"What, what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in American society?",,QUESTION
"Uh, I think, I really don't have a vision",,INFO
"That's okay, too.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I, I think that they will be more in the work place because, uh, the door's open.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, it's just human nature to walk through an open door.",,INFO
"So, and I would be glad to see that.",,INFO
"I hope I don't see a lot more single moms,",,INFO
"but,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"i-, it seems in my experience I'm running across single women all the time.",,INFO
"I'm, I'm noticing that, too,",,INFO
"and, and I notice the, the, a terming ex-, em-, emerging called solo parents,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"that I'm very aware of the number of solo mothers that, that I encounter in the work place,",,INFO
"and that, that is a little troublesome.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, because the pressures on them are, are,",,INFO
It's awful.,,INFO
"rather, rather formidable.",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"Uh, and maybe that's a change we'll see.",,INFO
"Maybe, uh, the possibility of, of women, uh, who deliberately say, no,",,INFO
"we'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
in the event of a separation or whatever.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT

that will be another big problem.,,INFO

because that's just so much of the way that they make their money,,INFO

right.,,CAT

I hadn't thought about that in a long time.,,INFO

"In fact, it's easier for me to say, uh, the types of music that I don't like are opera and, uh, screaming heavy metal.",,INFO
"The opera, yeah, it's right on track.",,CAT
"I like classical,",,INFO
but I can't deal with opera at all.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"And heavy metal, uh, it's noisy.",,INFO
"I'm into, uh, some industrial music that's, a, a bit even harder than that.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But it's, it's got to have a point to it.",,INFO
"Oh, I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"but, uh, the, the, uh, basic point of heavy metal w-, which seems to be music to annoy you,",,INFO

"is, uh, gets a little annoying.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
.,,CAT
What kind of progressive stuff?,,QUESTION
"Uh, lot of stuff that actually has, uh, ended up becoming popular like, uh, Nirvana and, uh, oh, you know,",,INFO
"I'm thirty,",,INFO
"so lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and, and the Sex Pistols and",,INFO
uh.,,CAT
"R E M, that sort of stuff.",,INFO
"Uh, R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being, uh, you know, ultra mainstream at this point,",,INFO
and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it's, a lot of people l-, like, saying that, you know, bands in that position, you know, sold out.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I think that's pretty much, you know, bull.",,INFO
Because R E M really hasn't changed.,,INFO
"If, it's, it's interesting.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"They're producing, uh, similar music",,INFO
and it's good music,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but, you know, people have picked up on it.",,INFO

That's good.,,INFO
I think it is.,,CAT
I'm impressed.,,INFO

"I was really tired of, uh, the Michael Bolton.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Mi-, Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he,",,INFO
.,,CAT
he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"And I could, uh, go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money.",,INFO
"Uh, but he picked the right songs",,INFO
and,,INFO
I guess.,,CAT
"and that that's about all he had going for him. Or still has, for that matter.",,INFO
"That, and a marvelous hairdo.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I'm sure that, that so-, that sold a lot for him.",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
in a thousand guises,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Well, i-, it's interesting because you were, you were saying that you liked classical music",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I like a lot of classical music,",,INFO
"but I also dislike, uh, some classical music,",,INFO
"and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music,",,INFO

"Yeah,",,CAT
"I can, I can believe that.",,INFO
"What kind of things are you, do you like in classical?",,QUESTION
What's the,,QUESTION

standard?,,INFO
"Stuff that I like,",,CAT

I tolerate Vivaldi.,,INFO

"Uh, uh, I like Tchaikovsky.",,INFO
"He can make a lot of noise when he's, uh, so inclined.",,INFO
"Oh, yes.",,CAT
"Uh, and some of, some stuff that I like, uh,",,CAT
"for instance, Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and that's interesting music,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"but it would not get performed by any, uh, municipally funded, uh, philharmonic,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"uh, just because, number one, it's Frank Zappa and he's weird, number two, isn't he still alive.",,INFO
"You know, we're, we're,",,INFO

"much better off playing, uh, Beethoven's ninth,",,INFO
"that's right, you know,",,INFO
"w-, we'll do, we'll do the ninth",,INFO
and everyone will know it and,,INFO
It's safe.,,INFO
and hum it,,INFO
"and i-, it, it just isn't chance taking enough for me.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Uh, I feel that, uh, that, that music should take chances in one way or another and that, uh, you know, if you've heard a piece, oh, a hundred, a hundred times,",,INFO
,,
Why don't you go ahead and start.,,COMMAND
Okay.,,CAT
Well I think the court systems could stand some improvement.,,INFO
"Uh, trial by jury is good",,INFO
"but a lot of time i-, a lot of cases, uh, is circumstantial evidence that, that convicts a person, which I don't think is all the time good. Because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent, I mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness.",,INFO
And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me.,,QUESTION
I don't know.,,CAT
"So you think if, if trials were held by judges or experts, that they, they would tend not to, uh, admit, not to convict people on circumstantial evidence?",,QUESTION
I think so.,,CAT
"You know, I, I attended a trial in, uh, Germany when I was a student",,INFO
"and, uh",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
that's the sort of system they have.,,INFO
"The trials are held by a panel of three, uh, three or four judges who are, well,",,INFO
they're like lawyers I guess.,,INFO
They're experts in the law,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and, uh, there, there really isn't a jury",,INFO
"and, uh, uh, they do the questioning also.",,INFO
The judges do the questioning,,INFO
"and, uh",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"they,",,INFO
"uh, i-,",,CAT
"I think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they, uh, uh, the judge is also sort of a jury, uh,",,INFO
but I'm not sure I like that,,INFO
I think I prefer the jury system myself.,,INFO
You think you prefer the jury?,,QUESTION
You think your chances are better?,,QUESTION
"Uh, well, actually I think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury",,CAT
"What, what I worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual.",,INFO
That's where you really need a jury of peers.,,INFO
"Well, that's true.",,CAT
"Because, uh, anytime th-, the government, uh, is the government against the individual you need som-, y-, you need the protection of ordinary citizens.",,INFO
"I think that's really the only thing. I guess where I would like to see the system change is, uh, uh, there ought to be a, a well",,INFO
"I guess I don't think that, uh, uh, juries need to decide sentencing all the time.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I think maybe th-, a judge is a better judge of that",,INFO
"or, uh,",,CAT
"Well, s-, sometimes the sentencing is still, is not fair.",,INFO
"I mean even if, well the jury, I guess they do decide that",,INFO
"but, but, I'm like you,",,INFO
"in a case like that, most of the time its,",,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"maybe I'm too, too, uh, uh, conservative when it comes to that.",,INFO
"Th-, the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, uh,",,INFO
"Well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent.",,INFO
That's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"But people who d-, don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are, to ask them to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see, I think that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"In Texas here, people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people.",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"Uh, it's kind of, uh, uh, a hanging jury atmosphere",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"But in a lot of places, I think people bend over the other way,",,INFO
"but I guess, I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it.",,INFO
"Some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that.",,INFO
Oh really?,,QUESTION
I kind of like that system.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"That's, that's not a bad system.",,G_G
"But I, I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, the thing is too, maybe they need more of a, I don't know, more of a expert types",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"an-, and call them in.",,INFO
And lawyers blow sand in their eyes.,,INFO
exactly.,,CAT
I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
Insurance cases and things like that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Where,,CAT
"and, uh, there would be more honest settlements instead of this, uh, tugging of people's heart strings and, uh",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them,,INFO
"Put-, putting on a act or whatever. *",,CAT
or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
Exactly,,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
"So. In, I think, i-, in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
,,
"Well, ironically enough I'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because I resumed an aerobics class the night before last.",,INFO
"Oh, no.",,G_G
I ripped the ligaments in my right ankle.,,INFO

Exercise is not supposed to do that to you.,,INFO

Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, well, I've been going to Spring Creek.",,INFO
"I haven't been to the Dallas one now in, oh, a couple of years.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"At least since they've redone it, supposedly redone.",,INFO
"So I don't really,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it-, well, it's not that great,",,INFO
and I go to the Spring Creek one on and off.,,INFO
But my husband's working over there,,INFO
and he just goes to the Dallas one.,,INFO
"But I just don't,",,CAT
"I mean, it's just so much weight lifting.",,INFO
Even the Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
Or is that what your into,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"well, I've used the Nautilus equipment.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And the bikes, and stair climbers, and stuff like that mostly.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I don't use the free weights,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
I like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I like those too.,,INFO
And the pool when it gets warmer.,,INFO
"And the pool,",,G_G
yeah.,,CAT
That's great.,,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
I know.,,CAT
"Well, what I did was I went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas,",,INFO
"and long story short, I hadn't,",,CAT
"this is really a stupid thing that happened,",,INFO
but they have like the gymnasium flooring,,INFO
and then like they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where I usually stand,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
in any class like that I go to.,,INFO
"Instead of having that level, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"they had a chrome strip that wasn't level,",,INFO
"and it was about four inches deep and then about, oh a seventy degree angle.",,INFO
"Oh, my goodness.",,G_G
And as we were jumping around or doing something I just jumped up and came right down on it.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"The orthopedist called it a, uh, basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you, and it snapped.",,INFO
Woo.,,G_G
I know.,,CAT
"We went to , well whatever in Plano,",,INFO
and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show,,INFO
.,,CAT
"And the doctor said, you didn't do anything.",,INFO
There's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you.,,INFO
"That was Tuesday night,",,INFO
and Wednesday night the radiologist called me at work,,INFO
"and, uh, I was on crutches,",,INFO
"and he said, I think you better call an orthopedist.",,INFO
So we went to one,,INFO
and he just put a big old cast on it.,,INFO
Put a big cast on it.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
for about four weeks.,,INFO
"Four weeks,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I like aerobics,",,INFO

"No,",,CAT

Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, I was real embarrassed,",,INFO
but I felt kind of stupid,,INFO
"Well, those things happen, though.",,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
they do.,,CAT
"I mean, I guess I'm glad, you know, that, um, nobody really noticed,",,INFO
I guess you could say.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Because I got up and started jumping on it again.,,INFO
"Well that did a lot of good,",,G_G
I'm sure.,,G_G
Yeah,,CAT
really.,,CAT
"I enjoy aerobics,",,INFO
"and I do it because I like it,",,INFO
"I mean, I like the music and",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
that kind of stuff.,,INFO
"I like the music,",,INFO
"but I've been unable to do that, because I hurt my foot about five years ago.",,INFO
I broke my heel.,,INFO
Oh,,CAT
"And, uh, *",,CAT
"that makes my foot,",,CAT
how'd you do that?,,QUESTION
In aerobics?,,QUESTION
"No,",,INFO
"no,",,CAT
"actually I was up on a ladder, and, uh, fell off.",,INFO
Oh goodness.,,G_G
Leaned the wrong way.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And when I came down I hit with my full weight on my foot, but on concrete.",,INFO
What'd they do for that?,,QUESTION
Did they have to cast it?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"they had, well they had to go in and do surgery.",,INFO
They put a pin in it.,,INFO
"Oh, so the aerobics, the impact, would not be good.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"as I permanently damaged the, the cushion under my heel",,INFO
"Oh, goodness.",,G_G
the normal cushion that you have there.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I can't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt.,,INFO
"Oh, that makes sense.",,G_G
"So, I mean, are you, in terms of other things, like, like, not running, but playing a little bit of tennis, or can you not do stuff like that at all?",,QUESTION
"Uh, well I haven't tried that.",,CAT
I don't know.,,CAT
It's been I bet it's been thirty years since I played tennis.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It's been,",,CAT
Mostly into just walking and stuff like that.,,INFO
That's probably the safer way,,G_G
because I notice in aerobics a lot of the women that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coro, coronary.",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
And there was my ego when I went ahead,,INFO
"and I went, oh, I can do that",,INFO
and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"half the time though I don't jump half as much as,",,INFO
"I mean, like, I'm real tall,",,INFO

"but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height, um, I'm five eleven",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
you need just take it easy.,,INFO
Sure.,,G_G
"Um, but when I see some wo-,",,CAT
"I mean, and I just don't think it's healthy",,INFO
all that pounding all the time.,,INFO
"It isn't, really, it's not really good for your knees.",,INFO
"So, yeah,",,CAT
"that's the other reason,",,INFO
"and, I don't know,",,CAT
"this was just, I guess, something freak that happened to me,",,INFO
"because I wasn't familiar with the,",,CAT
"Well, the floor was uneven.",,G_G
"Oh, it was completely,",,CAT
"I mean, it literally,",,CAT
"the two dissimilar floor lev-, floor coverings were not level.",,INFO
"And at first after it happened I thought, maybe that's a handicap access,",,INFO
"and then I said no,",,INFO

that's just the way it's constructed.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And my husband being a T I engineer,",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Do you like that, what that voice said, *",,CAT
do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to?,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"I like, I liked it because I want to,",,INFO
it makes me feel better.,,INFO
That's how I am.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
If I don't do it I just feel like I don't have as much energy.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And it's real funny because if you, you know,",,CAT
"it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you'd be tired,",,INFO
but it's the other way around.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
It curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
really.,,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
"but,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
and I need all the help I can get.,,INFO
"That gravity factor,",,G_G
I know,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
It does get you.,,INFO
"Like that orthopedist said to me, he said, don't worry Diane,",,INFO
"he says, he said, uh, you're at thirty something,",,INFO
but you're on the upper side.,,INFO
"He said that, don't worry,",,INFO
"he says, even if you weren't doing anything your body would start, that would start to happen to you.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
thanks a lot.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"because I was saying to him, I said, I'm not that heavy,",,INFO
"I'm not heavy, you know,",,INFO
maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I said, uh, why do I feel like I need to start pushing myself more.",,INFO
"And he goes, human nature",,INFO
.,,CAT
"And then, you know, you see these little girls in these little bitty things,",,INFO
and they're all like twenty-one years of age,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
But luckily at there's a little more diverse clientele.,,INFO
"That's true,",,CAT
they do.,,CAT
Except for the guys that lift the weights.,,INFO
They do intimidate.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I try to go real late or real early before they get there,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"There some things I'd like to try,",,INFO
"but, you know, sometime when I ask, I just feel like, boy, am I stupid or what.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Well that's one thing I like about the Spring Creek place.,,INFO
"At least the fellow that's there, one of the fellows that's there at night and on weekends is real helpful.",,INFO

And his name is B J.,,INFO
"I don't think I've ever, I think I've,",,CAT
there was some girl there.,,INFO
"I've been there like, maybe a dozen times.",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
It's terrible.,,INFO

and I'm glad they did that.,,INFO
"Um, you're not missing anything at the Dallas renovated site.",,INFO
It's not,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
at all anything worth talking about.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I thought maybe one of these days I'll drive over there and check it out.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"but if you don't live near there that's not worth,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I live in Richardson,",,INFO
"but it's about half way between the Spring Creek and the, the Dallas site.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"That's actually where this happened to me, out in, I say Plano,",,INFO
but it's all the same to me.,,INFO
"Richardson, over on Campbell and Park Hill there's a new recreation center.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And as we were doing it, too, everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities.",,INFO
"walked out,",,CAT
"I was one thing,",,CAT
"oh great, I have purple tights on, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And they're going yes.,,INFO
"But in general I like to exer-, I, I like dance a lot,",,INFO
so I mean aerobics is something I'd hate to give up.,,INFO
"But he, he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot,",,INFO
"but he just said to me, maybe you ought to try bicycling",,INFO
"or,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you probably will for a while, because it's going to be real tender.",,G_G
He told me eight to twelve weeks.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Not anything, you know.",,INFO
"I said, but you're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks.",,INFO
"He said, yeah,",,INFO
"but that's just,",,INFO
"they tried to put me in some kind of immobilized walker, because he doesn't like to put casts on when it's warm.",,INFO
"But I just,",,CAT
"the more they tried to get my foot in the more I screamed,",,INFO
"I couldn't, you know",,INFO
I know what you mean.,,G_G
adjust that.,,INFO
"You know more about this stuff than I do, obviously then,",,INFO
Not fun,,G_G
No.,,CAT
"Well, you're walking okay now obviously,",,QUESTION
"and you can,",,CAT
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"I have a slight limp from it,",,INFO
but it matches one if I have one on the other side.,,INFO

"So we're, uh, our discussion's about, uh, the care of the elderly?",,QUESTION
"That's right,",,CAT
that's right.,,CAT
"You know, what, what, uh, what do you think is important?",,QUESTION
"If you were,",,CAT
"uh, I don't know how, how old you are,",,INFO
"but if you had, if you had, uh, parents say or, or, or th-, grandparents, whatever it is, uh, who were ready,",,QUESTION
.,,CAT
"who, who you thought might benefit from a nursing home, what do you think you would look for?",,INFO
"Uh, well I, actually my dad's, my dad's almost ninety",,INFO
and,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
he lives by himself,,INFO
and he's in good shape.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, but, uh, some friends of mine have, uh, gone through this.",,INFO
"I think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and, uh, where they did some things to try to keep them, um, mentally alive.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And where there was, uh, caring and compassionate, where there were caring and compassionate people, uh, operating it.",,INFO
Do,,QUESTION
Huh.,,CAT
you have any experience with this yourself?,,INFO
"Well my, uh, uh, my wife's grandmother",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"is in a nursing home in, uh, Minnesota",,INFO
"and we go there, uh, once a year.",,INFO
"We see, we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston",,INFO
so we're pretty far away.,,INFO
When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And it seems, uh,",,INFO
"I mean the, the environment there, I don't know too much about it",,CAT
"but it, it seems nice enough.",,INFO
"Uh, it, it's hard,",,INFO
"at least half of the residents I would say are not, not mentally sound.",,INFO
"So it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to r-, to retain, uh, clarity, say, uh, you know .",,INFO
"From the lack of stimulation, you mean.",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well I, I don-, I don't know.",,CAT
"We, we also, my wife and I, uh, uh, volunteer to go to a, uh, nursing home that's just a mile from our house.",,INFO
"We, uh, she goes more often than I.",,INFO
"We used to go once a month, once every two months to visit some of the patients there.",,INFO
"And we'd take, we have a two year old son",,INFO
"and so we, sometimes we'd take him with us.",,INFO
"And, uh, there I would say it's the same thing.",,INFO
"It's, it's a nice, uh, relatively nice environment",,INFO
"but again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who are, who are just e-, e-, essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but, but, certainly, uh, certainly have ar-, ar-, are, have retained all of their, uh, mental skills and so on.",,INFO
"It's, must be depressing to, to walk, walk the halls and see, an-, and see all these other people who really don't know where they are.",,INFO
"Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with, that the people who operate it seem to have, what you'd perceive of as genuine concern?",,QUESTION
"I think, yeah,",,CAT
"I think they're relatively re-, respectful. Yeah and, and concerned that, in as much as they can be.",,INFO
"I, I think sometimes, you know, I've noticed, uh, people asking for, uh, some of the patients asking for things, uh, just repetitively",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, but things that are not reasonable,",,INFO
and so,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"at some level the, the, the, uh,",,INFO
"I'm sure that the, that the, uh, the staff l-, learn what's normal for this person",,INFO
"and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just, you know, is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It, it's possible,",,INFO
"I was thinking also that there'd be, there could be a fair burn out factor",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"um, in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes, depending on the person, not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I'll tell you one thing though that'll, that, that I, I saw that was really nice.",,INFO
"We saw a husband and wife,",,INFO
"we used to see a husband and wife in there, uh, together",,INFO
and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were,,INFO
but these two were.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And when you walked into their room, they had brought all their furniture from their house",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So it,,INFO
"And so,",,CAT
gives them a sense of identity.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
you walked in there,,INFO
"and it didn't look like, uh, you know, how, yo-, you, you walk into some rooms",,INFO
"and there's, it's completely generic.",,INFO
"There's nothing, maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person",,INFO
and that's it.,,INFO
"But this room, on the other hand, you know, they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that",,INFO
and they had all their stuff from their house,,INFO
"and it looked like, uh, i-, i-, it must have been,",,INFO
it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them,,INFO
"and it must also give them a sense of, uh, uh, security and, and, uh, and, and, you know, s-, s-, uh,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I think part of what you're saying matches what I h-, have read.",,INFO
"I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who, uh, were adequately deficient in their abilities, uh",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"physical or mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves.",,INFO
"But I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide, um, a lot of social activities.",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, the, one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities",,INFO
and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation.,,INFO
"Uh, and,",,CAT
Huh.,,CAT
temporary.,,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"that, that's, that's new to me.",,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"Well I think it, I think t-, it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there",,INFO
"and I feel like, the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like, like put her in there.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"And there, there's so much,",,CAT
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"Well why don't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask you what do you,",,COMMAND
"Do you have any elderly relatives currently in an, uh, nursing home now?",,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
I do.,,INFO
Do you?,,QUESTION
I have a grandmother.,,INFO
She's a hundred and two.,,INFO
Oh my gosh.,,G_G
She'll be a hundred and three in August.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And we decide not to put her in a nursing home.,,INFO
She lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town,,INFO
and then my sister takes care of her.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"She, even though she is a hundred and two, she still has all of her faculties.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
She still has her snap.,,INFO
She takes care of her own business.,,INFO
"This is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker,",,INFO
"but with somebody that needs around the clock care,",,INFO
I have seen my family age.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"I have seen them in the,",,INFO
she's been there ten years now.,,INFO
And I have seen them age twenty,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"in the time and, and with the expense and everything,",,INFO
"I th-, I still think it is worth it if you, if you had a good nursing home",,INFO
"and they needed some quality care,",,INFO
I would,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
put someone in a nursing home.,,INFO
My mother-in-law finally.,,INFO
They had to make a family decision.,,INFO
There's seven children in my husband's family,,INFO
and fortunately four of them live in the same home town,,INFO
and she has Alzheimer's.,,INFO
"It was getting where she was getting th-, dangerous. I mean",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"letting strangers in and things like this,",,INFO
but they were very fortunate.,,INFO
It's a small town,,INFO
and she happens to room with one of the doctor's mothers,,INFO
and,,INFO
"Oh, well that's good.",,G_G
then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time,,INFO
but she really doesn't.,,INFO
"Nobody thought she would adjust,",,INFO
but she has adjusted beautifully.,,INFO
"Oh, that is great.",,G_G
But then I am also facing my father who is very sick,,INFO
and my mother and father reside in Colorado.,,INFO
She's been taking care of him.,,INFO
I don't know how much longer this can last,,INFO
and at that point because he requires round the clock.,,INFO
He can't do anything without her.,,INFO
He doesn't know when to take his medicine,,INFO
and it's really sad,,INFO
"and I have thought if something would happen to my mother for, uh,",,INFO
my brothers are not interested in helping me,,INFO
so I would have to move him down here.,,INFO
"That way,",,CAT
I want to see the nursing home. If I have to put him into one.,,INFO
"You know, where I can go see it.",,INFO
"I, I'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado.",,INFO
"And,",,CAT
"Oh, why yeah.",,CAT
I am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"And some of them are limited care too where people can do, uh,",,INFO
"like they have apartment styles,",,INFO
but that wouldn't work for him.,,INFO
I think he is beyond that.,,INFO
"Where if you need help you can get it,",,INFO
but basically people kind of have a small apartment,,INFO
and doctors are available if they need them.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I, I",,INFO
"And allows,",,CAT
know a lady that lives in a place similar,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
to that in Austin.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, the only problem with these are that they are very expensive.",,INFO
"Of course, I guess all nursing homes there is",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"And the bad thing about it, before you can get any kind of government help, you just practically have, well you have to be a pauper.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"It, it takes every penny.",,INFO
They want you to spend every dime you have,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
before the government will pay for your your care.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
And that's the sad part about it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, uh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
and I think a lot of people who do it now.,,INFO
In Colorado it's interesting.,,INFO
I talked to my mother.,,INFO
They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home.,,INFO
And my mother could make it on that.,,INFO
What she probably would do is disburse the money to me,,INFO
and then I would send it back to her,,INFO
so that's what would happen.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I think that's what most people do.,,INFO
"You just have to give it, everything away.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It's unfortunate.,,INFO
"I, I work at a brokerage firm",,INFO
"and I have seen so many people that just have to gift, you know, their belongings",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It's frightening.,,INFO
"And I guess, uh, I don't know how old you are.",,INFO
I'm forty-six.,,INFO
"You know, we're the generation moving into this",,INFO
and I don't know how our kids are going to take care of us.,,INFO
I can't imagine.,,G_G
You know.,,INFO
I'm twenty-nine.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And everybody in my family has always had,",,INFO
we don't have any children.,,INFO
"Everybody that has, has them later in life.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, my, my mother and my father are in their late sixties.",,INFO
"So, I mean, they're not",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
that far away.,,INFO
I also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise,,INFO
and he's still living at home,,INFO
and I don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are.,,INFO
"Oh, I know.",,CAT
"And so, it's kind of,",,CAT
"you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations,",,INFO
"but it, something will have to change as more and more of us get older.",,INFO
"Uh, luckily, if we could be like your grandmother, I, uh you know, I would love to live to a hundred and two if I were okay.",,INFO
But,,INFO
"It,",,CAT
but yeah.,,CAT
you see these people in their seventies,,INFO
Most people aren't.,,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
most aren't.,,INFO
That's the problem.,,INFO
And that's the bad thing.,,INFO
I would hate to have lived so long.,,INFO
She lived by herself.,,INFO
"My grandfather passed away before I was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety, ninety-one.",,INFO
That's incredible.,,G_G
"And just did everything,",,INFO
,,
Why don't you go ahead and start.,,COMMAND
"Okay,",,CAT
"my hobby is, uh, sewing.",,INFO
"I, I've just, uh, started learning how to sew",,INFO
"and, uh, I've taken some classes",,INFO
"and I've made a few, few garments.",,INFO
Do you sew at all?,,QUESTION
"I used to, uh,",,CAT
Did you?,,QUESTION
"I, I sewed, you know, in high school",,INFO
"and when I went to college I think everything in my closet, I had made.",,INFO
But I haven't sewed since then,,INFO
and that's been fifteen years.,,INFO
"So, uh, you know, I didn't have access to a machine the whole time I was in college.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And, uh, my sister sewed",,INFO
and she needed the money so I would pay her,,INFO
and she'd make my clothes,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And, uh, and then just in the last, you know, ten or twe-, I just haven't sewn anything.",,INFO
"I would love to, I would like to get back to it.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, clothes are getting so expensive now in, in the stores",,INFO
"and the, the quality is, is sometimes so poor that,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, it, it really is worth while to sew.",,INFO
"It is, you know, an even back then,",,INFO
"I remember you could make something for, you know, half what it cost to buy",,INFO
"and, of course, the quality was just exceptional.",,INFO
"Right an,",,CAT
"Uh, now it's a little more expensive to make it, because, y-, you know, you start paying the price for the patterns and the material,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
but it's still such better quality that I think it's worth it.,,INFO
"It certainly is,",,CAT
"and the patterns have gone up tremendously, too, the prices for them, you used to could get, you know, a pattern for two or three dollars, now, they're like, you know, five, six, seven, eight.",,INFO
You're kidding me.,,QUESTION
"Oh, no,",,CAT
I'm not.,,INFO
See I can remember paying seventy-five cents for a pattern,,INFO
"Huh-uh,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
"the, the cheapest ones now are like maybe, f-, uh, four or fiv-, five dollars,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"six, seven",,INFO
"and then you get into the Vogues,",,INFO
"they get up t-, into twelve and fifteen and,",,INFO
Good night.,,G_G
on like that.,,INFO
"Well do you have kids and a husband,",,QUESTION
are you sewing for a whole family,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Uh, right now I'm just sewing for myself.",,INFO
"I, I do have two daughters that, you know, out, they're, they're grown now though.",,INFO
"I wish that I had started sewing, you know, when they were younger.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, it would have helped me out tremendously",,INFO
.,,CAT
"But, um, oh, I guess, I, I just, you know, I always, I have always tried to sew",,INFO
"and, uh, I didn't like the way it looked so I'd never wear anything.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But now I, I r-, have bought some, uh, new, sewing equipment.",,INFO
I bought the Singer machine,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, it really makes it look professional",,INFO
"and I've taken some classes here in, in, uh, Dallas.",,INFO
Well and that always is helpful for starters.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You know you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right track of where you're going.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
I know a lot of people where I work make their clothes.,,INFO
"It's just, there's just so many people sewing now days.",,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well do you do anything el-,",,QUESTION
do you knit or crochet like for sweaters or anything like that?,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
I'm not that talented.,,INFO
"N-,",,CAT
"see, I'm n-, I've not ever been a real craft type person.",,INFO
"I have a sister-in-law that, I mean, if it can be done with your hands, she does it.",,INFO
She makes things for the kids for Christmas and nephews and nieces,,INFO
and I look at them,,INFO
"and I think, God, you know, I, I should be able to do things like this",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"I have a sister that can, can, uh, crochet real well,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"or, or knit, I, I guess I mean knit.",,INFO
"And she knits things like hats,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and, uh, sweaters, an, you know .",,INFO
"Well, when my sister, oh, when my sister had her first, uh, child, my niece,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and this is, we're talking fifteen years ago. I was, it was my last year of college,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares.,,INFO
"So she did,",,INFO
"and I crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
and I started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that I was dating at the time.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And when we broke things off,",,INFO
actually we were supposed to get married when I got out of college.,,INFO
"So when we broke things off, I quit crocheting it",,INFO
"and I've never picked up a needle since then,",,INFO
"in fact, I think it's still sitting in the top of the closet",,INFO
"Oh, my goodness.",,G_G
One of these days I keep thinking I'm going to finish it because it would make a really pretty bedspread,,INFO
"But,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"now, now they have the, uh, knitting machines that will do it for you.",,INFO
Fast,,INFO
.,,CAT
"My problem, I guess is time, you know,",,INFO
"I, I talk to my husband,",,INFO
"we kind of planning for the time eventually when, you know, maybe I can quit work, while my kids, because, I, my kids are young.",,INFO
I have a three and a half and a two year old.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
And he says,,INFO
"but Bev, I think you'll be so bored, because, you know, all you've ever done is work.",,INFO
"And I said, but there's so many things I want to do,",,INFO
"I'd like to start sewing again,",,INFO
"I'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch and these, you know, knit these things",,INFO
and I think that would be fascinating.,,INFO
He kind of laughs,,INFO
"Are you familiar with what a Serger is, uh, the Serger Sewing Machine?",,QUESTION
I don't think so.,,CAT
"Well you know, in, when we used to sew, we'd sew the seam",,INFO
"and then we'd finish the edges,",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"and we, we would, uh, trim the seams and finish the edges.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well, this machine does it all in one step.",,INFO
"You're kidding,",,QUESTION
"so like as you're sewing the seam, it's finishing off the inside edge.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"and it's cutting off the, uh,",,INFO
"the, there, there are two knives",,INFO
"and it cuts off the, uh, you know excess seam allowance.",,INFO
Well that takes all the work out of it.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"And, uh, it, it really makes it look professional.",,INFO
"Well, how neat.",,G_G
"Especially, on, you know, I mean from the inside, you know how you look under, under something that you've made",,INFO
"and it doesn't really,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, uh, the Serger really makes it look professional.",,CAT
Well that's neat.,,G_G
They're pretty expensive.,,INFO
"I like,",,CAT
"I paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine,",,INFO
"For the machine,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, since I bought it and paid that much for it, I guess I'd be-, might as well get some use out of it.",,INFO
You have to learn how to do it.,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT
I'm going to have to do it.,,INFO
"Otherwise, they hold it over your head forever, right",,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
Now I bought you that machine,,INFO
.,,CAT
Well that sounds really good.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Do you paint or anything like that?,,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
Never.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and my folks gave it to me,",,INFO
"and, uh, a couple years ago when they, they sail,",,INFO
and so they sold their home,,INFO
"and they, they've been sailing,",,INFO
"and, uh, so it's here",,INFO
"but I haven't touched one like since college, so I kind of am picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do it again.",,INFO
"And of course, my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it",,INFO
"and I'd love to teach them to play, too.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, I'm not great,",,INFO
but I remember it.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
well I'm not that great either.,,INFO
I used to be a lot better than I am now.,,INFO
"I, I have played for, uh, the church choir,",,INFO

I played for the choral club in high school,,INFO

"You really,",,CAT
"You do,",,CAT
you do.,,CAT
"I never thought I would get rusty,",,INFO
but I'm rusty now.,,INFO
"Well, I, I figure it takes practice",,INFO
"and I, I don't, I say I don't have the time,",,INFO
that's not true.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"By the time I put my kids in bed at night, I don't want to do anything.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, you know, I've worked all day",,INFO
and I come home,,INFO
"and I do that,",,INFO
"I, and, you know, even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like that, I, I think gee, I could do this or that,",,INFO
I have an hour here.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I don't want to do them sometimes,",,INFO
I'm too tired.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"So, I try to save that for the weekend.",,INFO
I need to get better at it though,,INFO
"Well, sewing does take up, take an awful lot of time, takes an awful lot of time.",,INFO
Now the part about sewing that I never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out.,,INFO
"If, if somebody would lay it out for me, then I didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it.",,INFO
.,,CAT
I could do that all day long,,INFO
"and I, I can remember once in high school, I wanted some extra money,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and my mom wanted some pants,",,INFO
so she laid out the material,,INFO
and I cut it and sewed it,,INFO
and she paid me I think like two dollars a pair to make her some pants.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But I, I hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"on the, on the,",,INFO
make sure it's on the right lines and not on the bias.,,INFO
"right on the straight grain,",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
on the grain of the fabric.,,INFO
"and all that stuff,",,INFO
uh-huh.,,CAT
It drives me crazy,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"that, that's, that's the part that I don't like, too.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I like sewing, sewing up the garment itself.",,INFO
"I really like to do that,",,INFO
"but the, the cutting and the, all the,",,INFO
even the cutting I don't like.,,INFO
Well what are some of the other features on this machine?,,QUESTION
It sounds wonderful.,,INFO
Well that's about it really.,,INFO
"It's, it has four, uh, four threads instead of, the, the regular basic two threads.",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"And, uh, it,",,CAT
"Is that for designs,",,QUESTION
or is that for the regular seam in the fabric,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"you, you can either use three or four of the threads.",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"Uh, it's kind of, it the stitch is kind of like a knitting machine, like the, they're loopers under the bottom",,INFO
"and then the, there's a seam stitch",,INFO
"and it's the loopers that form the, the edge, you know that edge finish.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, that's what really makes it look professional.",,INFO
You can do a lot with the Serger though.,,INFO
"You can make, uh, piping and cording",,INFO
"and, uh, you can use all kinds of different, uh, textures of thread.",,INFO
So it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do.,,INFO
"Well, yes,",,CAT
"but you, you have to use it in combination with a sewing machine.",,INFO
You can't throw your sewing machine away.,,INFO
"Y-, you, you need it to do things like button holes,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, seams that need to be really strong, need to be done on the sewing machine.",,INFO
"So the Serger is not a sewing machine, itself.",,QUESTION
It's something that goes with it?,,QUESTION
"It's, uh,",,CAT
Like an attachment,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"it's, it's a, it's a, it's a machine,",,INFO
it's not exactly a sewing machine,,INFO
"but it do-, it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff,",,INFO
"but there are oth-, are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do. Like you can't top stitch with it.",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"You know, you can't do top stitching,",,INFO
"or, um, there's, there's a f-, few things that you just can't do with it.",,INFO
"It will also do a rolled edge, um,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Gee, it's just so versatile,",,INFO
"I rem-, uh.",,CAT
Well I'm going to have to go check it out.,,INFO
That's just something I hadn't heard of,,INFO
"but it,",,CAT
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"well personally, I don't have any children.",,INFO
I'm twenty-two,,INFO
and I'm doing my Master's at N C State,,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"so, uh, uh, children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now.",,INFO
"Well, no,",,CAT
"would they,",,QUESTION
no.,,CAT
"So what, what, how do you spend the time with your children?",,QUESTION
Well both of mine are boys.,,INFO
They're,,INFO
Um.,,CAT

"Okay,",,CAT
"and did,",,CAT
and they're into sports,,INFO

"I mean, as a matter of fact, that's what we're doing tonight",,INFO
"What, what are you doing?",,QUESTION
Baseball has started.,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"Do, do they play like, uh, like does the eight year old play baseball?",,QUESTION
"Oh, oh, yes,",,CAT
"we start here at, uh, five.",,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
"and, and in, in his league do they have like a pitcher,",,QUESTION
"or do they have a standing ball or a machine, or what?",,QUESTION
"Up until,",,CAT
"it's coach pitch, until you get nine",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
which my little boy will be nine in May.,,INFO
"So he's going to be with, uh, regular pitching",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"and my eleven year old, of course, you know, is pitching.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I used to play soccer when I was that age",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"up in New York,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"But yes,",,CAT
"we're into baseball,",,INFO
and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball.,,INFO
We even have peewee basketball here.,,INFO
.,,CAT
So there's always something.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and how about, how about like on the weekends.",,QUESTION
Do you do sports,,QUESTION
or do you go out?,,QUESTION
Both.,,INFO
If we're not doing sports we go somewhere.,,INFO
"Do you go, how about like for, uh, do you go for long vacations, like a week or something when they have school off?",,QUESTION
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"In the summer or like in the Easter time, like around now?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
usually in the summer time.,,INFO
And where do you go?,,QUESTION
Different places every year.,,INFO
"We,",,CAT
"Have, have you been out of the country?",,QUESTION
No,,CAT
"Oh, okay,",,CAT
"well, first, they always say, get to know your country first before you leave,",,INFO
I mean,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I, I lived in places, like",,INFO
"when I lived in Washington, uh, Washington, D C, I never went to the Washington Memorial,",,INFO
"and then when I went back to visit, I went to the Washington Memorial.",,INFO
"You know, I've heard, we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often,",,INFO
and that must be the thing.,,INFO
They really hadn't either.,,INFO
"They went to the Memorial, you know,",,INFO
"when they go, it's on business",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
it's not really just to getting to sight see.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Well, it's, it's a beautiful city.",,INFO
"Oh, I bet it is, too.",,G_G
"But, the problem is , like first time I went out of here, and they took me to Las Vegas",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and that was the most boring place on earth.,,INFO
"Oh, now my husband and I, we go different places.",,INFO
"But our child-, but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Did, uh, did, like, did you go to Disneyland?",,QUESTION
"Oh, yes,",,CAT
"yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"So, but um, now, I don't know,",,CAT
"but um, but let's see,",,CAT
when I was eleven I went also to the Caribbean.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"That, that was fun. That was, *",,INFO
"and, uh, then after that, I,",,CAT
"my sister lives in Turkey,",,INFO
"so when I was like fourteen, fifteen, I went, I went to Turkey.",,INFO
"Oh,",,CAT
"And this Christmas, I went to Turkey.",,INFO
"But basically, it's a,",,CAT
"for the past couple of years, I,",,CAT
"since my parents are, are, well,",,CAT
"I'm from Argentina,",,INFO
and my parents live down there.,,INFO
"So, all the traveling I do is alone.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, we were never much of,",,CAT
"uh, a very, uh, family thing, you know, made, like go skiing in Vermont or something.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"That was, uh, that was a lot of fun.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"But, what happens is we used to fight a lot,",,INFO
so there's never much of a family family thing.,,INFO
"You know, one of those hell family vacations.",,INFO
"Oh, yes,",,CAT
"but we try, you know, I try,",,CAT
"my husband also, we're involved in everything our kids does",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"because, uh, my dad died, you know, when I was less than a year old",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
so I always just had a mother.,,INFO
"So I always thought, when I have kids, you know, I really want to be involved with them.",,INFO
"Well, my dad, all he, all he wanted to do was get money for us,",,INFO
so he could buy us material things.,,INFO
"Material things,",,CAT
"yes,",,CAT
"that is,",,CAT
"yes,",,CAT
"And, and to me, you know, it's like, now I'm twenty-two,",,INFO
"but I still feel, you know,",,CAT
"it's like yeah, we never threw a football or something",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and the way I was brought up,",,INFO
"and he wants me now,",,INFO
"he, like he, you know, like he wants to be best friends now",,INFO
"Best friends, now.",,CAT
and it's very hard for me,,INFO
"because, you know, it's like you grow up to be twenty years old,",,INFO
and it's always the same man,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old,",,INFO
and he wants to be best friends,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"but, uh, you know, it's like, I can only express myself so much,",,INFO
"because, you know, um, everything that he taught me, you know, that my family taught me, which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say, I'm sorry, you know.",,INFO
"It's like, you know, I love you",,INFO
"and let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and so, that's that whole thing that he'll say when, like, like",,INFO
"I've seen my uncle and his family, you know, does everything together,",,INFO
"and you know, his kids are, you know,",,CAT
"when his little girl was five years old and everything, they, uh, they would go to the beach,",,INFO
and she could go to sleep at two in the morning,,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
you know,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and, uh, I was brought up the same way,",,INFO
"it doesn't matter what age you have,",,INFO
"just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning, you can stay up",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"but his, what he does is, when he gets home, he separates his work from his house.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
you have to,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, you honestly do.",,INFO
"Now I have friends that I love to death,",,INFO
"but, and they have children,",,INFO
"but their children does anything,",,INFO
"we have to take them, and, you know",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
to do it.,,INFO
And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while,,INFO
"because you're saying, Well, I work full time too, you know.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"but, uh, it's just, it's just something that, you know,",,CAT
"my theory is, you know, when, when you have kids and all you, you want to do, well,",,CAT
"what I'll do is, you know, like,",,CAT
"I mean, you might have problems,",,INFO
but it's not your kids' problems,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"oh, yeah.",,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
and you got to try to be with them as much as you can,,INFO
"and to, you know, like,",,CAT
"thing is, is, that, you know, like if, if they would ever happen to have a drug problem, suppose, that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying, I got a problem",,INFO
"Problem,",,CAT
uh-huh,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"and, uh",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time, you know,",,INFO
first of all you're coming to me,,INFO
"and let's see how we can get rid of the problem, you know,",,INFO
"and that's uh, that's very, that's very hard to do,",,INFO
"because once you're best friends with your parents, then, I think everything go a lot better.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
I agree with you very much so.,,CAT
"Now, we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college,",,INFO
"and we knew time wise, or, and money wise, too",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"would, it would not have been a good idea to had them then.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"my, my father was raising four ki-, oh well, three kids before he had me,",,INFO
"so it was, uh, you know,",,CAT
"you're trying, to support, uh, four kids,",,INFO
and it's pretty hard,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"and I, I told him, listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"He says yeah,",,INFO
"but then I wouldn't have you,",,INFO
"I go, yeah,",,INFO
but then you would have a lot of money,,INFO
"That's right,",,CAT
"but you can't take this money with us, though",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
that's how I keep looking at it.,,INFO
"But, you know, like, four, I mean fou-, four children is expensive, especially when you consider like, especially for me, which I'm paying out of state tuition.",,INFO
"I'm paying, you know, three thousand,",,INFO
"no,",,CAT
"what is it, two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And, you know, people say, you know, it's expensive to think it's college,",,INFO
"but, if, if everybody would be a little bit responsible, you know,",,INFO
"it's like,",,CAT
"what does it, what does it cost.",,CAT
It costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose.,,INFO
Now they go to a state college,,INFO
and they live at home,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"and well, it costs two hundred dollars for books,",,INFO
"but you know, seven hundred dollars a semester,",,INFO
"a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead, you know, like",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"if you cou-, if you can,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college, you know.",,INFO
What are you learning to be?,,QUESTION
"Oh, oh, excuse me?",,CAT
"What degree, I mean, what are you wanting to do after you get out of college?",,QUESTION
"Well, I, I'm doing computer science, computer engineering.",,INFO
"Oh, that's,",,CAT
"my husband's into, uh, computers.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and, and now I'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"because since I'm an international student, they want to send me back to",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Argentina.,,INFO
"Well, my dad wants me to go back.",,INFO
So.,,CAT
And you don't want to?,,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
no.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"because if you go back there, then you can never get out.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"Like you don't have any money to, to, get out.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"So, uh, and, uh, I was thinking, you know, like, Oh my God, you know, I go back there,",,INFO
"and then, and I get married there,",,INFO
"and now I have kids there,",,INFO
"and then I'll never leave the place, you know.",,INFO
Then you'll never leave.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I know,",,CAT
"and that's, that's what happened to my brother.",,INFO
"He came to school up here,",,INFO
"and then when he went down there,",,INFO
"he was just so bad off, you know",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
from not being able to stay up here that,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
his life just went down the drain.,,INFO
So.,,CAT
Well maybe something will open up for you.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I've been calling a lot of companies.,,INFO
"There,",,CAT
some of them are interested.,,INFO
"Well, at least for a year and a half",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I can work,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Well, may-,",,CAT
well I've enjoyed talking to you.,,G_G
"All right,",,G_G
same here.,,G_G
"Okay,",,G_G
bye-bye.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
Okay.,,CAT
What would you rather have?,,QUESTION
Or you want salary too plus what?,,QUESTION
What's most important to you?,,QUESTION
.,,CAT
"Well, as far as tangible benefits go I would say that, uh, health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"I feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care, dental and vision",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"as well as good long-term and short-term disability plans, uh, goes a long way toward satisfying my needs.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well, I'll tell you.",,INFO
I think that is the most important thing,,INFO
"I've, uh, I'm not working right at the moment",,INFO
but the company that I did work for,,INFO
"excuse me I had health benefits. You know, dental, vision, all that, pension plan, uh,",,INFO
"now I don't have that, although I do have a pension that I'm drawing from them which, thank God, I had.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"But, uh, man, I think those medical benefits are the most important. Uh,",,INFO
"You, you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical",,INFO
"and, uh, you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your, your compensation package.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, I should knock on wood.",,INFO
"I haven't, you know, had any serious health problems or anything.",,INFO
I've only probably been to the doctor a couple of times since I left work,,INFO
"and it was only for a cold, you know,",,INFO
"and they can't really do anything for you anyhow,",,INFO
so you might as well not even go,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"they look at you, say, well you're still breathing, so, uh,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right,,CAT
"Oh, you've got a cold.",,INFO
"Go home and take, uh, liquids and, uh, rest.",,INFO
Yeah.,,INFO
"But,",,CAT
.,,CAT
"uh, that is definitely, the most important.",,INFO
"Uh, pension, I guess, is next.",,INFO
"Uh, thank God that I had one.",,INFO
"I don't know what happened to the salary employees when, uh, the company went bankrupt",,INFO
"but I was union,",,INFO
"so mine was being put into a, like a trust fund, you know.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So, but I don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs",,INFO
"or,",,CAT
I suspect that it just disappeared.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's what I was thinking too.,,CAT
"I really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there, you know.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So where,",,CAT
what company do you work for?,,QUESTION
"Uh, I work for a little start-up company here in Pittsburgh called Trans Ark. Uh,",,INFO
"Um, uh-huh.",,CAT
Have you heard of them?,,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
"They,",,CAT
"we do, uh, distributive system software",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
for Unix based workstations,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"I, I worked for a trucking company P I E, nation wide.",,INFO
You probably heard of that,,QUESTION
"Ah, yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"In fact, my mom drives trucks",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Oh, does she really?",,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
"Oh, how about that.",,G_G
"So, yeah,",,CAT
"I see, uh,",,G_G
"after the merger, uh, you see a lot of Ryder PIE stuff on the road.",,INFO
"Well, you did.",,INFO
"So, did, did Ryder get out of the business?",,QUESTION
Is that what happened or?,,QUESTION
Well Ryder and P I E went together,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"and then, then that ended it",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
So that the merger pretty much ended the whole thing.,,INFO
It really did.,,CAT
"It's, it started, I think, a little bit before that",,INFO
"but that,",,CAT
"when P I E and, and Ryder went together, why that was downhill from then on, you know.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and the, the problem with that is, you know, when you leave a job, you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"But when, when the company goes bankrupt, I mean, the, they're just cut off completely",,INFO
and you're responsible for your own.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, and that's exceedingly expensive.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits.,,INFO
We could do that for eighteen months.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
But three hundred and fifty dollars a month.,,INFO
"God, that's terrible.",,INFO
It's definitely excessive.,,CAT
You know.,,CAT
"So, but anyhow, uh, and jobs aren't that hard to find, to get another one that does pay your benefits, you know.",,INFO
True.,,CAT
"And a lot of them that,",,INFO
"if you do get a job, they don't pay benefits.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"they're starting to, to cut back. Especially start-ups.",,INFO
"I know here at Trans Ark, we get, uh, we get health care",,INFO
and that's it.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean, there's no dental or vision.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And the, the short-term disability policy is, is a ninety day policy",,INFO
and there is no long-term disability policy.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"So, you know, at least in the case of this particular company, they tend to scrimp a little bit there.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, you know, of course, they can use the excuse",,INFO
"well, we're start-up.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right,,CAT
"But you know what's happening is the, disability plan, you know,",,INFO
so many people are lying about their things.,,INFO
"God, there's been big articles in the paper about that.",,INFO
"Uh, you know, they claim a back injury",,INFO
and then someone goes out and spies on them,,INFO
and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and everything else, you know.",,INFO
So I don't know what's happening and what's going to happen.,,INFO
"But, uh",,CAT
Well that certainly doesn't help matters any.,,INFO
"I mean, you, you get people who are willing to put their neck on the line to get you, you know, these additional benefits,",,INFO
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"cars,",,INFO
"you, you",,CAT
"maybe this is a fantasy we can to talk about any kind of car,",,COMMAND
.,,CAT
we want here,,INFO
.,,CAT
I want a Rolls Royce and a Cadillac,,INFO
"Hey,",,G_G
that sounds like a great deal to me,,INFO
You have great aspirations,,INFO
.,,CAT
"Well, let's see",,CAT
"I, we just bought, uh, a seventy-three Mercedes that we have restored",,INFO
"Oh, that's great.",,G_G
"I'm,",,INFO
"and it,",,CAT
"I'm a hobbyist too,",,INFO
I like to work on cars too.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
it has really been a lot of fun.,,INFO
"Uh, we found some guys that actually, you know, worked for a Mercedes dealership",,INFO
"and, uh, they also repair them for other the people on their off time",,INFO
"Oh, that's good.",,G_G
"so have, we, we have redone that thing from stem to stern, I mean inside, outside, you know, we've redone the body, repainted it, detailed it, so, you know, I really haven't thought much past that it seems like, you know,",,INFO
"I don't know if I'll ever want another new car again,",,INFO
"Was you,",,CAT
"why they, they didn't,",,INFO
you know.,,INFO
say buy it,,INFO
"they didn't necessarily say buy it new they just said,",,INFO
Maybe not.,,INFO
"what would you buy, you know.",,INFO

"yeah,",,CAT
certainly if it's an old Mercedes will be good.,,INFO
"right,",,CAT
"we, the one thing that, uh, we did decide as, it's, it's,",,INFO
we wanted it to be as authentic as possible,,INFO
"but we did break down and put a C D player in it,",,INFO
.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Well, that's great.",,G_G
"that's not quite authentic,",,INFO
"but at any rate that, that was one thing that I, one of the features that I did want,",,INFO
"I'd passed up on one and put a sunroof in it,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,G_G
"you all,",,INFO
I had to stop there.,,INFO
"done a lot more,",,INFO
when I talk about working on cars I sure don't do that.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, of course, we do it ourselves",,INFO
"but,",,INFO

"like I said, we were just lucky to find these guys that do it, you know,",,INFO
"they're, they just weren't really expensive,",,INFO
"Oh, that is good,",,G_G
"and, uh, yeah, you know,",,CAT
acknowledgeable people.,,INFO
"right,",,CAT
"and they work on it,",,INFO
"so, the things that can be done here they just come here to our home and, and work on it or work on it,",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
That's amazing.,,G_G
"yeah,",,CAT

"the engine blew up in it,",,INFO
"I had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, I, I thought what the heck, you know,",,INFO
we'll try something different,,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Well, I'm not a Ford person and never have been as a kid,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and, uh, I do like the V Eight engines",,INFO
"and I think the,",,INFO
"I went to the auto show with my daughter recently,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
down in Dallas,,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I, to me the American cars are far superior to the Japanese in styling, engines,",,INFO
Really.,,CAT
"right now, I mean,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"right,",,CAT
"I'm not saying that they were,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT

"I would that that there's,",,INFO
"I see a marked improvement,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,G_G

"Oh, yeah.",,G_G
"you know, even though right now I'm not driving an American car,",,INFO
"but, uh, I think,",,CAT
"I,",,CAT
"uh, you know, they said, they said what do we want to buy,",,INFO
"I, I'm, uh, seri-, not seriously thinking",,INFO
"but I, I would like to,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"put it in that category, uh, by a Cadillac",,INFO
"but I wouldn't,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
buy a new one,,INFO
"and, you know, of course, if I had the money I'd be happy to by a new one,",,INFO

"and, uh, she had a SeVille before that that had the odd backs that was,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,G_G
I remember those.,,INFO
"that was so, uh,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"and she, it final just wore out",,INFO
"they had, they had purchased it,",,INFO
"I don't, can't remember how many years they had that car,",,INFO
but she loved the styling of it.,,INFO
"That she may want to save, if she, she doesn't have it anymore.",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
she sold it,,INFO
"and she,",,CAT
"That,",,CAT
"since they don't make them anymore,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"she, that could be turned into a classic,",,INFO
I know.,,CAT
"in, in ten, fifteen years, uh.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
she kept telling herself that,,INFO
"and it's sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because my dad said well, just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it,",,INFO
I mean he came back with a new car,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"he wanted new one ,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"right,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT

"I'm still a full size person,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and I like a full size Cadillac,",,INFO
"I, I want one of those,",,INFO

"Yeah,",,CAT
or so.,,INFO
"it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again, you know,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"they had, they've scaled everything down so much",,INFO
"and, uh, I have, I don't, I've never owned a really large car,",,INFO
"I don't know,",,CAT
I think that Cougar was the biggest thing I ever had,,INFO

"you can't tell one Japanese car from the other,",,INFO
"That's true,",,CAT
"because they all a like,",,INFO
that's true.,,CAT
"you know, I don't mean that as a joke,",,INFO
"I mean,",,INFO

Yeah.,,CAT
and the,,CAT

"What is what,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"until I look at it to see what it is,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I think they have not, uh, lead the field in styling,",,INFO
they do have sports cars,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"but the price is way more,",,INFO
"you can get a Cadillac for,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"the same price as you can get a small Japanese,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"car,",,INFO
it's ridiculous now.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I know that, uh,",,INFO
"I've, I've sort of always felt like with Buicks it seems like all Buicks to me look alike",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"I guess it just, uh, it seems to me they're all the same shape.",,INFO
I have a very good friend that has a Buick Regal,,INFO
"and she, she's had, she's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it",,INFO
and that's what she's going to buy again,,INFO
"and I'm like, oh, please, it looks exactly the same as this old one that you've got",,INFO

"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
I suppose.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, if, if you're interested you ought to go to the next auto show.",,COMMAND

uh-huh.,,CAT
they were standard Cadillacs,,INFO
but they really looked beautiful.,,INFO
"Are they still,",,QUESTION
"are what they're,",,QUESTION
"what they have out for like the next year, is everything still pretty square,",,QUESTION
"it seems like the Cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really, I, I can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the Alliance .",,INFO
"Oh, no,",,CAT
"they have, they have convertibles now in the Cadillac,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
field,,INFO
"and they have that new, uh,",,INFO

"Oh, okay,",,CAT
"because I have,",,CAT
"Well, they have it every year.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
usually when I see the new cars it's during the fair when I go to the auto building at the State Fair,,INFO
"and that's usually when I see anything,",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
you know.,,INFO
"now this was, uh, in it was downtown in the, uh, Convention Center",,INFO
"and,",,INFO
"Oh, I see.",,CAT

"they had Japanese and German cars,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"they had the full range ,",,INFO
"and they had some, they had some new cars that weren't even out",,INFO
"they had, uh, a new Chevy Suburban,",,INFO

"it had a microwave in it and everything,",,INFO
"Oh, my word.",,G_G
"it was,",,CAT
they had several futuristic cars.,,INFO
"That's wild,",,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
you hear about things like that,,INFO
"and you think that can't possibly be done,",,INFO
"I mean, it just,",,INFO
I know.,,CAT
that's just too weird.,,INFO
And I like engines,,INFO
"they had a lot of broken down engin-,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"not broken down, I mean, you know, cut, uh,",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"displayed engines, you know.",,INFO

"so you could tell,",,INFO
see the inside of them or whatever.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"but, uh, that, that sold me in buying a new car, you know,",,INFO
"I mean, certainly interested in buying a new car",,INFO
"but again the, yeah, the American cars were for superior in styling and,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"new engines,",,INFO
"well, maybe,",,CAT
"and, uh,",,INFO
"somebody's finally woken up, you know.",,INFO
"I thing so, because they've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while * spelling - ""think""?",,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think that, I, I would definitely buy,",,INFO
"again there's the question are we in the market, uh,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and I could buy anything, you know.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"you know, if I could fine, * spelling - ""find""?",,INFO
"I, I was really crazy about Jags for a while",,INFO

"and I,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, thought that's a dream car,",,INFO
"and, and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant, you know.",,INFO
"Well, I haven't work on them myself so I don't, that, you know, my cars don't go to the shop, you know,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"so, uh,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
I am the kind of engineer,,INFO
and I've always done it myself,,INFO
"and, uh",,INFO
"Well, that's good that you can.",,INFO
I've got three of them,,INFO
"and, uh, I can't remember one,",,INFO
"I think I had one someone welded a muffler on for me,",,INFO
"Oh, really,",,CAT
"that,",,CAT
"in a years time,",,INFO
"oh, gosh,",,G_G
that's great.,,G_G
I think that's the only thing of the three vehicles that I've in it just the welding on,,INFO
like I said I don't do that you know.,,INFO
"I think it takes a talent to do that, you know,",,INFO
"my, my husband is, uh, engineer",,INFO
"but he cannot, I mean,",,INFO
or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it,,INFO
"that's might be part of it,",,INFO
"but, uh, you know, we just, I just say forget it we'll just take it in,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and get it taken care it.,,INFO
"He drives,",,INFO
"I, I,",,INFO
drives a Honda.,,INFO
"noticed that when I was a kid, uh,",,INFO
I was wasn't a mechanical engineer,,INFO
but I worked my way through college as a mechanic,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"I learned early from,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"fifteen on,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and dropped it for a long time when,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"when after I got out of college and,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
then picked it up again later on,,INFO
"and now again, I've got three vehicles",,INFO
"and I don't, I never get in them and just go to the shop at you will, you know.",,INFO
"Well, that's to, that's one thing that when you would consider,",,INFO
"see when I go out to think about a new car or buy another car, I don't think about, well, is this engine that I can work on or that, you know,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"my husband can work on or whatever, you know",,INFO
"so, you're, you're pretty lucky in that respect that,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I'm keeping V eight, V eight Chevy engines,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"because that's what I know,",,INFO
"That's when you know,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"and, in fact, I stock the same part,",,INFO
"I'm like a little stock,",,INFO
"if you,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"brought your Chevy to me I could, I'd probably have some parts,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"for it right now, you knows",,INFO
"That's pretty good,",,G_G
it's really been funny because we have like been you are own contractors kind of with this car,,INFO
"and when I say we have redone everything I mean we have done everything,",,INFO
"Oh, that's great,",,G_G
"and it's,",,INFO
I've always wanted to that too.,,INFO
"it's really been so interesting the people you meet because, uh, my husband Carl has called all over the country, you know,",,INFO
"he's gotten these catalogs try-,",,INFO
"it's really more difficult to find these vintage parts when you might think this is for a seventy-three,",,INFO
"Oh, I can imagination,",,G_G
,,
Okay.,,CAT
Hi.,,G_G
Hi.,,G_G
Okay.,,CAT
You want to start?,,QUESTION
"Um, yeah.",,CAT
Sure.,,CAT
"Um, I think, I think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back.",,INFO
"If you can't pay for it, you shouldn't have it.",,INFO
Period.,,CAT
"And,",,CAT
That is very true.,,CAT
That's just.,,CAT
"However, our whole economy is based on loans.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, uh, but, bet right this moment, you probably have several loans out",,INFO
or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something,,INFO
"Well,",,CAT
Master Charge.,,INFO
"I don't have a Master Charge,",,CAT
thank you,,CAT
"But, see our whole system is built on owing",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
not borrowing.,,INFO
"But, that's the problem, see.",,INFO
Our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that.,,INFO
"Uh, true.",,CAT
"But, uh, uh, without it, people wouldn't be able to own automobiles",,INFO
or they wouldn't be able to own a house.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
they would.,,CAT
They just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own. Or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own.,,INFO
"We might have to, you know, just be able to,",,INFO
"I think, if we, a generation went without debt, then the next generation,",,INFO
"like, if, if our, our generation,",,INFO
"my husband and I, we're twenty-eight, if we lived our lives and didn't become, you know, indebted, like you know, our generation before us, that, um, the budget would balance. And that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford, which we wouldn't be destitute,",,INFO
"I mean, we wouldn't be living on the street, by any means.",,INFO
"But just compared to how spoiled we are, we would be in our own minds,",,INFO
"but I feel like the generation after us would,",,INFO
"oh, man, it would be so good.",,INFO
It would be so much better.,,INFO
"It wouldn't be perfect,",,INFO
"but then, they could learn to live with what they could afford to save to buy.",,INFO
"And if you want a nicer car than that, well, you save a little longer.",,INFO
"Well, now I agree, uh",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I agree with you one hundred percent.,,INFO
I'm just taking the other side so we'll have a discussion here.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"Uh, but I still go to right back to what I said.",,INFO
When is the time you had fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile?,,QUESTION
"But, see, we made poor choices in college.",,INFO
"We took out two,",,INFO
"both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans, for student loans",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I look back on that,",,INFO
and I bought shoes.,,INFO
I went shopping.,,INFO
I did not need that money.,,INFO
I did not need it.,,INFO
I didn't need it.,,INFO
I shouldn't have even qualified to get it.,,INFO
I didn't need it.,,INFO
"And it would have been a little rough,",,INFO
"I might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli,",,INFO
but I did not need it.,,INFO
"And as I look back now, now we're paying that back.",,INFO
"I told my son, if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college, do it,",,INFO
but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans.,,INFO
Don't do it.,,INFO
"And I don't, I hope, don't think he'll have to do that",,INFO
"but, I just feel like if we didn't have those loans, we could have saved in the last five years the money for that,",,INFO
"and I believe we would have, because God's really put it in our heart not to get in debt, you know.",,INFO
"But we have friends in church that do this on a constant basis, that are totally debt free.",,INFO
And they pay cash for everything they buy.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Including new vans,",,INFO
"and, so, so I guess, I've seen it done",,INFO
"and I know you can do it, you know.",,INFO
But you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van.,,INFO
And that's where Americans don't like to do it.,,INFO
"And so and we don't want to cut back our services from the government, because we're spoiled.",,INFO
"Well, I have one way to suggest reducing the budget.",,INFO
What?,,QUESTION
Very simple.,,INFO
"Just take all these civil service employees,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and, uh, uh, take some of those holidays away from them, like Columbus Day, President's Day,",,INFO
I know.,,CAT
"I mean, they, they get all these days off.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Now give them,",,INFO
I know.,,CAT
"what a, a week, I think we here at T I get a total of eleven a year.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And that's about, uh, three or four less than civil servants get.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off, all those holidays.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that is true.,,CAT
Because I always think the mail never comes on these days,,INFO
"and you're like, well, what is it",,INFO
You don't even know it's a holiday,,INFO
"Well, now don't forget the mail is something else again.",,INFO
"That has nothing,",,INFO
they're not civil servant people.,,INFO
"But isn't it federal, in the federal budget?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
they have their own budget they go by.,,INFO
"But isn't it part of our income,",,QUESTION
it's not part of our taxes?,,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
It's not?,,QUESTION
That's why the price of mailing a letter keeps going up.,,INFO
"That's why it keeps going up, uh?",,CAT
"You know, I could",,INFO
That's another topic,,INFO
"I can remember the days when it cost only three cents to mail, uh, uh, uh, a letter.",,INFO
"Those stamps are valuable, now.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"They probably,",,CAT
"hey,",,G_G
I ought to go looking through some of my old mail.,,INFO
That's funny.,,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and that is a good short term thing, though.",,INFO
"That little things like that, that",,INFO
"overall, though, I just think we're just going to, I don't know, see,",,INFO
"I know,",,CAT
"I guess I'm kind of leery of this topic, because I know that Bush is real for the new world order. The one world government, and alleviating all, you know, national debt between all of the nations.",,INFO
"But I see that to be a potential power problem later, with, um, who's going to be in charge with this new world order.",,INFO
"And I, you know, I'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place.",,INFO
"But, I know, we already have a new money system.",,INFO
"We already have new bills printed, for,",,INFO
"the U S Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency,",,INFO
and I've seen them,,INFO
"And so I know that the long-term vision for the U S government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh,",,INFO
"but I'm concerned with who's going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about, you know.",,INFO
That's a lot of power for one or two people to have.,,INFO
"And so, um, I guess because I,",,CAT
"I guess,",,CAT
"in fact, I know what their long-term vision is.",,INFO
"I'm kind of like, you know, yeah, the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles.",,INFO
And I don't think Americans are willing to do it.,,INFO
"Well, what about, uh, uh, sending all this money overseas supporting other governments, third world governments.",,QUESTION
How do you feel about that?,,QUESTION
"I don't, I don't feel we should loan them money.",,INFO
"If I, I wish our leaders were really seeking the Lord on these things,",,INFO
"and if we feel led to give a country money to help them, fine.",,INFO
But I don't feel we should be loaning money like that.,,INFO
"I mean, it doesn't work, I mean.",,INFO
"Well, in so many cases, it's not a loan,",,INFO
it's just a give away.,,INFO
"But it's not, but it's not set up as a giveaway.",,INFO
"If it were set up as giveaway,",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
then they would never have to try to please the people at home,,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
"Boy, it is a big problem,",,INFO
"but I think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now,",,INFO
don't you?,,QUESTION
"I don't think that they, anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government.",,INFO
I know.,,CAT
It's really terrible.,,INFO
"I mean, there was a time, I mean where, I remember when I was real young, I just loved Harry Truman.",,INFO
I thought he was great,,INFO
"Oh, you know, I had,",,CAT
"some of them seemed like kind of, uh, heroic people.",,INFO
"Well I wonder if they really were,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"or if we just really didn't,",,INFO
,,
.,,CAT
"Well, here in Logan, Utah, we've got a nice little valley here",,INFO
and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in,,INFO
and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"Well, here in Seattle, uh, it's g-, the air's getting more and more polluted.",,INFO
"We're, uh, we're in kind of a basin",,INFO
"And, uh, Seattle is on Puget Sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains.",,INFO
"And, uh, there's been a lot, a lot of growth, population growth around here",,INFO
"And, uh, it's, uh, it's getting worse",,INFO
I think,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
most of it is from cars.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Definitely.,,CAT
"Here in Utah up along the Wasatch along the western side of the, of these Rocky Mountains here, where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo",,INFO
"and Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north,",,INFO
we get a lot of pollution,,INFO
and it's like seventy percent of it is from cars.,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"And, uh, it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion",,INFO
"And when we get,",,INFO
.,,CAT
get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above,,INFO
and it just sits and sits and sits,,INFO
and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of L A a few years ago.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"It's not, it's almost sad.",,INFO
"Because when I grew up here, it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys",,INFO
and now it's not in the mountain valleys.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I live in the,",,INFO
.,,CAT
university district,,INFO
"and, uh, uh, it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution",,INFO
"I think probably due to, uh, a lot of students going back and forth to school.",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
And then we're right next to Interstate Five also.,,INFO
"They're getting serious about things like, uh, mandatory,",,INFO
"well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties,",,INFO
emissions.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
have they started doing that yet?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"They've actually started doing it down along the,",,INFO
not in Logan up here cause we're doing a lot better.,,INFO
"We have a lot, population is a lot lighter up here.",,INFO
We have that here,,INFO
"and, uh, they're, they're expanding it to, uh, more counties here. Uh, as the population spreads out",,INFO
"and I think they're also going to be making it, uh, mandatory for more cars.",,INFO
"Th-, th-, there was, uh, something in the law about if your car was over a certain age, like over twenty years old, you didn't have to get it done anymore.",,INFO
And,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think they're eliminating that, uh",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"They're ge-, eliminating that out here.",,INFO
that loophole.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"They're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun. Where they're, uh, looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the, basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust.",,INFO
Kind of like a radar gun.,,INFO
And ...,,CAT
"Oh, really,",,CAT
You mean they could,,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
do that remotely?,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Do it remotely just looking at the, what they do,",,INFO
they do several different types of things.,,INFO
Sometimes they put a source light,,INFO
and they look at the source light,,INFO
"and then as the car goes by, you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it",,INFO
and you can look at the emissions actually.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
And ...,,CAT
Now where does the source light go?,,QUESTION
Like across the street.,,INFO
They'll set up,,INFO
"Oh, I see.",,CAT
like a trap or something like that in some sense.,,INFO
"And they're also looking at, uh, other, you know, ways of monitoring this and, cause they've found out something basically that, uh,",,INFO
"and a poorly tuned car can emit something,",,INFO
it's an incredible amount.,,INFO
It was like four hundred times as much,,INFO
Jeez.,,G_G
"uh, of certain pollutants, and it was like unburned hydrocarbons, then a properly tuned car.",,INFO
"And, and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars, well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the, the pollution then, you know, you, it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
That's neat,,G_G
.,,CAT
"But it's also been, uh, oh, you know,",,CAT
everybody is talking about using more mass transient here,,INFO
"but it, uh, it's tough, you know.",,INFO
"Like I've, I've looked into riding the bus to work",,INFO
"and I can drive to work in, uh, and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor. Which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But if I, uh, if I take the bus, it requires several transfers",,INFO
and it takes over an hour.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
So so it,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And they're ...,,CAT
"it's, it's not hard to see why, why I keep driving.",,INFO
"And you know, I feel guilty cause I'm driving a",,INFO
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"Um, what type of magazines do you have?",,QUESTION
We take several at home.,,INFO
"I, I take, um, SKIING MAGAZINE,",,INFO

"Um, so I take it that you like to ski.",,QUESTION
"Do you, do you, um, receive a lot of information on skiing through the SKI MAGAZINE?",,QUESTION
I presume that I do.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth, because I do get things",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"from ski associations and things, uh, at, during the year.",,INFO
"Oh, uh, and do you receive discounts and things like that,",,QUESTION
do you think,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Uh, not so much that, I, uh, more likely to see those at a ski show or something,",,CAT
but,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"um, I just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go and,",,INFO
.,,CAT
and new equipment that's come out and so forth.,,INFO
Some fashions,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
are always in there too.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So would this vacation you're taking,",,QUESTION
did you receive information from your skiing magazine?,,QUESTION
Probably not.,,CAT
"Uh, we already knew we wanted to take one,",,INFO
and we just started looking around.,,INFO
"I may have referred to a couple of them,",,INFO
but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"resort information, picked up a lot of brochures",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
and just decided to go to Crested Butte.,,INFO
We haven't been there before.,,INFO
"Um, that sounds nice.",,G_G
Kind of away from the crowd,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
is why we chose that one.,,INFO
It's,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
supposedly low lift lines.,,INFO
"But I haven't skied Utah yet,",,INFO
but I want to.,,INFO
"Oh, well, you need to come out",,COMMAND
I'd like to go to Sundance and Park City,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and some of those.,,INFO
"I understand Deer Valley is nice, too.",,INFO
"Deer Valley,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"they are,",,CAT
it's wonderful snow,,INFO
"Well, how about you,",,QUESTION
"what, what magazines do you have at home?",,QUESTION
"Uh, I am currently taking DECORATIVE WOODWORKING, and, uh, COUNTRY LIVING,",,INFO
"and, let's see, we do have NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC,",,INFO
"and then we have some church magazines,",,INFO
but I really enjoy the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING.,,INFO
"I'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that,",,INFO
so,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a great, great help.",,INFO
"Does it have, uh, articles on how to do things",,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth?,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"they do have, uh, mostly they have, uh, the ads on the equipment,",,INFO
"but the whole magazine is just filled with, uh, pictures and projects that you can make yourself,",,INFO
"and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project, and, and then how to paint it with the tole paintings,",,INFO
"and so, it's really a fun one.",,INFO
I like that.,,INFO
"Well, that's good.",,G_G
It's good to get use out of one.,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"I'm not sure that, um, in the case of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC,",,CAT
"I mean, I read it,",,INFO
but then they just sort of gather dust for a,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"long period of time,",,INFO
but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"you know, France or something or whatever it is",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
he's looking for.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"I've, I've noticed that, too,",,CAT
but they have been nice to have around.,,INFO
Every once in a while they come in handy,,INFO
I used to take SMITHSONIAN,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"too,",,INFO
I liked that magazine,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but it was, I was, just found myself not ever getting around to reading it.",,INFO
Oh. Uh.,,CAT
"You get so many coming in,",,INFO
and by the time the next round comes in I'm still not through reading the first round.,,INFO
"Oh, that.",,CAT
"Oh, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house, too, I forgot,",,INFO
and that's,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"mostly my son's,",,INFO
but,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but I do read it, too.",,INFO
"Oh, well that sounds like.",,CAT
And he takes GAMES MAGAZINE,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"GAME MAGAZINE, which has puzzles and things",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"that he likes to solve, you know, crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"he likes to try that,",,INFO
"so. He does, uh, does get to be a lot of paper though,",,INFO
after a while,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"if you don't keep them weeded out, they almost take over.",,INFO
"They do, they can do that.",,CAT
"I found that they've been fun for my little girls,",,INFO
"they're five and four years old,",,INFO
and they like to go through,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
they're just kind of getting started now.,,QUESTION
"Uh-huh. They like to cut the pictures out and paste them on,",,CAT
and so we've found good use for those.,,INFO
"Mine is a senior in high school,",,INFO
"so he's, we're kind of at the end of that trail.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
You're just,,QUESTION
Oh.,,CAT
sort of beginning,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
to think about first grade.,,INFO
.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
it's fun.,,INFO
"Well, I do have a boy in junior high, too,",,INFO
so,,CAT
"Oh, okay,",,CAT
"so you got a little bit of a gap there between,",,INFO
so we're kind of running the gamut,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
,,
"Hi, Maureen.",,G_G
How are you?,,G_G
All right.,,G_G
Well do you have a family budget?,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"we probably should,",,INFO
but we haven't.,,INFO
"So why don't you explain to me some good tips about what you've done, which you've found useful and workable.",,COMMAND
Okay.,,CAT
"We do a few things,",,INFO
"and I have to say we're, my husband and I are both from financial backgrounds.",,INFO
"I, I'm an accountant.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, he has an M B A,",,INFO
"so, uh, we were sort of, you know, keyed in on expenses and things like that.",,INFO
So,,CAT
"Um, okay.",,CAT
"Um, coming from that background, what we pretty much do is we, in our household, as far as living expenses, we live on a cash budget.",,INFO
"Every month, my husband, uh, goes to the credit union and withdraws, you know, X amount of dollars for the month,",,INFO
and then that money is used during that month.,,INFO
We have a certain budget.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Excuse me. For instance, I control all the household expenses, the groceries, uh, the haircuts, the gasoline for my car, any miscellaneous expenses, baby-sitting, things like that.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, excuse me, if, uh, it comes the end of the month and I don't have any money, uh, we don't buy any more milk",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
.,,CAT
"But, uh, we've gotten pretty good at it,",,INFO
we've been doing it a couple of years now.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, we, our budgets are realistic",,INFO
"and they are not so stringent and, you know to make us feel uncomfortable.",,INFO
Hm.,,CAT
"And I, I really try to stretch my, my dollars here and there, shopping, uh, at warehouses sometimes, like at Sam's and things like that.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, uh, we live, we live on, on a cash budget",,INFO
"and it, sometimes it's tight come the end of the month,",,INFO
"but generally, we always make it.",,INFO
"What do you do for the surprise things that you don't necessarily plan for,",,QUESTION
"the, you know are sometimes several hundred dollars, like, uh, tires for the car or car repair of some sort,",,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
"or, like a, a dental bill or something that you're not prepared for?",,INFO
"Well, uh, most of our medical things, we don't, uh, have to worry about, because of insurance",,INFO
"and they're, they're relatively small.",,INFO
"Uh, we've been lucky.",,INFO
In the past we didn't have that problem,,INFO
but right now we don't.,,INFO
"For the other things, the things that crop up, that we aren't really expecting, we have different funds set aside for different things.",,INFO
Like we have a car fund,,INFO
and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"So, I mean,",,CAT
"and I, I can't really remember what it is.",,INFO
"Do you kind of continue, call this like, a part of savings account or a different savings account",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
It's all part of the savings account.,,INFO
We just keep track of it on paper.,,INFO
"Uh, you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account.",,INFO
"We decide, okay, you know, let's say it's a hundred dollars.",,INFO
"You know, every month fifteen dollars is for car fund. You know,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
Ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever.,,INFO
"Uh, and we just, we constantly do that, so that there's a buildup of money for those things if something does come up.",,INFO
Like I know that my washing machine is going to go any day.,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"So, but, we have the money set aside,",,INFO
so if it does it's not going to kill us.,,INFO
Hm.,,CAT
"Uh, so we're, we're actually, we're pretty disciplined,",,INFO
so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through.,,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
"then, so like your pay, what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that, you know, will cover all of the expenses, kind of thing?",,QUESTION
"Well, in.",,CAT
"Or like what, what percent, do you then save or something?",,QUESTION
"Uh, we have a lot of different things.",,INFO
"Right now, we save about twenty-five percent of our, of our pay.",,INFO
"Hm, okay.",,CAT
"It, and it goes toward different things,",,INFO
"it's for, you know, for vacations like I said, for, you know, emergencies like for car, uh, breaks down, something like that.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, and we also put money aside for our kids college.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Neither of us had any help with our college degrees,",,INFO
and just this last month we paid off my final school loan.,,INFO
So,,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
We're starting our kids a little bit early.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"Do you, uh, use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things?",,QUESTION
"Checking account a lot, uh, not so much credit cards.",,INFO
"Now several years back I used to use ch-, uh, charge cards, and you know all the time, kind of thinking, oh, well it's on sale, you know, it must be a good deal.",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
There have been times that I have been bad about the credit cards,,CAT
"and so pretty much now, uh, we don't use them too much.",,INFO
"If we travel or something, yeah. But, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Standard, we usually don't.",,INFO
"Or if it, it is a purchase, uh, then it's paid off when the bill comes.",,INFO
"You know, so it isn't any extended, uh,",,INFO
"it may be that I picked up something at the store,",,INFO
"but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then,",,INFO
"so it's not any, you know, uh, build up on the charge cards at all.",,INFO
That's good.,,G_G
"And, but that hasn't always been the case",,INFO
"So, I'm kind of,",,CAT
"I feel at least better now that I have finally gotten some of those things, uh, you know, in the past,",,INFO
"and I don't have, you know, big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards, because that interest rate just is a killer.",,INFO
"Oh, and it's not deductible anymore.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, I've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow.",,INFO
"But, uh, pretty much when I always, I go to the grocery store or something I just always write checks.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"We did, we did that for a long time",,INFO
and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things.,,INFO
Hm.,,CAT
"And it seemed like we didn't have enough money when things cropped up, you know,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget.,,INFO
"Well the first time we did it, we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and then we kept track of everything for a month.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, how much we spent on food, how much we spent on gasoline, how much we spent on everything,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and from that built, you know, a cash budget.",,INFO
"So now, I mean, I have,",,CAT
"I don't remember what it is now, four hundred dollars for the month, let's say.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, I mean some months I may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else,",,INFO
and some months it may be different.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"It's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves, you know, down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing,",,INFO
"but the way we set up, you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for, you know, uh, utilities and, uh, the house payment and all that.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
those are things you don't really have much control over.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, the cash budget just fits right in there",,INFO
"like I said if we don't have, we also set aside money for entertainment.",,INFO
"I mean, but again it's a set amount every month.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, on special occasions, I mean birthdays and things like that.",,INFO
"We, we don't, we still have fun on things",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, we are in the process of trying to buy a house,",,INFO
"do you know, how did your budget work",,QUESTION
"or did you have a budget to, uh, get your down payment going to get a house?",,QUESTION
"Well, no",,CAT
"not originally, because when we, we did buy, when we bought our first house, it was at a time where you",,INFO
"and the kind of loan we got, you really didn't have to put down anything.",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"So, we got into it fairly cheaply,",,INFO
"and then, uh, after we sold the first house, we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house.",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"So, we, we got out of that one pretty easily",,INFO
"Okay, uh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
I just keep thinking all the time,,INFO
"I mean, it, it's really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your, you know, your priority, at least mine is to save for the house.",,INFO
"But then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long, long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment.",,INFO
You feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime.,,INFO
"Sure,",,CAT
I know.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"That's how I feel sometimes about my kids' education,",,INFO
"I mean jeez, they are one and four",,INFO
.,,CAT
"We have got a long time to save,",,INFO
"my husband, he's the real, he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Oh, no,",,INFO
no,,INFO
"Well, I know,",,G_G
"but there are times when I sit there and I think, wow, you know we make X amount of money and where is it.",,INFO
I mean you look around,,INFO
"and you go,",,INFO
"What do you do with it,",,INFO
I know.,,G_G
"where is it,",,INFO
"you, you haven't made, uh, big purchases",,INFO
"and that's the easier thing to see,",,INFO
"if you can see a big purchase and you go okay, well this is the year that we bought the couch or the T V,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
or something like that.,,INFO
"But, all those, just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door",,INFO
"and there's big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
and stuff.,,INFO
"That you don't have tangible, I mean the perishable kind of things that's gone, used and gone.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it's, it's amazing how much we spend on some things.",,INFO
My husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And that's all he has,",,INFO
he has a ten dollar bill.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"And, I mean, so I'd say at least, two usually three times a week he takes his lunch.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"The other times, he'll, uh, I don't know go out somewhere,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
eat in a cafeteria or whatever.,,INFO
"But, but he keeps himself on that,",,INFO
"I mean, he found it's, it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That's a hundred dollars a month on lunch.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"That's, that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch.",,INFO
.,,CAT
.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"When he can take a sandwich, you know.",,INFO

"Um, are you from this area?",,QUESTION
I'm from Dallas.,,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT

so.,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
"Well, I'm in Dallas right now,",,INFO
but I live in Garland.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, well, I don't know if you know,",,INFO
"but Garland has got a real big recycling center that, in fact, we went to it yesterday.",,INFO
You drive up,,INFO
"and you take the stuff out of your trunk,",,INFO
"and they have different bins for the different materials, like clear,",,INFO
.,,CAT
glass and colored glass and plastics,,INFO
"and, uh, they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom.",,INFO
That's pretty neat.,,INFO
"My, my daughter is four,",,INFO
and she's real interested in recycling.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So we're, we're trying to promote that, because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away,",,INFO
"but, we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them.",,INFO
"Uh, does Dallas have a curbside recycling program yet?",,QUESTION
"Um, well, I don't know Dallas,",,CAT
in Richardson does.,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"Um, they started with newspapers and, uh, of course aluminum cans, and",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and bottles and plastic.,,INFO
"I didn't know there were different types of plastic, though.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"um, like soda bottles are one kin-, one type of plastic,",,INFO
and milk jugs are one type of plastic.,,INFO
"You can te-,",,CAT
"it's got little,",,INFO
"most of the recyclable containers have the little symbol on the bottom with the, with the arrows around it",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
that tells whether it's a one or a two or a three.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"It's, it's just different kinds of plastics, like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic.",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"And that's, that's what the different types are.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
It seems to be made out of something different.,,INFO

but it's like polytechnochloride and all that fun stuff.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, I, I don't know if they do it all over,",,INFO
but our Kroger does a newspaper recycling every Saturday.,,INFO
"You can drive up,",,INFO
"and they have one of the clerks up there, no, the bag boys out there, um, that will take the papers, newspaper out of your car,",,INFO
"and they'll put it in their little bin,",,INFO
"and they do the recycling,",,INFO
"I mean, they collect the newspapers and their pla-, their plastic grocery bags",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
which I think is pretty neat.,,INFO
.,,CAT
That's something since we all seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
I know we use them for trash can liners and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
a lot of other things.,,INFO
Lunch bags.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
in fact I have one today.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
The only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
they do.,,INFO
"It's like, whoops, there goes my chips",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"okay,",,INFO
fine.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Now, I,",,CAT
in fact did you happen to see TWENTY TWENTY the other night?,,QUESTION
"Uh, no.",,CAT
"They did a program,",,INFO
"or th-, one of their articles was on recycling,",,INFO
"and, uh, it was actually on a town that has a dump that they charge other cities, or towns to come in and dump their trash there.",,INFO
"They have made so much money from that, that they built, they bought a brand new fire engine,",,INFO
"and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough, so they bo-, bought a new, or built a new one",,INFO
.,,CAT
and paid for it in cash with the money that they've earned from this landfill.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
They have built up one mountain.,,INFO
They call it Mount Trashmore,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"They built up one mountain, covered it with grass, and put ski lifts on it,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and in the winter they put snow on it,",,INFO
and they charge to ski on it.,,INFO
"So the city gets the money from that,",,INFO
"they built a golf course at the bottom,",,INFO
and they get the money from that.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"I's like,",,CAT
"that's,",,CAT
"it's a, it's, Riverview, Ohio or some place up there.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But it was, I thought it was a pretty neat idea.",,INFO
"They, I mean, their city hall looked better,",,INFO
"it was nicer than Dallas',",,INFO
and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
And they like the trash.,,INFO
So,,CAT
"Well, okay",,CAT
But I thought it was pretty neat.,,INFO
"It, it would be nice if more communities could do that,",,INFO
"but, you have to know from beginning,",,INFO
and you have to have the space to do it,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
they'll run out of space before long.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"see, that's,",,CAT
well they're already planning a second mountain.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, they're going to get, going to be called the Twin Peaks.",,INFO
"I was like, uh-huh. Go back two T V shows.",,INFO
"This, it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling",,INFO
"It,",,CAT
"I know, I've got a two year old and a four year old,",,INFO
"and that's,",,CAT
"my daughter thinks that any time she sees newspapers bundled up, they're being recycled.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, it's like, well, no, Honey.",,INFO
"So that, like,",,CAT
"so that was one reason we went to show her what people did with their, their stuff when they recycled it",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and try to explain well, yeah, you melt down the cans",,INFO
"and you make them into new things,",,INFO
and you get the paper all wet,,INFO
"and you make it into new paper,",,INFO
"and, that's fun, trying to explain that to a four year old",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Um, so do you all go ahead,",,QUESTION
"They don't even know that paper comes from trees now,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
"she,",,CAT
"that was her next question, was, how do you grow paper?",,INFO
How do you grow paper?,,CAT
"Was like, well, from trees",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
um. That's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees.,,INFO
And how do you grow aluminum?,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
Um.,,CAT
"Well, let's see, um,",,CAT
.,,CAT
"we really don't,",,INFO
"but. And then she was like, well, what do you do with the glass?",,INFO
"Well, you crunch it up real small",,INFO
and then you melt it down.,,INFO
"Well, what if it breaks?",,INFO
"Well, okay,",,INFO
"It, it, it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"But at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing,",,INFO
"and she got our baby-sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans, because that's all she talked about.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, I guess what,",,CAT
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"Uh, go ahead.",,COMMAND
What are we supposed to discuss again?,,QUESTION
"AIDS research is something that,",,INFO
"More money ,",,CAT
"that, I think th-, whether our country is putting enough money into it",,INFO
and actually I'm concerned that they're not.,,INFO
"I have a friend who is working with, uh, who works with, uh, travel groups,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and one of the ones that he's w-, worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS, uh, conference in, uh, California.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And these were from other, people from other countries.",,INFO
He's a translator.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And in talking to the people from France he said, you know,",,INFO
"he says, one of the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you enough about how it pervasive and frightening this epidemic is.",,INFO
"And they're letting,",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"the information out slowly about how, you know, how big it is.",,INFO
"Which is scary, you know, pretty scary when so many people get it.",,INFO
"So, I guess I'm, I'm, I'd like to see us spend more.",,INFO
I don't know that spending more always gets it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I'm, I'm ambivalent about it because, um, uh, i-, well it is very frightening and scary.",,INFO
"I have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases,",,INFO
"and, uh, I mean whether,",,CAT
"You mean more money for that means less for cancer or,",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"Y-, yeah.",,CAT
"And, uh, whether those diseases can yo-,",,CAT
some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
uh,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"didn't, uh, you know,",,CAT
"but I, uh,",,CAT
"then t-, part of it's lack of education.",,INFO
"I don't know whether, whether, you know, where our money would be most effectively spent.",,INFO
"Well it,",,CAT
"I, I agree with you there",,CAT
"because I know every time that i-, something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one",,INFO
and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Money from, money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly,",,INFO
or do they both get served?,,QUESTION
"Uh, that's a good point.",,INFO
"And I'm, I am concerned a lot about, uh, I'm concerned about, uh, two things.",,INFO
One is preventing the spread,,INFO
"and the other is for, uh, for, uh, treating the illness.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I'm not certain,",,INFO
"I, I,",,CAT
"again this,",,CAT
"I'm telling you,",,CAT
basically I don't have any opinion.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But whether or not it would be, uh, our money would be better spent, uh, teaching, you know, working on the drug problems and the, and the sex problems, uh, rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.",,INFO
"Well, and one of the things I'd,",,CAT
"and I'm with you that I don't know is, is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, you know,",,CAT
"That's, that's the part that,",,CAT
"t-, d-, whether my dentist or",,CAT
"That's the part that scares me, you know.",,INFO
"I mean beginning with this is, this is just for homosexuals,",,INFO
"well no,",,INFO
"it's for homosexuals and gays,",,INFO
"well no,",,INFO
"actually, it's,",,INFO
"I mean, you know.",,CAT
Did they know that all along?,,QUESTION
"An-, and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about mosquitoes.",,INFO
"And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not.",,INFO
Can't get it from mosquitoes.,,INFO
"And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions,",,INFO
yes.,,INFO
Oh,,CAT
And I don't know that's true or not.,,INFO
"I mean, I just heard it in passing,",,INFO
"but so what does that,",,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and,,QUESTION
"And how is it really transmitted,",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
et cetera.,,INFO
"Which is, I think, what they also don't know.",,INFO
"I mean that's,",,CAT
"I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway,",,INFO
"but, but that isn't how it was in Africa.",,INFO
No.,,CAT
"In Africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that,",,INFO
and it's huge over there.,,INFO
"So I, I, you know,",,CAT
"and it's beginning, t-, other countries",,CAT
that's what's his point.,,INFO
"This was an international,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this.",,INFO
"And does that mean like flus and everything else, there are all these different strains of it?",,QUESTION
Oh.,,CAT
I mean I don't know.,,INFO
All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know.,,INFO
"Uh, or maybe they understand but,",,INFO
I think maybe more information should be given out about it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and, uh, and then the people that have it,",,INFO
"it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back.",,INFO
"If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care.",,INFO

right.,,CAT
I'll take anything,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
you know.,,INFO

you can experiment on me.,,INFO

Yeah.,,CAT
do it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And that's what I think they're saying too.,,INFO
,,
"Uh, I guess my feelings are that, uh, we almost have a universal health care system, uh, to a great degree, except that now I read where we've left out about thirty-four million people.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And, uh, I don't know exactly how we're going to cover many of these people, because I'm sure that some of them don't, uh, don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves,",,INFO
"so, uh, I, I have a feeling, since I have just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get, that this, uh, then becomes an obligation of the government,",,INFO
"because it's going to become an obligation of either state, local or federal government, anyway.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"because when people can't pay, they end up going to clinics or, you know, to public hospitals, and that kind of thing,",,INFO
"and, you know,",,CAT
"Well, it seems to me that, that I'm paying anyway, because when I go, or my insurance carrier, anyway, when I pay something, the bills seem inordinately high.",,INFO
"Oh, definitely.",,CAT
"And the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has,",,INFO
.,,CAT
to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"It would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who, uh, employ these people, and pay them, uh, you know, subminimum wages or whatever,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"were asked to sh-, share their fair burden of this too, just as my employer is.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"And myself, I guess.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that sounds like a good idea.,,INFO
"My only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government,",,INFO
I don't know,,CAT
Well,,QUESTION
"Do they wind up with more red tape, and more problems then?",,QUESTION
"well, who, who else is going to do this, then?",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, it's worked successfully in Europe.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I've heard all these stories about,",,INFO
"I travel extensively and spend, uh, maybe half a year in Europe every year,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"and I find that the health care programs there, uh, are administered with, uh, at least people I talk to, with, uh, a great deal of integrity,",,INFO
"and, uh, people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"As a matter of fact, if I'm injured or have an emergency when I'm, say in Germany or France, uh, that, I'm automatically taken care of,",,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
I mean I don't even have to pay.,,INFO
"A-,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I think part of the, the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money, until, you know, they have no preventative measures",,INFO
"People, um, you know, just go on and on and on.",,INFO
"I mean, so many people don't even get prenatal care",,INFO

"well, my father's not living but my mother is,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they are, um, of an advanced years,",,INFO
"and when I see the money that's poured down the, down the drain on Medicare and Medicaid,",,INFO
"I mean, the,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in,",,INFO
"and the extraordinary amounts,",,INFO
"I know that,",,INFO
"because those people vote,",,INFO
"I mean, they're the ones who get out and vote,",,INFO
"that's what's robbing a poor mother of the p-, prenatal care.",,INFO
"The young people aren't getting the proper care that they need, and nutrition, I think,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"and we're spending on these useless, many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people.",,INFO
"Oh, it's unbelievable how much you go through.",,G_G
"When I just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar CAT scan, and, I mean, a chiropractor got it in one time",,INFO
"That's right,",,G_G
"I mean, it does,",,INFO
it was just strange.,,INFO
"seem like we're, th-, th-, th-,",,INFO
"now I noticed just the other day in the paper that, that Medicare will be based, payments will be based not, uh, just on cost, but on cost effectiveness.",,INFO
"So I gue-,",,CAT
"Oh, well, that should help.",,INFO
"Well, I don't know, uh,",,CAT
we'll see how that goes.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
"I think that was just a regulation that was up for comment,",,INFO

Oh I see,,G_G
"Oh, gosh.",,G_G

thank you.,,G_G

,,
How would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home?,,QUESTION
"Well, I don't feel very good about it,",,INFO
but I think that at some times it can be the right thing to do.,,INFO
We sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"He actually died a few months after that,",,INFO
"and so as,",,CAT
"at least in retrospect, it was the right thing to do",,INFO
because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days.,,INFO
And what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him?,,QUESTION
"Um, well, the, see, uh, well,",,CAT
"we, he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list",,INFO
"Oh, my.",,G_G
"right,",,CAT
"we wound up just choosing a, another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into.",,INFO
"Or but naturally,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
"it was even Mennonite related,",,INFO
"I'm sorry, it was actually not a particularly great nursing home.",,INFO
"Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
because he suddenly got sick,,INFO
"so the convenience,",,INFO
and needed to be put in.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, what do you think?",,QUESTION
"My grandmother lived with us, um, until August, um,",,INFO
and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home.,,INFO
She has leukemia,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and her, the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton, and were several thousand miles away",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"so I made the decision to put her in a nursing home,",,INFO
and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility.,,INFO
She had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and T V set,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
so.,,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
that's important,,G_G
Yes.,,CAT
I would say.,,INFO
"And that, the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days, and would have to be hospitalized a day or two,",,INFO
so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
so she didn't have to be transported back and forth.,,INFO
"So, she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well.",,INFO
It's not her favorite place to be in.,,INFO
She'd much rather be here with me.,,INFO
But,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"when it got to the point I was spending more time at the hospital with her,",,INFO
and I've got little children here who needed me here,,INFO
"Right, so that, *",,CAT
she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
and,,INFO
So.,,CAT
that becomes difficult then.,,INFO
She was falling down and hemorrhaging,,INFO
"and, you know, all kinds of physical problems,",,INFO
"so it just became too much for me to handle,",,INFO
"even though I would have liked to have had her stay, with her health being what it was she couldn't",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
anymore.,,INFO
"Yep,",,CAT
"we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life,",,INFO
but he was essentially too proud and too independent,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
he lived in his own house as long as he could,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"but he was living alone, had an upstairs apartment, could barely make it up the steps",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"to the top without a great deal of pain,",,INFO
"and this,",,CAT
eventually things just went too far,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"well, I think sometimes when people get to be a certain age, other people have to kind of help them make decisions.",,INFO
"It sure wouldn't have been Granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home,",,INFO
but she's accepted it real well now,,INFO
Right,,CAT
so.,,CAT
"well that's, yeah, that's right that the children have some responsibility, too, to their parents and such, to help decide what's the right thing.",,INFO
"Well, we enjoyed",,INFO
And.,,CAT
"having her here,",,INFO
but we feel she's much safer where she is now.,,INFO
"She still continues to fall,",,INFO
"but when she does there, a nurse is right there to help her",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I know she's eating the right things,",,INFO
"and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her,",,INFO
so. It became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair,,INFO
Yep.,,CAT
"so, I think she'll adjust,",,INFO
,,
"Wendy, I guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if, uh, if that may be the case",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that, uh,",,INFO
"let me ask you the question,",,INFO
"do you have a, uh, budget, or a monthly budget, or a long term budget that you stick to?",,QUESTION
Right now I'm in college,,INFO
and I'm on work study,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and so my budget comes from my dad's help.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
He helps me out a lot,,INFO
"and I get paid monthly,",,INFO
so that's kind of hard to have a budget.,,INFO
"My mother, uh, doesn't get paid much money,",,INFO
"so her budget is, uh, just, uh, planning for I R A's.",,INFO
"I see,",,CAT
I see.,,CAT
"Well, good,",,G_G
"I'm kind of in a different situation,",,INFO
"but I, I, I went through that, too, when I was in school,",,INFO
"but, uh, I was, I was working to get through college and, and, uh, trying to make it through that,",,INFO
"but, uh,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"I'm married and have, uh, a, a couple of children",,INFO
and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"we have to, uh, pretty much stick to a budget.",,INFO
I'm on a salary,,INFO
so I don't get any overtime or anything like that,,INFO
"but,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
We have a fixed income,,INFO
"and we have to make sure that, uh, every dollar we have will, is spent accordingly",,INFO
"and, uh, what we try and do to, to stick to our monthly budget is",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"we pretty much have, you know, the house payment,",,INFO
"we have the insurance premiums, uh, utilities and so forth",,INFO
"and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside,",,INFO
"and we also try and set aside money for savings, set aside money for the coll-, the kids' education",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"college education, the future and, uh, set aside money for bonds",,INFO
"and, and we also set aside an emergency fund",,INFO
because,,INFO
That sounds good.,,G_G
"we've, uh, we've been married for about ten years",,INFO
"and we find out that, you know, no matter what kind of budget you stick on, there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"happen with the house, that you have to have money for and, uh, not enough to go and to take a loan out, but, uh, you have to have money for.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, uh, then we have, you know,",,INFO
"whatever's left over is disposable in-, disposable, dis-, yeah, discretionary income,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"that we use for the rest of the month,",,INFO
"so, and it's worked out very well.",,INFO
"It's, uh, it's helped us, so that we haven't been, you know, too long on the month and too short on the money and",,INFO
"Well, that's good.",,G_G
"uh, try and stick with that",,INFO
"and, nice thing about it, I, my wife is, is excellent in that we both work together,",,INFO
"we both have a budget,",,INFO
and we stick to it,,INFO
"Well, good.",,G_G
and there's no surprises in that,,INFO
"With two kids, that could be hard.",,INFO
"Well, actually I have four kids.",,INFO
Four!,,G_G
"So,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"I said a couple of kids,",,INFO
"I, I guess I should have specified,",,INFO
I have four,,INFO

yeah.,,CAT
Four boys.,,CAT
You bet.,,G_G

Uh-huh.,,CAT
uh.,,INFO
Well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city?,,QUESTION
"Well, I think it's, what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols, trying to put, put more guys, more cops, higher visibility,",,INFO
"and, uh,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,",,INFO

I probably agree with that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Uh.,,CAT
"You know, particularly in some of the housing projects, uh, you know, that's, that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they've got to do more than just having, having cops there.",,INFO
They've got to kind of change the way people think about it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's probably true.,,INFO
"Um, so, um, well do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities?",,QUESTION
"Um, well, I've been to,",,CAT

"Um, it's nowhere near as bad as New York City",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
for example.,,INFO

It's that obvious.,,INFO

"I don't know,",,CAT
"I came to the conclusion also that, you know, just, if you are walking in a downtown area, you know, where there's a lot of crime, a lot of that's going to just, just keeping your senses about you and, and trying not to look like a victim, you know.",,INFO

I was much younger at the time,,INFO

I've been pretty lucky about getting mugged.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,INFO

And that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed.,,INFO

so maybe that counts.,,INFO
"Oh, really.",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, where was, where, where was that?",,QUESTION
Was that downtown,,QUESTION
"or,",,QUESTION
"Oh no,",,CAT
"that was in the northern p-, um, up near Cumberland Mall area.",,INFO
Really.,,G_G
"It's actually Cobb County,",,INFO
but it is Atlanta,,INFO
"Metropolitan,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"and, uh, there's a lot of car thefts in that area.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I've actually, I've known, known some people that have had their cars stolen.",,INFO
"Uh, and, uh, and, you know, about half the time they seem to, the A P D seems to recover them, you know",,INFO

in various states of disrepair,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
Up on blocks.,,INFO
"My friend had a V W Rabbit,",,INFO

"Yeah,",,CAT
"mine was just, it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage,",,INFO
"but they didn't, they didn't strip it",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
so I got it back.,,INFO
"Well, you're probably luckier than.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
than most.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, so like does insurance pay for the body damage,",,QUESTION
or,,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
"was that all there was, body.",,INFO
It was about three grand to put everything together.,,INFO
"They cracked the steering column of course, to steal the car.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you got to, you crack the steering column",,INFO
"and you pull the,",,INFO
there's a pin in there that you can pull on these G M cars,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and you can start it up, basically pretty easily.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So how do you know this much about, um, stealing cars?",,QUESTION
"Well, after I found mine I had to, I had this,",,INFO
.,,CAT
,,
"Well, Hal, what's, uh, what's crime like in Dallas?",,QUESTION
"Well, it depends where in Dallas you are.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
There are certainly parts of town I would not want to live in.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Because it's the situation,,INFO
it is very location dependent,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and there are parts of town here where, when they talk about the nightly gunfire.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
in Baltimore we have similar.,,INFO
"Uh, I live on the outskirts of Baltimore",,INFO
"and, uh, we live right outside the city",,INFO
"and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people, though I'm in graduate school, uh,",,INFO
I live here because it's close to the university.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, you know, we have, uh,",,CAT
"it, it's really funny,",,INFO
"the only crime we really see is, uh, just the kids being malicious.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, and I think most of that is because their parents aren't around.",,INFO
That make sense?,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"That, uh, the, what they call the latchkey children.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
something like that.,,CAT
"No one's, you know,",,CAT
"or, or fathers are just missing, you know,",,INFO
"so there's no, uh, no consistency there in the home or whatever.",,INFO
"There's no one to tell them what's right and what's wrong, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
The sort of on my end is more of the upper middle class,,INFO
so,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I think our, uh,",,INFO
not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"but on the other hand, uh, we get the, uh, affect of the, uh, the city",,INFO
"and, uh, the main crimes within the suburb here are the, the theft crimes.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"A small number of assaults,",,INFO
"uh, well, if we have one murder a year",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"that's probably as many,",,INFO
"but then, you know, you go into Dallas and they are, unfortunately",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, having murders",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
at a rate greater than one a day.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think that's, we're about the same in Baltimore.",,INFO
"Though, uh, Washington, I think is, uh, close by",,INFO
"and, you know, they experience a lot more.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I think they definitely have more problems that, uh, in, in the area.",,INFO
"What, what do you think can prevent crime?",,QUESTION
"Well, the thing is, I don't,",,CAT
"it's one of those things where, if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like, uh, wherever there are more, uh, criminals, there are more policemen",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
but that's which came first.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"But, on the other side of it is",,CAT
"it's, it's basically the, the problem is within the, in the society",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and the society's views,,INFO
"and, well, uh, since now I'm in my mid-forties, when I was in grad school or when I was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I thought, you know, crime was, was reasonably unknown",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and just the situation that's developed with the, the drug *",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think, *",,CAT
"aspect of, uh",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,INFO
"uh, the pushers, the dealers and the addicts, uh,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I, I think, I agree with you there.",,CAT
"Because it just was not, uh, something back in the sixties that",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, I even had to worry about.",,INFO
"But I think, you know, that there is a lot in the society where things have changed,",,INFO
"uh, so it's effected all of us.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think they, the drug culture definitely has, uh, is one of the main problems.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"our, uh, our mayor in, uh, Baltimore is one of the people that goes on national television and says they should, uh, legalize drugs. *",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Because it would eliminate the, uh, the violence and the, uh, the under-, the, the market, I guess, the, the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it. *",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That make sense?,,CAT
He's one of the big proponents of that.,,INFO
"He gets on national television and, and says that, you know.",,INFO
"So it's, uh",,CAT
"and he was a d-, d-, a District Attorney before, and a prosecutor before becoming, becoming mayor.",,INFO
"So that's a really stran-,",,INFO
"you know, it's a different viewpoint.",,INFO
"I, uh,",,CAT
"You know, in a sense I don't, I'm n-, I have real mixed feelings on that",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"because it comes a bit from the angle that the, uh, uh,",,CAT
it would certainly be an interesting test,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but the other side of it, to me,",,CAT
What happens if we lose worse.,,QUESTION
"Uh, y-,",,CAT
"well, the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side,",,CAT
"and I think if I look back fifty or a hundred years I'd say, you know, back then there were the opium dens",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"but the thing is, if somebody ruined their life, uh, society didn't try to then save themselves from it,",,INFO
they let this person who had ruined it,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, become, well, die or whatever.",,INFO
I mean,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short,",,INFO
"but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise,",,INFO
"we need to take care of people even if they have, you know, physically ruined themselves.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
they have induced it themselves.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"and so, to me that's,",,CAT
"I, uh, I would certainly like to see a real test of, of making drugs real cheap",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
to see if when you make them available people then don't use them.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Well I think,,INFO
"Uh, *",,CAT
"you know, they did that in Alaska. That, that actually, Alaska just recently legalized marijuana. *",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,INFO
"But I never, I never heard results or anything like that,",,INFO
"so I never, you know,",,CAT
"plus, that's such a, that's not a true, uh, you know, it really couldn't be a good test because Alaska's so different than every other part of the country.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, so that, but that was interesting, you know,",,INFO
"I, I don't,",,CAT
"crime is one of those things that's, uh,",,CAT
"I, I don't know, you know,",,CAT
"the drug culture,",,CAT
"the, uh, the, uh, you know,",,CAT
"I, I see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things, not thinking anything wrong with it.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, th-, some of that,",,CAT
"and, of course, I'm a baby of the old school",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"but, it, it bothers me from the fifties on,",,INFO
not that I'd remember that much,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
from the fifties,,INFO
"but, but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
That's true.,,CAT
We worked hard for everything.,,INFO
That's very true.,,CAT
And so they,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"in the,",,CAT
"there were the sixty-four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties,",,INFO
"but nowadays, there's so much on TV where, where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing.",,INFO
Of course,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, I work for lawyers a lot",,INFO
"and I see, unfortunately, we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and, you know, there's a million dollars you can have",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, for mental duress or whatever.",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"But, you know, the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the, uh,",,INFO
"in Europe, they seem to have mentality,",,CAT
"and drunk driving is a good one,",,CAT
is that people are well indoctrinated in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, yeah,",,CAT
"if you're going to drink, and you may drink, you better have your designated driver.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"In this country, and for example with alcohol or with drugs is, we don't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay, it is okay under these circumstances, but if you step outside these bounds, the punishment is extreme. *",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And we mean it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"That, I think that, uh, the drunk driving has just actually, just caught on.",,INFO
"Uh,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"A-, and I, I, I really, uh,",,INFO
my father was hit by a drunk driver when I was in high school,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, that was a very, uh, that, that was an awful three years afterwards. You know, of recovery",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and the difficulties and, uh, everything we did",,INFO
"and, you know, the guy went free because this was twelve years ago",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"thirteen years ago,",,INFO
"there was no,",,CAT
"his father was even, the, uh, police chief of the town.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So there was no repercussion at all. You know, other than insurance,",,INFO
but he was uninsured.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, uh, our insurance paid for everything,",,INFO
but it was a very difficult time,,INFO
"and, and then later, this was actually funny, my brother and I were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a, a new car",,INFO
and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and broke all his windows and his lights and his, dented it everywhere,",,INFO
and they came and questioned us.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, and,",,CAT
"But, that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and driving was, uh, misplaced",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
for years,,INFO
Yep. *,,CAT
"that, you know, it was an acceptable social behavior.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
very much so.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that, those are some important points.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I,",,CAT
"that's, those are,",,CAT
"What are, what does your city have for gun control if anything?",,QUESTION
"Well, see Maryland is one of the most,",,CAT

,,
All set.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Actually I'm in Plano, too",,INFO
That's okay.,,CAT
I say Dallas area when I'm talking to people elsewhere.,,INFO
"That's okay,",,CAT
"it's more, uh, concentrated, so they know where you are.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, anyway, I know here in, here in Plano some of the things that we do are, um, Kroger",,INFO
"and some of the other stores, too, have said, If you bring your bags back to, to the store to recycle, then they'll pay you a certain amount of money,",,INFO
and that's one thing that started in the community.,,INFO
They actually pay you money for that?,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, um, Brookshires up in uh, Allen, uh, you bring your bags back, you know, they, uh, the plastic bags back or the paper bags, you put them in the receptacles there,",,INFO
but I didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that. Um.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"I know Kroger will do it,",,INFO
"and I think Albertson's does it sometimes,",,INFO
I'm not sure.,,INFO
"Um, and, and yet, I know that, uh, some of the stores will actually help the community, not pay you the money back, but will pay the, the, uh, community, like through the schools",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
or things like that.,,INFO
Interesting.,,INFO
"So, um, that's always helpful,",,INFO
"and I know that we ha-, we have the, the can, the can, different can banks around the city",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
that you can go to and do that.,,INFO
"Um, one of the ways,",,CAT
"I don't know, uh, if this would be helpful.",,CAT
"It said on the, the computer, what do I think would be helpful.",,INFO
"And I don't know if it would be helpful or not,",,CAT
"but I know on Monday, the, the garbage men pick up like just, um, any limbs or any extra trash that you might have,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And that might be an extra day to put out things that might be recycled if we had a, a certain colored can to put them in or something in the city to put, like either glass or newspapers or whatever.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think they already do that out East.,,INFO
"Um, they have to, it's a little bit more difficult, because people have to remember, Okay, today's glass",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"okay tomorrow's plastic, and all that",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
but I think that's the way we need to go.,,INFO
"It's, uh, it's pretty bad.",,INFO
All these years we've,,CAT
"been, especially in this country, all the, uh, the plastic and the paper and everything, we just used to throw out.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"uh, I know getting a newspaper everyday, I know I could just, you know, do that",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"because I have to pick it up,",,INFO
"and it just goes out with our trash,",,INFO
"and I guess I'm not as, um, recycling minded as I should be",,INFO
.,,CAT
"but that goes out with the trash,",,INFO
and it really could be recycled.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
about six months ago I started,,INFO
Did you?,,QUESTION
"yeah,",,CAT
"and, uh",,INFO
Tell me.,,COMMAND
"so what I do is, uh,",,INFO
"it's not bad,",,INFO
"you just have to have a place to keep everything,",,INFO
"but, uh, it, you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it.",,INFO
"Just put your paper in the same place every day,",,COMMAND
and it'll start stacking up.,,INFO
"Take your glass, um, you know, pickle jars, or, or whatever, uh, liquid jars, you know,",,COMMAND
just rinse them out a little bit,,COMMAND

I just tear them off,,INFO

"And I said, What do you mean the ones that don't belong there?",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And they said, Well, people come in and put anything in the receptacles.",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"the plastic ones, they've got numbers on them.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT

Huh.,,CAT
"and pour the wine sauce over it as, like the last twenty minutes,",,INFO

"Oh, that sounds",,G_G
"And, you can add hamburger if you want,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
to give it a little more body.,,INFO
That sounds good.,,G_G
"So, I, I try to always keep my eyes open and because a lot of time you can find, find really good recipes where you wouldn't even think about it.",,INFO

How do you feel about gun control?,,QUESTION
"Well, uh, I mean I don't think that guns should be outlawed",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"but it's going to,",,CAT
"a lot of the stuff that,",,CAT
I mean all you do is to get guns,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen, Texas not too long ago,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But I don't really know, I mean, unless they do, uh, just outlaw them, how you can, uh, prevent that.",,INFO
"Well, don't you think that you know, just having, you know, some, you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with, with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry.",,QUESTION
"I mean,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that,",,CAT
well do you even know what the procedures are now?,,QUESTION
It varies from State to State.,,CAT
Um.,,CAT
"There is no national,",,INFO
"But, it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun, especially if you have the money to pay for it.",,INFO
"Uh, in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know or on probation or, uh, you know, other obvious things like that.",,INFO
"Uh, and I know, I know that like in a lot of states you could, you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before. You know, be, be obviously insane,",,INFO
"and then, you, you know but have your legal right to get a gun.",,INFO
Huh. I didn't know that.,,INFO
"Well, that's pretty scary.",,G_G
"So, does, now do they want us to say where we feel about it, like in rating it one to ten.",,QUESTION
"Uh, yeah,",,CAT
"I'd probably, I'd probably say about a five.",,INFO
That's where I would probably be,,INFO
"Seems like it's a good safe number to pick, you know.",,INFO
"Well, I mean, I mean I don't really know what they can, how they can really enforce the laws any better",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"because I mean I do think that some people need them and, like, for protection and stuff",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I can understand them wanting to have them,",,INFO
but then again it's just like all those nuts out there.,,INFO
"Well, you know, uh, uh, no-,",,CAT
"if you are looking at like you know country that, uh, where they do have a lot more gun control, like England and places like that, you know",,INFO
the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much.,,INFO
It has?,,QUESTION
"Because then,",,CAT
Well I mean yeah.,,CAT
"The, uh, the",,CAT
in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"Uh, you know, I mean, the problem though, you know, they, if the, since the United States had this, you know, pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think, you know, if you were introduced, you know, any controls, it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, so it's, it's really kind of a complex problem.",,INFO
"Well, is the crime that bad there in Atlanta?",,QUESTION
"Uh, I'm not really sure how bad it is.",,CAT
"I've, I've not really had that many problems with it,",,INFO
"but I mean apparently we, we were ranked pretty high up.",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
I know Dallas is.,,INFO
"Uh. I mean, I think, you know, in the te-,",,CAT
I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years.,,INFO
I don't know if Dallas is in the top three,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but. Do you own a gun?,,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
I've thought about getting one.,,INFO
"If I get one, I think I will probably, you know, get something.",,INFO
I probably wouldn't get a hand gun.,,INFO
I would probably get like a shotgun.,,INFO
"Just for protecting myself. You know, from",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
burglar type thing.,,INFO
I do kind of live in the downtown area.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know and shotguns are really good because they're,",,INFO
"I mean somebody is not going to break in, steal it, and you know, use it to mug someone, you know.",,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
"Uh, and you know, you,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"I just don't understand these people, you know, like when they, they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves.",,INFO
"They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know,",,INFO
they are probably going to miss the person,,INFO
"and, and they're going to shoot through five wall,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and hit someone, you know.",,INFO
I mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon.,,INFO
You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
you know whoever.,,INFO
"Well,",,INFO
You pretty much stop them.,,INFO
"And, you don't,",,CAT
"then the actual shot doesn't go that far, you know, a wall will stop it pretty much.",,INFO
"Well, now when I first moved to Dallas, I moved up here by myself",,CAT
"and, uh, my Dad gave me a gun",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
so I finally ended up giving it back to him.,,INFO
I said I don't want it.,,INFO
I don't want to be responsible for it because,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and if I am not going to, you know,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"be responsible enough to go out and learn, I don't need it.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that, that really does scare me. People, you know, that have guns",,INFO
"because you know, if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot,",,INFO
but you pick up the gun and point it at the person,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"that, that person rushes you.",,INFO
And they get it from you.,,INFO
"And you know, you're pretty much dead you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Because you, you've just told the person that you, you're about to kill them then,",,INFO
Set them off.,,INFO
You know,,INFO
"and, and, well I mean, you, you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he, unless, you know that you are a real danger to them",,INFO
"and then you know if you, if they manage to get the gun from you, you know their first reaction is going to be you know, stop you.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
well that's why I ended up giving it back to him.,,INFO
I thought well,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know. I don't want it if I don't know how to oper-, you know, if I don't really know how to use it",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I just didn't want the responsibility.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"So. Well, uh, did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever?",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"the, did it happen at a cafeteria or something?",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
That kind of,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns.,,INFO
I would be scared selling guns to people.,,INFO
,,
I'm ready if you are.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"Um, wh-, where do you stand, uh, on,",,QUESTION
"Well, I think that people should be allowed to have them.",,INFO
Especially,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"if they go hunting,",,INFO
which my son goes hunting.,,INFO
He goes deer hunting.,,INFO
He goes duck hunting.,,INFO
"Uh, he's read books about guns since he was",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
like probably eleven or twelve years old.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT

As far as,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT

"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
I agree too.,,INFO
"I, uh,",,CAT
"it's, it's, as far as the ban goes and everything, I don't think it's possible, uh, to completely ban guns.",,INFO
There's just too many.,,INFO
"Well, no.",,CAT
"There's too many sports people out there that, that do do these things.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"and I,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"right,",,CAT
"I mean,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"that, that's true.",,INFO
"And I mean the, the technology's not that hard.",,INFO
"I mean, you could make a gun, you know, from simple, you know, you know.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well I suppose you could. Uh,",,CAT
"You know, if, if you really wanted a gun, you, you could make one. Uh,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I think if they want one, they're going to get one.",,INFO
"Oh, you know",,CAT
You know.,,CAT
true.,,CAT
That's true.,,CAT
"The bad guys are, you know,",,INFO

"it's,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"I mean,",,CAT
yeah,,CAT
"there's, there's no way to stop, uh, stop anybody from getting a gun.",,INFO
"Uh, I think there should be more control as, like, uh, like maybe waiting periods and things like that, you know, uh,",,INFO
"Well I agree with you on that because I know, uh,",,CAT
in fact I had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And for a rifle there's no waiting.,,INFO
There wasn't anyhow.,,CAT
Now there might be now.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
But,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"there wasn't anything for, you know, rifles and things like that.",,INFO

I mean,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, you know, anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and there's, I mean, there's nothing.",,INFO
You can just go buy one and take it home,,INFO
"and it's easier than getting a, like a video membership card at, you know, a video store.",,INFO
"I, see now, I know they were having a gun show about a month ago",,INFO
"and I was just wondering how that did work, if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show.",,INFO
"Uh, yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"You just go and, uh, buy the gun",,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
There's no restriction though.,,INFO
You don't have to wait or nothing then huh?,,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
"Well, except for the, the pistols and th-,",,INFO
I'm not sure how they do that.,,INFO
"I know they,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I was just curious, you know, because, uh",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I know at, at the regular gun show, you know, gun shop",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that you,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"that you do have to wait for pistols, like a couple",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
of weeks,,INFO
"and then they check you out,",,INFO
then they call you up,,INFO
"and you h-, go pick it up.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think that's,",,INFO
Which I think they have to do on rifles and things now too.,,INFO
I think there,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
.,,CAT
"is some, something like that.",,INFO
"Anyhow, here, out here in California, I think there is now.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
"But,",,CAT
"I'm not sure,",,INFO
"I'm not really sure but, what uh, th-, the gun laws in P-, Pennsylvania are like.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Now we don't have guns because,,INFO
No.,,CAT
we don't go hunting or anything like that.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But like I say, my son, he's,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"he's always had a,",,INFO
"like, I think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But he's always, he went to the, to the school to learn how to shoot it.",,INFO
He goes to the pistol range,,INFO
"and th-, and the rifle range to shoot them.",,INFO
"He likes to go to that, uh, shotgun thing where you shoot at those, uh",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"The skeets, you mean?",,QUESTION
"yeah,",,CAT
right,,CAT
He likes to do that,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
you know,,INFO
"But, uh",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
I don't know.,,INFO
"I think they should try to control it and everything, you know.",,INFO
"But as far as just banning it completely, there, that's not going to happen.",,INFO
"I don't, yeah, I, I don't think it can happen either.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I just don't, I don't see,",,INFO
"and, then, I, I think, uh, hadn't thought about this before",,INFO
"but if you do that, if they would, uh, uh, decide to ban guns, it would just open up a, a market, you know, a black market for them.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"And so, you know, they, they would just,",,INFO
"all the profits would go to, you know,",,INFO
"Now I do believe though, like in California, if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think they're liable now for,",,INFO
they,,INFO
"Oh, th-,",,CAT
"can be, you know, put in jail and everything. The, whoever owned the gun.",,INFO
"Oh , yeah,",,INFO
the owner's responsibility?,,INFO

and so they do all the lawn,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
all the lawn care,,INFO

Yeah.,,CAT
"So, they're all gone at this point.",,INFO
"Gardening in Texas is really interesting, though.",,INFO
I grew up in Illinois,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and, um, Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry,",,INFO
"why, you know, everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has land-, uh, watering system.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And so with that, why, our lawns do stay, um, you know, pretty nice all summer, if you water.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But in the winter, we have Bermuda grass",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
and and I just think it's ugly,,INFO
.,,CAT
"When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter, you know, and their grass is fairly green.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's one, one aspect of a lot of those grasses, they go dormant.",,INFO

uh-huh.,,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
those two.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Some people have, I think it's fescue",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"that stays green all winter,",,INFO
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
They have to water an incredible amount.,,INFO
"But, um, those law-, those lawns look nice during the winter,",,INFO
"but, you know, they almost stick out like a, I guess not a sore thumb, a pretty thumb.",,INFO
"But, you know, when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except the one, you know,",,INFO
"it's sort of like, well,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I know my folks live, uh, in Arizona there,",,INFO

that's true.,,CAT

"uh-huh,",,CAT
I think people do.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I don't have a vegetable garden,",,INFO

an interesting topic.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"The, uh, type of cars that I was, uh, I would be most interested in if I was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a, uh, Mazda Miata.",,INFO

restoring my old cars.,,INFO
I have a old Triumph T R Six.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT

I wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time,,INFO
"Oh, really.",,QUESTION
Yeah,,CAT

how old is your car?,,QUESTION

Oh.,,CAT
"Uh, which is, you know, it's,",,INFO
it still works fine,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"But it's, it's actually, it's kind of annoying cause I've got no reason to replace it",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"But, uh,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
So what do the Miatas run?,,QUESTION
"Oh, those are,",,INFO
"they're about, uh, uh, thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and, you know, a bit more if you add some some options and so on",,INFO
but,,CAT
"Well, that's not too bad.",,INFO
"the,",,INFO
"uh, yeah,",,CAT
that's a pretty good price,,INFO
and,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"they're, they're, they're, they're so nice to drive.",,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
I've never driven one.,,INFO
"Uh, uh, it's, it's, it's nice.",,INFO
"They're,",,CAT
I've been down to a dealer and driven them.,,INFO
"And I've also driven one at a, something Mazda put on where, uh, they went to, uh, autocross events across the country. Uh, which is where you race in, uh, you race on, in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of, uh, cones to see who can get through the fastest.",,INFO
Huh?,,CAT
"Uh, you know, about a minute or so.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT

And so you've done this?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT

Nice car.,,INFO
What are you interested in?,,QUESTION
Whatever my husband buys,,INFO

No.,,CAT
"We, uh, we just got rid of a full conversion van that, that I, I, i-, that wasn't me.",,INFO
That was my husband.,,INFO

He wanted a van,,INFO

.,,CAT
But I never drove it,,INFO
"so it just, it wasn't me, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I can understand.,,G_G
Well would *,,CAT
"And then,",,INFO
"you want, if you had to decide, what would you want?",,CAT
"Oh, I'd want a minivan",,INFO
"Okay, *",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
They're nice.,,INFO
Because I'm with the kids all the time.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
That's,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
perfect for that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And,",,CAT
"It's not,",,CAT
"it, it's small enough that it's easy to drive.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You pick up,,INFO
Holds a lot.,,INFO
I pick up my little one from preschool,,INFO
and the whole parking lot's full of minivans.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, you know, I, I drive a little Subaru.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, we, I love that.",,INFO
"I,",,CAT
we were going to trade that in for the van,,INFO
but I just wanted to hold on to it cause I just really enjoy that.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, uh, that's really all I needed was for something just to go here and there and back.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Minivans are nice.,,INFO
I have a friend who has a minivan.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, I've driven it a few times",,INFO
"and, uh, i-, it's nice,",,INFO
it's nice.,,INFO
"Of course, you know, my fam-, my family has always had cars like that. Uh, in that, you know, my father's had a, had a, always had a V W bus every since, uh",,INFO
"Oh, really",,CAT
"nine, about nineteen sixty or so.",,INFO
"Oh, really.",,CAT
"Uh, uh,",,CAT
.,,CAT
"they, well,",,CAT
"he, he used it,",,INFO
"he often has to transport plants or, uh, things",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"like that cause he's, he goes to orchid shows and, and, you know, fills the car with plants. And so on",,INFO
or .,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
It's amazing what a minivan can do.,,INFO
We went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And pulled the, uh, the little trailer behind.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
The pop-up trailer?,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, it's,",,CAT
"so it's really amazing how much a minivan c-, you know, what it can do.",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
And they're not that expensive.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
they're not.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
They're probably .,,CAT
"Mainly because everyone makes them, you know",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And we, we do a lot of, uh, driving.",,INFO
We do a lot of traveling.,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
.,,CAT
By car.,,INFO
"And so that's the only time that the, that the, uh, conversion van came in handy.",,INFO
"But it really didn't cause our, our kids are still little.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, uh, that was the only time we really needed it.",,INFO
"Other than that, it got terrible mileage",,INFO
and.,,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Minivans d-, do pretty well.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, twenty, twenty, twenty-five miles per gallon or more.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Some of them probably even do thirty.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"The, uh,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"There, there's some other cars I'd like",,INFO
"but I, u-, u-, I would never be willing to send quite that much money for, uh, like, uh, uh,",,INFO
I'll drool over them.,,INFO
.,,CAT
,,
Your turn.,,COMMAND
Okay.,,CAT
"Uh, I don't think they should abolish it",,INFO
"I think, I think if they put it into force more often, they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got.",,INFO
But not for petty theft?,,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
no.,,CAT
"For major things like premeditated murder. Mass murders. Uh, you know, that type of thing.",,INFO
I don't think it should just be used loosely.,,INFO
"Well, it should be used as a deterrent do you think?",,QUESTION
"Well,",,CAT
"Or should it be used, uh,",,QUESTION
"a-, to prevent further, uh, crime?",,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
To prevent these people from ever getting out on the street.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"By, you know, some technicality.",,INFO
And they go down the line ten years,,INFO
and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, you know, that's about the only thing.",,INFO
"Like for petty, for theft and, and stuff like that or manslaughter, you know,",,INFO
I don't think they should do that.,,INFO
"Well, you know, there's this old, uh, Jewish, is it, saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.",,INFO
"Oh, well, I guess,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"if I, if it was someone in my family, I'd probably feel that way.",,INFO
"You know, I've never had anybody in my immediate family, uh, murdered",,INFO
and so I really wouldn't know.,,INFO
"But, but I feel like if I did, I probably would feel that way.",,INFO
"Well, one of the things I was thinking about is, uh, you know, from society's point of view, if you put a value on each person, what you want to do is to maximize the end game value.",,INFO
"So if you have someone that, that destroys that value",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, then what you want to take steps to, uh, minimize the loss.",,INFO
"Of course, you have to also put value on the criminal.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So if you terminate him, that's a loss of value.",,INFO
"Well, that's true",,G_G
"So, you know, if you weight everyone equally, then you have to say, well the likelihood of not terminating him,",,INFO
"if you don't terminate him, the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person.",,INFO
"In other words, you'd have to, you'd have to murder more than one other person",,INFO
Besides him.,,INFO
"uh, in order to justify taking his life.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"Another way you could do it is weight this value by, uh, the value to society of the people. Uh, which is pretty delicate thing to do.",,INFO
"But one way of doing it is, uh, by income.",,INFO
"So if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"which is often times the case, then",,INFO
His life isn't worth very much then,,INFO
then he's obviously not worth very much,,INFO
"and so, uh, the likelihood that, you know, maybe expected, expected murders by him is, is, uh, integrated over the income of the people, uh, that he murders is maybe, you know, a loss of, who knows, eight hundred thousand dollars.",,INFO
"Uh, but if he only, uh, integrated, you know, integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is, uh, small, less than eight hundred thousand dollars, then you terminate him",,INFO
"Of course, one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm, is you find that it's more easy, it's easier to, uh, to, uh, terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Which means, well",,INFO
"I suppose you could say, well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation.",,INFO
Potential.,,CAT
"I mean that's, that's the key right there. Potential.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Now, are they, are they rehabilitative or, or not.",,INFO
"Now that's all fine and well and, and, uh, good philosophical.",,INFO
"But if you're involved yourself, personally",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, I know I have a friend whose, uh, son was murdered, uh, on the night before his sixteenth birthday.",,INFO
"And let me tell you, uh, I, I knew them personally, uh, not intimately, but quite well",,INFO
"and, uh, you're talking about real trauma. I mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies.",,INFO
I can imagine.,,G_G
"The father, you know,",,INFO
"of course, a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get, I think, in terms of psychological impact.",,INFO
Yes.,,G_G
"Uh, and,",,CAT
Was he murdered?,,QUESTION
Did they find who killed him?,,QUESTION
"Oh, yes.",,CAT
They found him,,INFO
and he is on trial for capital murder.,,INFO
So it hasn't been a long time ago.,,QUESTION
Just recently.,,QUESTION
"Uh, well, actually he has, I, I'm sorry. He was convicted, uh,",,CAT

but,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"That appeals process, I mean, it's what, you know, really, you know, just drags out and out and out.",,INFO

couple of years ago,,INFO

Uh-huh,,CAT

weigh it or whatever,,INFO

the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans.,,INFO

It's amazing how much plastic you generate.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I was amazed at how many cans,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
that we got,,INFO
"because when the kids first went down, I said, that, you know that's great",,INFO
"and I was thinking, you know maybe I'd help supplement it, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
when they turned them in,,INFO
but it's amazing how many cans you go through.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
it really is.,,INFO
And how fast they accumulate.,,INFO
Well all that stuff,,CAT
"and how much, how much we have reduced our waste.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, that we, we're generating a week.",,INFO
"Um, I know our neighbors, when we first went to this bin program said, oh, there's no way, you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week.",,INFO
They were real upset,,INFO
"but they weren't, they were only picking up once a week.",,INFO
"And we said to them, if you recycle, you'll, you know, you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, it's, it's really amazing.",,INFO
"The other thing he does, that my husband a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings.",,INFO
Really.,,CAT
No.,,CAT
"He, he got a little mulcher thing.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
It's just a little attachment for the lawn mower,,INFO
and we mow once a week.,,INFO
"You know, no, no more often then that.",,INFO
"And then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the, on, on, the, uh, the lawn.",,INFO
"And it's amazing,",,INFO
it's amazing.,,INFO
We don't collect any of that,,INFO
"and that, that has cut down a lot in what we throw out.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"we don't e-, we don't catch it either, mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard.",,INFO
"So, if it mows, gets mowed, I do it normally.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it.,,INFO
.,,CAT
It's too heavy.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So I just m-, I just mow it and leave it.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It just soaks in.,,INFO
Sure it does.,,CAT
Sure it does.,,CAT
It really does,,INFO
"and it,",,CAT
actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"if you're not, uh, if you're catching your grass clippings.",,INFO
"That, that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn.",,INFO
It's amazing.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, I like it better doing it.",,INFO

"It's, it's really not that much trouble.",,INFO
"We keep a large plastic, uh, just a, you know, a garbage bag in the garage.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And as soon as we use something, you know, we crush it up and put it out there",,INFO
"and then, you know, every few weeks we have recycling, a recycling center like near Wal-Mart.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"They're, they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in",,INFO
and it's really no trouble.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"And, uh, I feel like at least we're doing something.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, , um, I read a book one time or a m-, a magazine article",,INFO
"and they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution, it seems like a small contribution",,INFO
but it's not.,,INFO
"If everyone were to recycle just their newspapers, they would s-, save thousands and thousands of trees a day.",,INFO
Really.,,CAT
"A day, just from not throwing out your newspapers.",,INFO
"And, uh, when you read that you think, well gee, maybe it is a big deal,",,INFO

you know.,,INFO
"What, what makes me sick is, is when they show the dump sites",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"you know, and, and, how big they are.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Or like in New York, the barges that",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"that go up and down the, the river",,INFO

it's like ugh.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"And that's, and that's really not necessary.",,INFO
No.,,CAT
It really isn't,,INFO
if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference.,,INFO
It would make a huge impact.,,INFO
"So, I'm excited about the recycling program in Plano",,INFO
"I, I, can't wait for them to get it started.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Um, because it'll be that much easier for us,",,INFO
"you know, like I said, now we have to take it over to, to Wal-Mart.",,INFO
It would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It, it's",,INFO
Um,,CAT
it's convenient out here for them to do it.,,INFO
"Now what, what do they pick up?",,QUESTION
"It's just,",,CAT
"They pick up the, the plastic, the glass, and the newspaper.",,INFO
Oh they do?,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And do you have to sort that?,,QUESTION
"And they will do the alum-,",,INFO
Or do you just put it all in.,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
you just put it in the one bin,,INFO
"and, and I guess they do the sorting.",,INFO
"But, um, they'll do the aluminum cans too",,INFO
but we don't give them those,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
The kids keep those,,INFO
"So,",,CAT
So you're doing that now?,,QUESTION
You're doing the newspapers and the glass?,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Well,,INFO

"we don't, we don't take the newspaper to begin with. When, neither one of us are home t-,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
to read it.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So we don't have the newspapers but the, the plastic and the glass",,INFO
"At first, when it first started, it, it, it was hard.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, because you're just used to throwing things.",,INFO
"My husband would,",,INFO
.,,CAT
come home and go through the trash,,INFO
Uh!,,G_G
"and say, you threw this away",,INFO
.,,CAT
"He would get, he would get all upset",,INFO
"and I'd say,",,INFO
it's just such an automatic reaction.,,INFO
And now,,INFO
It is.,,CAT
we think before we throw anything away.,,INFO
"I mean, it's really funny.",,INFO
"We, we really,",,INFO
"once you get into the habit of it, it's okay,",,INFO
"it's just, it's just making it a habit that's hard",,INFO
"Oh, I know.",,G_G
"Well the kids have even got to the point where they, if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can, you know, they, they're, oh, no, don't do that",,INFO
"and they go to the sink, they rinse them out, and they put them upside down, they let them drain",,INFO
and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and then, uh, after a couple of days they take them all outside",,INFO
"and, I put them in a big bag anyway",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and then they dump the bag out,,INFO
and then they crush them.,,INFO
So that's,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
their activity thing. To go out there and crush.,,INFO

Oh.,,CAT

Uh-huh.,,CAT
I don't know what you think about all that.,,QUESTION
"Well, uh, yo-, I, uh, I'm kind of young.",,INFO
I'm only twenty-two,,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, although I have a",,CAT
"I, I kind of wonder uh, if some, if it were possible to market some, uh, form of, uh, space technology, you know, to, uh, uh, to make it equitable, it might severely help the economy, you know, in the, in the, uh, respect that you know, there's endless amounts of research to be done. Endless amounts of resources and *",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and whatnot,",,INFO
it would be great,,INFO
"Well, *",,CAT
"if we could find some way to, to, uh, use that to boost the economy.",,INFO
Yeah.,,INFO
"Well, the, uh, uh,",,CAT
"I've always, uh, felt that, uh, uh, one of the long-term solutions that, at least a few of our problems would be to have, uh, some sort of, uh, solar power satellites up.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, because that's a, uh, you know, in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it, that doesn't require, uh, uh, any particularly nasty environment impact.",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
And you can just get as much power as you need up there.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
It's just a matter of how big you build it.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, and, of course, the side effects of this is that you have to have, uh, lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing.",,INFO
"So the side effects of doing that which I think would be good, you know, very, very good for al-, for everyone in the long run is, uh, is it, some of the other things I'd like to see happen would happen also,",,INFO
"so I'm,",,CAT
Right.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"It seems like, uh, there's,",,CAT
so you're talking about positive side effects then.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"Okay,",,CAT
I understand.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, *",,CAT
"Sure,",,G_G
that makes a lot of sense.,,G_G
Right.,,INFO
"The only problem is, of course, that, uh, that requires significant commitment",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And they want to do the research,,INFO
and,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, they're all you know, nor-,",,INFO
"the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like, uh, the trip to Mars.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
"Which is, would, would produce some useful scientific research and so forth,",,INFO
"but the same money could probably be far better spent on, uh, uh, lunar bases and solar power satellite research and, you know, so forth.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"It, it would de-, it would be being done for the, uh, glitz and show factor",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"to get politician votes instead of, instead of for, you know,",,INFO
"we should eventually send someone, people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"We should do it because, for, for the return we get for it.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, unfortunately, that's not what I thinks happened *",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
"Least not,",,CAT
"I, I would settle for the gli-, for the glitz if the side effects were useful, like the, uh,",,INFO
"but, uh",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"the downside of that is you, after you do one of those, people say well we did it.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Now let's,,INFO
Now we're done.,,INFO
now we're done,,INFO

"No need to use this anymo-, to play around with this space stuff anymore.",,INFO
That's what happened with Apollo.,,INFO

doctorate degree in computer science center at Berkeley,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And they're asking like for a, uh, G P A of like three point seven or something",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
like that.,,INFO
"And like they're looking like for, uh, G R E like ninety-nine percentile and this and that.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And it's like,",,CAT
"Well, that's what they look for.",,INFO
"Whether or not they get it is hard to say * spelling: ""dragged"", not ""drug"" in this case",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I know.,,INFO
"That's why, that's why I didn't apply.",,INFO
"I mean, it was like",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"for me, it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"ninety-nine percentile on the, on the verbal part.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It's pretty tough.,,INFO
It's pretty tough,,CAT
"I,",,CAT
"uh, let's face it, you know.",,CAT
"And, you know, I, you know, did the, you know,",,CAT
"as far as,",,CAT
"I found it a lot of times with, regards to education, you know, the school only takes you so far, you know.",,INFO
It's what you do.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You know.,,INFO
"So, uh, I don't lose any sleep, sleep over stuff like that.",,INFO
"So, are, are you going to go for your Doctorate?",,QUESTION
Probably not.,,CAT
See I'm in the Navy.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, you know, most of the Navy funds that I probably won't do it until I,",,INFO
"if I do do it, it will be after I get out of the Navy.",,INFO
When do you get out?,,QUESTION
"Oh, probably be another twelve years.",,INFO
"Oh, okay",,CAT

Excuse me?,,CAT
What if they pay for?,,QUESTION
If they pay for a P H D?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Nah,",,CAT
they won't pay for it.,,INFO
"They've, I think they have maybe two people a year go get, get their P H D.",,INFO
"Because I know, I know a couple of people here that work for, uh, the Army. Uh,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"They civilians or, uh, military?",,QUESTION
"I think, I think they're military.",,INFO
"But, I",,INFO

And so he's getting that,,INFO
"and, uh",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
they said like they got a lot of benefits and that.,,INFO
That's why you want to join.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, uh, this guy,",,CAT
I mean you can earn a lot more money,,INFO
"so you say,",,CAT
"I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money, once you've get your, your, your Masters.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"They go, well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Well, a lot of times it's, you know, a lot of times it's not the money that keeps pe-, that keeps people in .",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"They, they like what they're doing.",,INFO
"They, you know, they feel good about what they're doing.",,INFO
That type of thing.,,CAT
It's more,,CAT
"But I mean, I mean, you,",,CAT
"the,",,CAT
"once you get your Masters, you can be earning between, anywhere between like thirty-seven, forty-five thousand a year.",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
And,,INFO
"Oh, easily,",,CAT
I'm sure.,,INFO
and that's not what they're paying.,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"Well, it depends on what rank you are, of course",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
I know,,INFO
"I mean, like I say, if you're, if you're, you know, if you're at an upper level in the rank category, you know, you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But that's, uh,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Those are few and far between though.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It's like,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"it's like, uh, in I B M.",,INFO
"In I B M, you can get certain points",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, everyone's a manager.",,INFO
"But nobody can get one more point to become, you know, like whatever you need to earn so much money.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Since I imagine it's fairly competitive.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It's like,",,CAT
no,,CAT
"I, I mean, I B M is like,",,INFO
"there's a joke about I B M which says, you know, it's like, uh,",,INFO
"all, all the major companies get into a, a boating race, right?",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And so, I B M says well we have, we have to have a team, right.",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
And then they come in last,,INFO
"and they have this whole team, you know, analyze why they came in last right. Because the person asked for it.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Saying,",,CAT
"he goes, uh, the problem was that there were five people saying row, row, row and one person rowing, right.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"So he goes, have you come up with a -lution, uh, have you come up with a solution?",,INFO
"They go, yeah,",,INFO
change the rower,,INFO
"You know, it's like everyone's a,",,INFO
.,,CAT
manager,,INFO
"but, you know, it's like",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
only use like one person does the work,,INFO
so.,,CAT
Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
So.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"that can be, that, that can really slow you down.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, that's the way it works.",,INFO
"I mean, that's, that's why they're having problems.",,INFO
"I mean, everyone's a manager",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
I didn't realize that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, it's like, it's like the people that actually do the work there",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"are, uh, very few.",,INFO
"And then the other people just plan it, you know.",,INFO
"It's like, it's like have you, have",,QUESTION
push paper around.,,INFO
"have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the, with, uh, the think tank?",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know,",,INFO
"like all these people are just standing, sitting around, just going, you know, like what shall we do?",,INFO
Has anybody thought of anything?,,INFO
.,,CAT
No.,,INFO
"And then this guy from Federal, Federal Express comes along.",,INFO
They go what's that? This track which it's going around the world,,INFO
"and they can tell you where your package is anywhere, any time.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And so it's like the same thing with I B M. You know,",,INFO
so they have this think tank.,,INFO
And they got to come up with ideas.,,INFO
"But, see, uh, the, the thing is, that I B M is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"They've got a, they've got basically a, uh, you know, a lock on a lot of the market.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And a lot of times you figure, you know, with the support that they provide, you know,",,INFO
"people generally go with that because they figure that the, you know, you probably won't get fired for getting I B M material.",,INFO
"Whereas if you try something different, they'll",,INFO
And it fails,,INFO
and you're dead.,,INFO
"they'll say yeah,",,INFO
"why didn't you buy, why didn't you try something more mainline.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Well I B M doesn't fire anybody.,,INFO
Because,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"uh, what they do is they, they put you in a different job.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Which y-, you actually are like sitting around not doing anything.",,INFO
So you quit.,,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
I mean that's their policy.,,INFO
They never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally.,,INFO
"Illegal or something like that,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
But they won't let you off.,,INFO
What they'll do is like,,INFO
"suppose, you know, like you're a manager.",,INFO
So they'll put,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you into keeping up the paper, you know.",,INFO
It's like how much paper is going in?,,INFO
And then you,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"say that's not my job,",,INFO
so you quit.,,INFO
"So, in other words, that's the way they force",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
people out,,INFO
"That's why they can say, you know, there's no layoff",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
policy.,,INFO
"But it does-, they don't really say that, you know,",,INFO
"you're, you're always going to have great career",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
conditions.,,INFO
"He-, hey, that's kind of sad.",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"but I mean, it's like, it's like they, they have just like different policy.",,INFO
I don't know.,,CAT
My dad works for them,,INFO
"but it's like I B M like never in their commercials, they never put down any other company, you know.",,INFO
It's like,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"they won't say,",,INFO
"Well, they're the standard right now.",,INFO
"Or as far as that goes, you know, people think of computers, they think of I B M a lot of times.",,INFO
"And the main,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Because see what happens is they have a good backup policy.,,INFO
.,,CAT
And anybody can fix it.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And so that's what you're going to go for.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, you know, that's, that's a, that's a big thing.",,INFO
"And, and, you know, it's like, for example, like Leading Edge.",,INFO
Have you ever heard of Leading Edge?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
They are out of Korea right.,,QUESTION
What?,,CAT
Leading Edge.,,INFO
"Don't they pro-,",,QUESTION
"They, they made like, uh, small personal computers.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Small P C -s.,,CAT
they're out of Korea right?,,QUESTION
I don't know.,,CAT
I don't know.,,INFO
"But what they do is, what they did, I don't know, is buy all the parts that I B M would throw away.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And build an I B M P C with all the parts that I B M would throw away.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"for example, you test a chip.",,INFO
It can't last seven years,,INFO
but it can last five.,,INFO
I B M says let's throw it away.,,INFO
Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"And so that's,",,CAT
"I mean, they're still around I think.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I've seen, well I've seen them around anyway. You know .",,INFO
"So, that's what they do.",,INFO
"They buy all, all the things that I B M throws away",,INFO
"and they , and that's why they're so compatible.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Because I mean,,INFO
"and by the time you have computer for five years, you're going to throw it away anyway. You know.",,INFO
Most people do.,,INFO
Or they have to anyway.,,INFO
"Well, I mean, there's like, well",,CAT
"in a way you realize,",,CAT
"I mean, one t-, one of my teachers got this computer which, you know,",,INFO
"it's like, uh, voice, uh, synthesizing stuff.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And he got that.,,INFO
"He said, you know, it's like, uh,",,INFO
"I was testing it * LISTEN to this sequence that begins here and ends with A.215 utt 11. I can't tell how much Speaker A is quoting, and how much he'she is directly addressing Speaker B.",,CAT
and it was wonderful.,,INFO
"And then when you tried to erase and correct, you know, all the errors in your voice, it takes up all your memory.",,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"And I want more, you know.",,INFO
"And it's like Jesus Christ, you know,",,INFO
it's like why do you want more.,,INFO
Because it's like one second of recording.,,INFO
I mean you put into Wave,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and you want to correct the errors into Wave,",,INFO
"it takes so much,",,INFO
"I mean, it's like,",,INFO
of course it does.,,INFO
"I mean, by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model",,INFO
"and you put it in there,",,INFO
and you want to correct those.,,INFO
"And then, you know, you're trying to make the, the Wave smooth",,INFO
"so you can approximately,",,INFO
of course it's going to take a lot.,,INFO
"Imagine, imagine",,INFO
It's amazing.,,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
"what it is for us to make mark off models, you know.",,INFO
"It's like, Jesus Christ.",,INFO
"Well, when you get, you know, when you get right down to it, the, uh, the more they can do for you, the more, uh, like I say, the more, the more memory they're going to require.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Both, both in terms in Ram as well as, uh, you know, standard",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"memory or disk mem-, disk base,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Well, like they say, like nobody can get enough, you know.",,INFO
"It's like once you have something,",,INFO
and it's like,,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"You find out more,",,INFO
I was watching this program on T V yesterday.,,INFO
In nineteen seventy-six,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
NASA came up with Three D graphics.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And they were showing this like Three D g-, Three D graphics view of like,",,INFO
Like the deal?,,QUESTION
What?,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
no.,,CAT
Like a hologram?,,QUESTION
"This is like, this is like",,INFO
"With just graphics on, on a,",,INFO
video game stuff.,,INFO
Okay?,,QUESTION
Okay,,CAT
"But the only thing was, that it was just lines,",,INFO
okay.,,CAT
Like if you,,CAT
,,
"Well, uh, it seems to me that, uh, that",,INFO
"I do not know whether the jury system, uh,",,INFO
"I, I should not say I do not know.",,INFO
"I do not feel very, uh, stronger that the jury system should be changed.",,INFO
"It seems to have worked, uh, time immemorial.",,INFO
"And when, uh, difficult decisions, uh, are made, uh, uh, uh, they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I know in some cases now in some states, depending on the criminal code, uh, a unanimous verdict is not required.",,INFO
"And indeed some juries are no longer twelve people,",,INFO
"they are down to as little, as small as six people in, I think, in petty, in, in, uh, in, uh, in minor felonies, and, uh, and misdemeanor trials.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing, simply because, uh, there is always, uh, there is,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"there is always a jury that might be swayed, uh, by the moment, uh, to either to be too lenient or too vengeful, I guess.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"On the other hand, uh, attorney, uh, uh, justices are more apt to, uh, understand, you know, the cr-, the prison crowding problems and things like that,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and have that sway their decisions one way or the other.,,INFO
"But, I mean, is not that,",,QUESTION
You know.,,INFO
"uh, is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world?",,INFO
"If, if, if they keep giving everybody hundred year sentences, and the people in various states, it does not seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons. Or even in, for that matter, uh, repair the, uh, the lack of judges and, and, and other, uh,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I think that is what is happening.,,INFO
"I think, uh, the judges are trying to save the people from having to,",,INFO
.,,CAT
the cost of new prisons.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"They,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"you know, that might be it.",,CAT
"I mean, they,",,CAT
"they are saying,",,INFO
"they certainly,",,INFO
"oh, well, you know,",,INFO
"I do not,",,INFO
"the, the people cannot",,INFO
I don't know how,,INFO
afford it.,,INFO
"it is in Virginia,",,INFO
"but in Florida now, uh, uh, uh, at eighteen years, someone was just sentenced to eighteen years, I heard it on TODAY, uh, without any specific recommendation for, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, waving the normal, uh, procedures.",,INFO
"And the eighteen years will, uh, translate into something like, uh, four point seven, if every, if the, if the prisoner is a model prisoner,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and indeed the present overcrowding conditions, uh, prevail.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Plus, I guess, there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So, uh, yeah,",,CAT
you might be right about that.,,INFO
"I, I, I do not know,",,CAT
"it just seems to me that only about, uh, from what I read, only about ninety percent of the ca-, only about ten percent of the pa-, cases come for trial anyway.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, uh, only about, uh, f-, four or five percent of, uh,",,INFO
"in the, in the very end",,CAT
"or less than, less than half the trials that go to, uh, less than half the cases that go to trial, uh, end up w-, with,",,INFO
With a conviction?,,INFO
"uh, with the jury actually making the verdict.",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"That most of it is plea bargained, uh, half way through",,INFO
"or, or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"But, uh, uh, how do you feel about the, uh, about the jury system itself?",,QUESTION
"Do you, do you think that should be changed?",,QUESTION
"Or do you, do you know in Virginia whether it is, if they have smaller juries",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Uh, I do not know exactly what the size of the juries.",,INFO
"I know one of my friends was, uh, uh, brought up for jury duty.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"For,",,CAT
"and he only heard very, you know, piddly type cases.",,INFO
"Most of it was, uh, robberies or things like that, you know,",,INFO
it was not any serious crimes.,,INFO
"So apparently even for the smallest crimes, they give the person the, you know, any felony anyways.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I guess we,",,CAT
"Th-, they give the person the option for a jury.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I guess we always focus on criminal trials with th-, with the jury.",,INFO
"But I know you have a right to ask for a jury in,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"in any sort of a case that even where damages are, are, are, uh, are the result of some sort of a, uh, an action that you are bringing against someone else. You can ask",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
for that to be heard before a jury.,,INFO
"Takes a heck of a long time, I guess, to get there",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
in some states.,,INFO
"I, I, I do not know, uh,",,CAT
"I should imagine Virginia, from what I read, uh, uh, is like every other state.",,INFO
"It, it is faced with, uh, uh, enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system.",,INFO
"Because I guess,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
everywhere I read that there is a shortage of judges.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Not that they won't appoint them,,INFO
"but there is no budget for them, I guess.",,INFO
"Or,",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the clerk, uh,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Whatever.,,INFO
court clerks.,,INFO
"So it seems, uh,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
"I, I, I do not think I would change it.",,INFO
"The more I verbalize it, I, I do not think I would want to change the system.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
I do not,,INFO
"uh, I do not think I would either.",,INFO
know what we would replace it with,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I know,",,CAT
"it, uh, does seem like the, the, the, the purpose of getting people in jail so that, you know, the, the,",,INFO
I cannot think of the word I am looking for.,,INFO
"Anyway, the deterrent.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"For people to, to commit the cri-, uh, to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away.",,INFO
"People have,",,CAT
"I do not know,",,CAT
they just do not care any more.,,INFO
"The benefit, I guess, of crime outweighs what the deterrent is.",,INFO
"Uh, and yet",,INFO
"You know, people that,",,CAT
"there are, there are so many, there are so many people in prison.",,INFO
"I mean the prison population, uh, as far as I, I, uh, you know,",,INFO
"my impression of it is that it has, that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"I mean it,",,INFO
"so has our, I guess our population has grown some too.",,INFO
"But there, there definitely is, uh, uh, you know, to me the, one of the worst things that could ever happen, uh, from what I read and see and understand.",,INFO
I mean I do no think I could handle prison.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I mean it would be,,INFO
"Well, I would be interested in",,INFO
"very difficult,",,INFO
"finding out what the, uh, percentage of drug related type things are,",,INFO
"Well, there must be a,",,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
"ca-, a, a, a very great degree of that.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, but there again I, I do not know if the, the jury system itself, uh, comes in to play there.",,INFO
"I would think that,",,CAT
"one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability,",,INFO
"of course th-, it is a constitutional right that the press must have here, is th-, the interviewing of jurors after the trial.",,INFO
"I mean that, it seems to me that, that, that when a jury makes a decision, they should not be asked, uh, before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision.",,INFO
"I mean, I do not,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I imagine there is a certain, certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that.",,INFO
"But I, I would think I, if I did anything, I would protect the juror from, from any sort of an inquisition after",,INFO
"Well, I know, uh,",,CAT
"on the other hand though, when, uh-, after the Barry trial,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"up here, you know, the big local",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"trial,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Well,",,INFO
as well as national.,,INFO
I do a lot of business up in Washington.,,INFO
"I was there during the, during the trial actually,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
And the opposite was true of me.,,INFO
"Uh, after the case was over, I was like, somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way they did,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
you know,,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"It was like, well, a picture is not good enough.",,INFO
"We want to see,",,INFO
I do not know what they wanted honestly,,INFO
"Did they want the guy to, I do not know. *",,QUESTION
"I mean, just because you feel like he was being kicked on, which he certainly was, you know.",,INFO
"I think, I,",,CAT
no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be,,INFO
"Oh, I felt that way.",,CAT
prosecuted.,,INFO
"I felt,",,INFO
But,,INFO
"I felt,",,INFO
it does not matter.,,INFO
The guy was obviously,,INFO
"no,",,CAT
"but,",,CAT
guilty,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"I always balanced in the, in the situation.",,INFO
"I remember the jurors, uh,",,INFO
"I thought to myself, how did, how did",,INFO
"they only, I think they only, uh, found him",,INFO
"One, one count.",,INFO
"guilty on one count. Which was, uh, not even, which was a class something felony. Which was not even punishable,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, uh, to the degree that they thought it.",,INFO
"But I do not know,",,CAT
"maybe when you are there in the r-, in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got to make a judgment on somebody.",,INFO
"And the prosecutors do a lousy job,",,INFO
or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it.,,INFO
"I mean, I,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I am not making excuses for,,INFO
That might be it.,,INFO
"Well, yeah.",,CAT
"I think we are getting,",,INFO
I think I am getting a call coming in.,,INFO
Oh Okay.,,CAT
"All right, nice",,G_G
"Well, it has been nice",,G_G
talking with you.,,INFO
talking,,INFO
Thank you.,,G_G
to you.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"well, go ahead,",,COMMAND
I'll let you start.,,INFO
"Uh, I was thinking about whether or not we should have people, uh, be required to do public service for a year or two.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family,",,INFO
or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to.,,INFO
"I mean, you can't make it everybody.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and, and maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"or it could be like the draft where, you know, before they draft you, they ta-, uh, you get a physical anyway.",,INFO
So when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical,,INFO
"and if there's nothing physically wrong with you, then you're drafted.",,INFO
It doesn't matter how rich you are.,,INFO
.,,CAT
That would be good.,,CAT
"And then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members,",,INFO
right.,,QUESTION
What did you say?,,CAT
Give physicals to the rest of the family members,,CAT
and they all had to pass.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT

Uh.,,CAT
"Uh, I thought it a good idea too, though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"And, uh, if they did this, maybe help them out in their college cost",,INFO

"so they co-, could subsist.",,INFO
Well that's true.,,CAT
"America's paying all this money to have other people give, uh, aid to other countries,",,INFO
so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Because, actually, when you, when you do, uh, service overseas you end up learning something, usually that's, that's really useful, plumbing, or farming, or, or something like that,",,INFO
so you're really learning a skill,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and you know all these old people, they would get out of this right.",,INFO
All the ones that are already retired.,,INFO
So what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country.,,INFO
What did you say?,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I'm just teasing,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I, think, well that's probably the idea,",,INFO
"I don't know whether the idea is to be within the country, or outside the country.",,INFO
Well I thought it would be a good idea if maybe you took some of the kids and had them go over to other countries,,INFO
"and children from their countries came over to ours too, a trade off.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that would be neat,",,INFO
yeah,,CAT
sort of like an exchange program.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And other than that, I can't think of any other ideas.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that'd be sort of neat.,,CAT

We're still using those things.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT

"Uh, uh, I'm glad they have a lot of, uh, um, you know, topics on social services, because, like this thing, this is a pretty good idea.",,INFO
I didn't even know if they were thinking about it.,,INFO
"I wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone, somewhere is really thinking, that, uh, it would be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service.",,INFO
There is somebody,,INFO
"and I, , uh, I can't remember who it is",,INFO
"but there's a really famous,",,INFO

"Yeah,",,CAT
he started that,,INFO

Do you?,,QUESTION

read the little book they send you,,INFO

Right,,CAT
"But I guess when I hear, when I see the comparison between the United States and, uh, any other western country, uh, their, their rates are like, uh, forty-one, forty-two and ours are like thirty-six, thirty-seven, you know,",,INFO
"if you compute as a percentage of total income, all taxes lumped together, we actually do pretty well.",,INFO
"T-, th-, there's no other country that's, that is taxed as low as we are.",,INFO
"Well and I still think that, having lived in Europe for awhile, you know, difference in living conditions",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"are certainly well worth, uh, what we pay for it.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I'm, I'm not sure I understand what you mean.",,INFO
"Well, I mean, I think,",,INFO
"I was in Germany, you know, for several years",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and I'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have, then have to live there.",,INFO
"Oh, you mean, lowest end of living in spite of lower, higher taxes.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Higher taxes.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I suppose that's true,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, probably m-, less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
Still's that way to some extent.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think the other problem is, you know, it, it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you, theoretically, can do something about.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"But I look, for example,",,CAT
and you're not quite in the same situation,,INFO
but like school taxes for me,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
biggest bargain in the world.,,INFO
"I wish I didn't have to pay any more fo-, to my physicians in a year",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
than I had to pay for all of my school taxes.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"since, uh, I send my kids to parochial school, that .",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that, that's probably a little tougher on you",,INFO
"It's not, it's not quite the bargain that .",,CAT
.,,CAT
"But, I mean, I pay them gladly.",,INFO
"That's a decision,",,INFO
"I think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a, uh, two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools f-, with the same tax money.",,INFO
"But, uh, I mean, that's, that's the way Americans want to interpret it,",,INFO
I guess that's all right,,INFO
"But,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"I,",,CAT
.,,CAT
"and if I were, uh,",,CAT
"when I was single and again when I'm retired,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"I will not mind paying, uh, what it takes to keep the schools good.",,INFO
That's always been a high priority,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
I think that's just you though.,,INFO
"I do,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"I think in places,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"I think in places like California, people are beginning to find that in, in areas that are fairly well off, if you add the, uh, uh, people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are, uh, just looking for fun, th- people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh,",,INFO
.,,CAT
there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done.,,INFO
"That seems a, a, like a cultural lapse.",,INFO
"I mean, people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools.",,INFO
"They,",,CAT
"Of course, I think with the graying of America, we're going to see that problem in lots of places.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"People would rather, uh, increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them.",,INFO
But I think it's sad,,INFO
Or build roads.,,INFO
selfish and shortsighted.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Well,",,CAT
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"uh, I guess our topic is about movies",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, what is coincidence,",,INFO
we got a baby-sitter,,INFO
and we went to the movies that past weekend.,,INFO
"Oh, so did I",,INFO
And we saw CAPE FEAR.,,INFO
"Oh, I heard that was excellent.",,INFO
It is.,,CAT
Is it?,,QUESTION
It's really good.,,CAT
"Uh, I wanted to see that",,INFO
"I was deciding between that and, uh, MY GIRL",,INFO
"and, uh, my boyfriend and I went to see MY GIRL.",,INFO
"Oh, how was that?",,QUESTION
"Oh, it was excellent.",,INFO
"It was a really, really good movie.",,INFO
I'd recommend it.,,INFO
"I heard that's, a movie that, uh, you really can't take children.",,INFO
Is that true?,,QUESTION
"Uh, I heard the opposite that, uh, you should take children to see it.",,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
"Uh, there were quite a few, uh, kids in there with their parents.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, I don't know, though,",,CAT
"I, I've heard that, and then what you just told me",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"because, uh, the little boy dies.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
It was sad.,,INFO
It was really sad.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"But, uh, his, it kind of shows how his, uh, best friend, this little girl, deals with his death",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"and how, I think, maybe, how children should deal with death.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
Maybe.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, it was really good.",,INFO
"It was sad, very sad.",,INFO
"Oh, I want to see that one.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Well, CAPE FEAR was, was more suspenseful.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It was really suspenseful.,,INFO
"So that, that's, that's a real good movie to see.",,INFO
"I heard it was, uh, sort of like, uh, not, uh, too violent,",,INFO
"but it was kind of like, uh, gross, kind of like, uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, like.",,INFO
"Uh, no,",,CAT
"and it, uh, it was kind of,",,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"it's kind of both, I guess,",,INFO
"but it's not, it's not as bad as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.",,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
"But, uh, it's just as suspenseful, I think.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And it, it was a real good movie.",,INFO
And then we saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
Because we have two kids.,,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
And FIEVEL GOES WEST,,INFO
"Oh, I've seen, uh, previews for them on T V,",,INFO
"but I,",,CAT
"But, uh, those were, those were okay,",,INFO
"so,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And then, oh, boy, it's been, it's been so long since we've been to the movies,",,INFO
"but I, we've rented some videos.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"I like to rent movies, too.",,INFO
"And I think the last one I rented was, uh, MORTAL THOUGHTS",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
with Demi Moore.,,INFO
"Oh, I, I didn't see that.",,INFO
"And, uh, that, that, that's okay.",,INFO
That's pretty good.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, and, uh, WHAT ABOUT BOB?",,INFO
I have seen that,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"at the theatres,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
we rented that one.,,INFO
"That, that was cute.",,INFO
"And, uh, uh, I guess that's about it.",,INFO
Have you rented any movies lately?,,QUESTION
"Uh, the last movie I rented was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox",,CAT
"and, uh,",,CAT
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
that was good.,,INFO
"We rented that one, too.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I liked that.,,INFO
I like Michael J. Fox a lot.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
He's one of my favorites.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I like his movies.,,INFO
"So, do you go to the movies often,",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
not too often.,,INFO
"I, I hadn't been to the movies for a really long time",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
since last weekend.,,INFO
"But, uh, there's been movies out that I've been wanting to see.",,INFO
"I just, you know, don't get a chance to get out and see them.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"well, we have two little kids,",,INFO
so it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies.,,INFO
We have to dig up a baby-sitter,,INFO
and,,INFO
Oh I see.,,CAT
"And that's only the only time we can go out,",,INFO
so our time is scarce.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
.,,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
"But, uh, we, we, we t-, we, you know, we're, we're big movie people",,INFO
and,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
we try and do,,INFO
"and I don't, I don't know about the last movie I've seen on T V that was real good. Uh,",,INFO
"Oh, I watched that movie with, uh, Barbara, uh, uh,",,INFO
what was her name.,,CAT
"Oh, Bar-,",,CAT
"that, uh, her sister got killed",,INFO
"and, uh, she had a baby.",,INFO
The husband was a dentist,,INFO
and he had murdered her.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"uh,",,INFO
"That was, that was pretty good.",,INFO
"Bertinelli, or what's her name.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"uh-huh,",,CAT
"oh, Valerie Bertinelli.",,INFO
"I can't,",,CAT
"That's it,",,G_G
yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
yeah,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that was real good,",,CAT
"I saw that one, uh, two part series,",,INFO
and I heard it was a true story.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think that was probably the last movie I've seen, too.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, and then I saw that other movie about, uh, MOTHER, DAUGHT-, MOTHER, WIFE, MURDERER.",,INFO
Did you see that one?,,QUESTION
"Oh, uh, with, uh, Judith Light?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh,",,CAT
"Did you see that one,",,QUESTION
"that was, was really good.",,INFO
"That was supposed to be a true story, too.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I did see that.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I did.,,CAT
"That was on a while ago, wasn't it?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
I saw that.,,INFO
Guess a couple weeks ago or something like that.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that was pretty good.,,CAT
Boy,,INFO
"I,",,CAT
we have,,INFO
.,,CAT
"we, we see all the same movies.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I like, uh, the true stories.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
They're more interesting.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And it's hard to believe that, you know, this really happened.",,INFO
I know.,,CAT
Some of them are pretty bad.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But,",,CAT
Huh. Well,,INFO
.,,CAT
We sure do have a lot in common.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"If you're ever in town, we'll go see a movie",,COMMAND
Okay,,CAT
"But, and we don't really,",,CAT
"d-, do you all have, do you all still have drive-ins up there",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
do you have them there?,,QUESTION
"Um, well, we may have just a couple over here.",,CAT
,,
"So, Julie, how do you feel about AIDS research?",,QUESTION
"I think we need, we definitely need more of it, definitely.",,INFO
"I'd agree, too,",,CAT
"but, I mean, it seems like it just makes economic sense in that, you know, uh, you know,",,INFO
"it would have made even better economic sense to, to, to have had a lot more research than a l-, l-, longer ago.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
for certain.,,CAT
"You know, because, you know, because, uh, the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients.",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Exactly.,,CAT
"Does, does like, d-, do health insurance policies, like, for companies and things, do they cover diseases like that?",,QUESTION
"I think they cover AIDS,",,CAT
"but what they do is, uh, if, you know, you apply for, for to get a, a insurance policy",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"they'll, uh, check to see if you're H I V positive",,INFO
"and if you are, not only will they not give you, uh, a policy,",,INFO
"but they'll, uh, they have like,",,CAT
"there's like, you know, a database of people that have tested positive,",,INFO
so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again.,,INFO
"Um, well, that's, but that's why they should have s-, started doing stuff before.",,INFO
"I mean, still, you know, since it's dormant for such a long time, there's still probably a lot of people, you know, before the tests ever really came out",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"who are, who are draining a lot of money right now. You know,",,INFO
"I think a lot of it was, was just that, you know, becau-, because of, of the, audi-, you know, because, because the majority of the high risk groups were people",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
no one really cared about.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"That,",,CAT
"Right,",,CAT
"and all these God-fearing people were like, well, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"God is trying to kill off all the et cetera, et cetera .",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"uh, yeah,",,CAT
"one, one, one h-, one humorous retort I heard, heard someone, you know, who claimed that, you know, AIDS was, you know, God's punishment",,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"was that, then lesbians must be God's chosen people.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh,",,CAT
"Boy,",,G_G
that's a good one.,,G_G
.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"So, uh,",,CAT
Yes?,,CAT
"Uh, do you think, d-, you mean, do you actually think we're doing enough right now to,",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
I really don't.,,INFO
"I did, I did like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff,",,INFO
"and, uh, really we're not doing much at all,",,INFO
"I mean, most of what gets raised, I mean, it's not really federal movement, most of what gets raised, gets raised by, uh, uh, you know,",,INFO
Private organizations.,,INFO
"conscious, yeah, communities and things like that, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Like, uh, San Francisco has a, a real, uh, strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff",,INFO
and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, get, they get donations from the community, you know, they're real,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And from corporations around the, around the city, you know, for AIDS research and that kind of thing",,INFO
"and, uh, I think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level, you know, rather than just in the places where it's, you know, where it's predominated so far, because it's, you know it's",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
bound to spread,,INFO
"I mean, it seems that, you know, it's just, you know, of, it's just going to reach a steady, a steady state a let, a lot, lot higher point than it will if we, you know, we'd nip it in the bud to q-, quote Barney Fife.",,INFO
Right,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"I, I, I don't know what the likelihood of that is,",,INFO
"but, I mean, you know, people really waking up.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Especially with the ultra conservatives,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"move our, our political system s-, sort of seems to be taking.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I would probably agree with that.,,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
"so,",,CAT
"Uh, so do, do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of, uh, people?",,QUESTION
"God,",,CAT
"that's a good question, Fish.",,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"uh, I think, I think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education, not support or, or, research per se, but, but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society, you know, kind of like lepers would",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
you know,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it's really, it's really not necessary, uh, until, until the, disease reaches its final stage, you know, becomes really infectious",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand, you know, try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"they're not, you know, they don't, they don't have to be just completely cut off from, from the community",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and that, and, uh, I don't know,",,CAT
"I guess I think that, that, uh, research is, I guess the most important, just because I, you know, it, it really needs to come to an end.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
You know.,,INFO
I don't know.,,CAT
"I don't know, Fish.",,CAT
What do you think about that subject?,,QUESTION
"I think it's, I think it stands a really interesting question of, uh,",,INFO
,,
There we go.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, uh, I think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than I would expect this time of year.",,INFO
I think that's true.,,CAT
"The, uh, the Bermuda grass is greening up in March,",,INFO
and sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of April.,,INFO
So.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So I think we're a little hea-, ahead of schedule on that.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I was out in my yard yesterday afternoon,",,INFO
"and I noticed all that grass coming up,",,INFO
"and I thought, ooh,",,INFO
we've got to start this mowing bit soon,,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
"It's been a, a fun break,",,INFO
but the break is over.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, um, oh, I guess another thing I've noticed, too, here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days, it's been awfully gray, you know, just,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"now, the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
But it seems like every time at work I look out my window it's gray,,INFO
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
but I'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend.,,INFO
"Oh, I go for that,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"In fact, I'm a little worried about this one coming up here.",,INFO
We have a long weekend,,INFO
"and, it sounds like it's going to be a little bit on the cool side.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I haven't heard whether it's going to rain or not.,,INFO
"I think there's an eighty percent chance this evening,",,INFO
but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow,,INFO
and then the rest will be without rain.,,INFO
"Well, that's good.",,G_G
"But I think the highs are going to be in the sixties, and the lows in the forties.",,INFO
That's getting back to a little bit chillier.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year.,,INFO
"I think,",,CAT
"I haven't seen the wea-, the weather on the news in the evening lately,",,INFO
"but I think the average high would be, should be about seventy.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I'm not certain either,",,INFO
but you're probably right.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, uh, maybe seventy-five to eighty, somewhere in there.",,INFO
I don't like it when it's too cool or too warm.,,INFO
I'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"Um, one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"And what that tells me, is that the summer weather is very predictable, that it doesn't vary very much.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You're probably right.,,INFO
"I mean, any other time of year, that's not the case, because it could be very warm or very cold.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"as a matter of fact, I heard the weather the other day on T V",,INFO
and I think it was one day this week a year ago,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather. You know,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"it wasn't just a super bad storm,",,INFO
but it was,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the, the late spring time.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"One of the weirdest things I saw, I think it was around this time last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm.",,INFO
"Oh, wow.",,G_G
"I, you know, I was going into the grocery store,",,INFO
"and a, a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead,",,INFO
and it was twenty- six degrees out.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"And I thought, Well gee, I've, I've never known it to lightening at that temperature.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that, that is pretty unusual.",,INFO
"And you really take notice of it, too.",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"It, uh, it probably was a lot warmer up high.",,INFO
"Sometimes they get those inversions, like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing.",,INFO
The air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
The cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"I don't, don't like that super cold stuff.",,INFO
Nope.,,CAT
I just don't move very well when it's that cold.,,INFO
"Yep,",,CAT
"I, I'm really enjoying this now.",,INFO
"Well, this has been interesting.",,INFO
"Yeah, well.",,CAT
Not too challenging to the brain.,,INFO
"Not, not a real in depth topic, but",,INFO
Nope.,,CAT
enjoyed talking to you.,,INFO
"All right, Ellen,",,CAT
well you have a good day.,,G_G
Okay.,,G_G
Bye.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
I pushed it.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"So, how do you use your credit cards?",,QUESTION
"Oh, we use them for,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"paying our gas and for paying, uh, just about anything, because, um, we don't like to pay for our checks",,INFO
So we use it quite a bit,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but we, we pay off every month, though,",,INFO
so we never have to pay interest,,INFO
"and we always, we never get the, the credit cards if there's a monthly, or a yearly charge.",,INFO
We always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free.,,INFO
So we never have to pay anything extra.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's me.,,INFO
I won't use one that I have to pay an annual fee,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
we just don't think it's worth it.,,INFO
So.,,CAT
"you know, and, um, I'm, uh, like you. I, I use it, well, to buy my gas with,",,INFO
"my Sh-, my Shell credit card, I use that,",,INFO
"and then like my Emporium card and, uh, Weinstocks card, I use that,",,INFO
but I'm like you.,,INFO
I usually pay it off as soon as I get my bill.,,INFO
"Why I don't just write a check, I don't know.",,INFO
"See, well, you, I don't do it either",,INFO
"You know, it's just really weird,",,INFO
"but I, I don't carry a lot of cash with me, because I'm",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"exactly,",,CAT
"that's how I fe-,",,INFO
"I mean, it's a rare day when I even have seventy-five cents in my purse.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you know, enough for a phone call",,INFO
and that's about all.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, other than that, that's the, that's the way I use them.",,INFO
"I know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got, they c-, they can't charge any more,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
and I think that's terrible.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"because it's really, it helps your, if you have good credit, you know, it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
bigger purchase or something.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"because if anything ever happens that you do need to, you know, you have excellent credit,",,INFO
"why, it really does help.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and I think it's more convenient, too, in a lot of cases,",,INFO
"like whenever we go on trips, we always, you know, use our, our Visa or our Mastercard or whatever.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And then, um, you know, we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it,",,INFO
"we come out a lit-, even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever, first off, and then pay",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"uh-huh,",,CAT
for it later.,,INFO
uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, I think it's better to use credit cards, too, like I say, because yo-, there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket, they're going to hit you over the head.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"even if it's five bucks, even.",,INFO
I know.,,CAT
"It just, uh, you know, it just seems like they're, somebody's always watching.",,INFO
"So, I just don't, I don't carry money.",,INFO
I'd just soon use my credit cards and,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"just pay them off, you know.",,INFO
"And also, if you, if someone did happen to steal your credit card, my husband was saying that if, you know, you notice it within, I think it's twenty-four hours, you can report it in,",,INFO
"and I, he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel, you know, whatever payments you had,",,INFO
and if,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"whoever tried to, uh, you know, credit it to the hilt, you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it,",,INFO
and then,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, you can have your card back with",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"pretty good rating, you know, because you can pay fifty dollars, but not, you know",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
maybe five thousand or whatever.,,INFO
"And, you know, some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything",,INFO
I know.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"I don't know why they don't, unless you have to spend a certain amou-,",,INFO
"I don't know,",,CAT
"but I notice that some of them don't even look, you know,",,INFO
they just slide it in there and pass it back to you,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
so I don't think that's right.,,INFO
"I think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches, you know.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
sure.,,CAT
I mean it's just a precaution for everybody.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
so.,,CAT
"Well, let's see,",,CAT
what else can I say about credit cards.,,CAT
Um.,,CAT
Um.,,CAT
"Oh, I also use, like to use Discover when I can, because they give you some money back every year.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I don't, I don't, uh,",,CAT
"that, that's that Sears Discovery Card,",,QUESTION
is that what that?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Now I don't have that one, you know.",,INFO
"Well, we just started doing that,",,INFO
and,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, what",,INFO
"it comes in handy for when you're buying things like, um, tickets for the train or, um, airplanes",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"because they'll give you some money back, you know,",,INFO
"and it's only a little bit,",,INFO
"but, I mean, it's still something.",,INFO
We got two fifty last year,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"and so it's, you know, it helps out here and there.",,INFO
So.,,CAT
"Oh, you mean, uh, for, for your using your credit card you get like a rebate or something?",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"they give you, I think they start giving you like a half a percent back, which doesn't sound like a thing,",,INFO
"but when you, you know, when you add up everything you've, you've charged up on the Discover card for a year",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they give you a half percent of that,",,INFO
"and that adds up to, you know, two fifty or something.",,INFO
"Oh, I see.",,CAT
"And so that's what,",,CAT
"and I know we're going to get back more this year, because they, you know, we spent a little bit more",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"probably,",,INFO
"and they do it for how long you've been a member I think, too",,INFO
"Um, I see.",,CAT
and they increase the percentage a little bit.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"well, I'll,",,CAT
,,
Hello Ann.,,G_G
Hello Chuck.,,G_G
"Uh, the other day, I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste.",,INFO
"Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.",,INFO
"Well, it's not too new.",,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"So, what what is the E P A recommending now?",,QUESTION
"Oh, they really didn't propose any solutions.",,INFO
"Actually, they were, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down",,INFO
"and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of, of news print.",,INFO
"He was talking about, uh, the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and they could sell it for a while.,,INFO
They were able to sell it for some amount per ton,,INFO
"and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling, they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"That's a, that's a common problem though.",,INFO
"That it seems, that has happened in Dallas as well as New York",,INFO
and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house,,INFO
"and after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either, I suppose.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"We're doing some here in, in Cash Valley, the community here.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"There's, uh, we've actually got a kind of a nice set up.",,INFO
"We've got a couple of plants here that actually take, uh, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and make it into insulation,,INFO
and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside.,,INFO
"Well, that's good.",,G_G
"So one of the real keys, it sounds like, to getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"There has to be, uh, a reuse for it.",,INFO
"I mean, that's why they recycle.",,INFO
"The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that, uh, the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. Uh, everything from, uh, waste baskets to carpet to the no stick, I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days",,INFO
and they're making clothes now that are recycled.,,INFO
Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that.,,INFO
And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama,,INFO
and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government.,,INFO
"One was like, environmental protection",,INFO
"and the other one was, oh, I can't remember what,",,INFO
"but the basic idea, it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing,",,INFO
"he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them.",,INFO
Oh really.,,CAT
"He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling,",,INFO
"but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.,,INFO
"Well, it's carbon",,INFO
"so that makes sense,",,INFO
"like a carbon fuel of some sort,",,INFO
but,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
what,,INFO
And it's more than even paper or something like that.,,INFO
There is more energy in it per pound or whatever.,,INFO
what about emissions?,,INFO
Well that was he didn't deal with that.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
He just said burn it.,,INFO
Okay,,CAT
He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that.,,INFO
So it's not very practical .,,INFO
No.,,CAT
Well it's interesting.,,INFO
"I bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, real interesting.",,INFO
Did it change anything for you?,,QUESTION
"Uh, not too much.",,CAT
"Uh, I got a bit.",,INFO
"Actually,",,CAT
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"All right, uh,",,CAT
feelings on what caused the S and L crisis,,INFO
I guess I don't have a real technical knowledge for what happened,,INFO
I gather that there where large numbers of situations where loans were made that appeared to be a good loan but in a speculative since,,INFO
"and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during the Reagan eight years, uh, more and more S and L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans",,INFO
"and then when they began to collapse one after the other I think almost like an avalanche of, of property values devalued.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
kind of like a domino's effect.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"I don't have a, a field for whether or not this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome.",,INFO
"Oh, .",,CAT
"Uh, scandal,",,INFO
"are you familiar with that,",,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
from your histories lessons or whatever.,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"Uh, I vaguely recall",,INFO
but I've never gone and done any study on it since the S and L thing,,INFO
"that teapot dome scandal is when I think during the Hoover years where gobs of land was, was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it,",,INFO
"and that, that appeared to be corruption within the Hoover administration.",,INFO
"I don't have a real since of, of like corruption that caused S and L all though I have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sourer maybe.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"I don't think it was really corruption that caused it,",,INFO
or within,,CAT
"I think people just started, you know, no-, not being as careful with the loans that they were making whenever, you know, whenever they gave them out.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I think maybe they didn't check into them enough,,INFO
or maybe because everyone else was doing they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also,,INFO
so.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
It seems like there were on awful a lot of people making loans and business decisions on a,,INFO
get rich quick is the wrong phrase,,INFO
"but, if it captures some of the, the feeling I have from the people making business decisions that if they failed it's sort of well no skin of my back",,INFO
"I'll move on to this other company,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
or,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I, I just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were, were making the decisions for.",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
.,,CAT
"And I don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move, you know, that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didn't, weren't stuck to where they were",,QUESTION
and things begin to collapse,,QUESTION
they just moved on.,,QUESTION
I'm not sure.,,CAT
"Or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base that they, that they didn't care any more,",,INFO
"I, just, I'm rather puzzled about the,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
whole thing,,INFO
"I know, well, I'm, uh, I know a little bit about it",,INFO
but I don't as much as I should know about it,,INFO
I'm a finance major here at Clarion.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"And, um, I do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with a, a hundred thousand dollars.",,INFO
So they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars,,INFO
"and I think that's kind of why they, they were making the riskier loans,",,INFO
"because they were like oh, well, we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it.",,INFO
"Well, they didn't, they didn't have a since of risk.",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
I don't think so.,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"And, uh, plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in, any, almost any type of loan",,INFO
"and like some banks, you know, they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I think the S and L -s were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"And I think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve, then I don't think this would have happened.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"Well do you think we, there's a final accounting, yet not, in the since of pennies an nickels,",,QUESTION
"but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or, or that, that they really do understand how much money it is,",,QUESTION
"for awhile it seemed like every time I opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of damage, uh,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"did, is your since that we now understand how bad it is, *",,INFO
.,,CAT
or is there more to be heard yet.,,QUESTION
"Um, I think that people just basically got tired of hearing it",,INFO
"and it wasn't making, it was wasn't as good news as it was.",,INFO
"I think it's still, you know, I adding up,",,INFO
and I think it will be for awhile.,,INFO
"So you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet,",,INFO
No.,,CAT
or whether .,,CAT
"I, I don't think they do.",,CAT
"I don't think how, I don't think how they could find that big, how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose, because there still are some S and Ls still open.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And it's, it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this.",,INFO
To be caught in the .,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
Do you think to possibly is that it will help with the regular banks?,,QUESTION
"I, I don't know.",,CAT
"I thin-, I think it would be harder",,INFO
but I think there are some regular banks that will go down with it.,,INFO
"It seems that I recall reading for the last oh, let's say starting three years a go but not so much in the last year of bank risks of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico, Venezuela.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, and Argentina based on oil loans",,INFO
"and then the price of oil had, had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky,",,INFO
and I guess I read articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans.,,INFO
"I have this vague since that, that could happen that, that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah, um,",,CAT
in some of my classes now I was just reading,,INFO
I think it was in Venezuela,,INFO
"I can't remember what company it was,",,INFO
but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, and they just, they just wrote it right off.",,INFO
"I think, I think we've lost a lot of money",,INFO
"and, you know, like we every never going to get it back",,INFO
it's impossible to get it back.,,INFO
And so you think that it's just gone.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"uh-huh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"cause we-, we're, you know, we're talking about some peens that have just like even gave up on like getting it back and trying any more.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
They just totally wrote it off their book.,,INFO
Do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program,,QUESTION
like my since is it was there to try to protect small investors,,INFO
but it ended up protecting big investors.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"Which I don't think what it was meant to do,",,INFO
"so I guess I, I feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exist for these sorts of problems.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"um, yeah,",,CAT
"I think is it necessary to have, um, the backing, um,",,INFO
"it, it's, it's just for, you know, safe purposes, you know, in case something would happen. Um,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"I don't, I ne-,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
as long as there's enough little companies we're going to have to have something.,,INFO
"Um, so your since is that the, that, uh, the loan guaranties which really were accounts guaranties,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"so the, so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And given that the S and Ls have had disasters then those account holders are, are, their money is still being protected.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands I guess of,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Of dollars being protected.,,INFO
"It, it seems like, um, there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts, uh,",,INFO
"it's,",,CAT
"if, if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred bi-, billion dollars",,INFO
and we're taking about monies way in access of that now,,INFO
so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And perhaps multiple people in multiple S and Ls,,INFO
"and, and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about, rethought.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know that the, for,",,CAT
"I guess I'm content with the need to have protection on, on accounts",,INFO
but I feel likes it's on an individual basis.,,INFO
Someone whose got accounts in thirty-five different S and Ls or thirty or forty thousand dollars,,CAT
and they're all protected by the government.,,INFO
Seems to me like they've gotten around what was,,INFO
.,,CAT
intended to be the issue there.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"I guess I don't have a personal since of V on it since I,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
was not a heavy user of any S and Ls,,INFO
"and, and let alone any of them that went bankrupt.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"And I guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again,",,INFO
"I think it could happen,",,CAT
"because that means,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"I'm not worried enough, uh,",,INFO
it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive,,INFO
"and then I, then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things.",,INFO
I think it'll happen again,,CAT
but I think it will be a long time in the future before it does happen again.,,INFO
Because I think like the bank people in any kind of people like that are going to be worry enough not to let it happen again in the near future.,,INFO
But I think later on they're going to start and forget about and start making the riskier loans,,INFO
"because I mean, you're going to have to take some risk",,INFO
"and as long as their backed I think they're still going, you know, start taking on riskier loans,",,INFO
"and I think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until, you know, late, you know, in the future.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well, perhaps if there are regulatory, uh, constraints put back in place.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
It will protect that,,INFO
"maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation, uh.",,INFO
,,
"Well, tell me about your home.",,COMMAND
Okay.,,CAT
"Uh, right now we're living in,",,INFO
"well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys.",,INFO
"And, uh, right now we're in a, uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Which you might call it.,,INFO
"So we don't have a, a big yard. Uh,",,INFO
"but, uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us.",,INFO
So it was enough.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half.",,INFO
Because it's not a full two story.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom.",,INFO
"So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house",,INFO
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, it's about a five year old house now.",,INFO
It sounds nice.,,G_G
"It's, uh, pretty nice.",,CAT
"Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already",,INFO
"Oh, yeah?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"It was a,",,CAT
Landmark is the one who built it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, you know, these guys that gambled high",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
lost big you know.,,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
"And, uh",,INFO
Exactly what happened to them.,,CAT
I'm insulating myself from that problem.,,INFO
I'm building my own house.,,INFO
"Oh, that's nice.",,G_G
"And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today",,INFO
"Oh, really.",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
Are you doing it yourself?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
Wow.,,G_G
I used to be a builder.,,INFO
"Oh, that's nice.",,G_G
And I retired about five years ago and,,INFO
"Oh, I see.",,CAT
started college.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
And now I'm a college educated builder,,INFO
"There's still no work, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, uh, you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials",,INFO
so I did.,,INFO
That's great.,,G_G
"And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.",,INFO
"R-,",,CAT
is that so?,,QUESTION
I didn't know that.,,INFO
You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house,,INFO
but you can't borrow the money to build your own.,,INFO
Well that sounds kind of dumb.,,G_G
"Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and then it doesn't sell,,INFO
and then the bank's,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
holding the bag.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Well.,,CAT
Huh.,,CAT
"As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?",,INFO
That's right,,CAT
Hence the savings and loan problem we have.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple.",,INFO
It's designed to be added on to.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That's good.,,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I figure it's just me and my wife",,INFO
"but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,",,INFO
so I want,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
to have a shop.,,INFO
How big a lot do you got it on?,,QUESTION
Ten acres.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
That's nice.,,G_G
That's real nice.,,G_G
"Well, yeah.",,CAT
It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor.,,INFO
He's on the other side of a hill.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.,,INFO
.,,CAT
Seriously.,,INFO
God.,,G_G
That's pretty good.,,G_G
"Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy",,INFO
"but, you know, he's",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I can just make out his place, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh,",,CAT
"Oh, that's pretty good.",,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.",,INFO
"Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?",,QUESTION
"Well, it's got a, a very small furnace.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, lo-, these many months",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I have not had to use the heat.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
Because it's all geothermal.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
That's pretty good.,,G_G
"And with all the,",,CAT
"see I've got,",,CAT
on the south side is all glass.,,INFO
"Well, as much as I could get in it, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, the east side is glass.",,INFO
"I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet.",,INFO
So it's almost all glass.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"And, uh,",,CAT
My wife would love that,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"I mean, you know.",,INFO
She loves lots of windows.,,INFO
There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.,,INFO
That's great.,,G_G
"So, uh,",,CAT
Is it a single story?,,QUESTION
"Well, not really.",,CAT
"It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.",,INFO
"Oh, I see.",,CAT
"So the first, you know,",,CAT
"the, the, the,",,CAT
what I call residential level,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.,,INFO
"Um, I see.",,CAT
"And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
So I've got a pretty good grade there.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And then when I put the verandas whi-, which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
that will define the shop.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?",,QUESTION
Exactly.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I've always liked that.",,INFO
"The,",,CAT
"you know, I, we don't have much yard",,INFO
but I built a small deck in the back.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I, I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck.",,INFO
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"Do you, have you ever had to put your children in, child care, Mary Dell?",,QUESTION
Oh yes.,,CAT
I'm an old experienced hand.,,INFO
"I started back when it wasn't,",,INFO
.,,CAT
stylish to do that at all.,,INFO
.,,CAT
My daughter that's seventeen now,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I worked even when she was a baby.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
And I had private care for both my daughters until they were two,,INFO
"and then I was really lucky to have put them in a,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist, right off",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
of Walnut Hill and Preston.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And it was a wonderful environment.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"I, I just wish all kids, if they have to be put in day school, could have that kind of place",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I see.,,CAT
"So, it worked well.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
How about you?,,QUESTION
"Well, I have, uh, a nine year old and a six year old",,INFO
and neither one of them has ever been in,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"in, uh, day care for the reason of, of me working",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but, uh, they both went through preschool.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, we've just been real lucky",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I think, anyway. To not,",,INFO
It's not hard to find anything that's part-time.,,INFO
So many of the churches have really strong,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
like half day programs.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
preschool and children's day out,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but, it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little",,INFO
and this is one of the few churches that did it.,,INFO
There were a couple downtown Dallas,,INFO
"but they were so, seemed,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"cold and impersonal,",,INFO
I just couldn't hack it.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And what I liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there when Cheryl was two, which was fifteen years ago, many of them are still there today.",,INFO
So there,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
was real continuity.,,INFO
She went back as a teenager,,INFO
and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there.,,INFO
"Oh, my gosh.",,G_G
"So, it, it was really neat.",,INFO
But it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love,,INFO
and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
she just kept good people and,,INFO
Oh my goodness,,G_G
"real cheerful place, lots of arts and crafts,",,INFO
and I'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
That if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that is, uh, a big drawback I think in that, in the, uh, public schools out here.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, to,",,INFO
you're lucky to have an art teacher,,INFO
"and if you do you get them once a week or something, you know.",,INFO
Or pay for it after school.,,INFO
Our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman,,INFO
and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art,,INFO
and,,INFO
Oh is that right?,,QUESTION
I had no idea.,,INFO
"you know, I willingly did it",,INFO
"but I thought,",,INFO
.,,CAT
this makes me angry.,,INFO
This is something that ought to be in the schools,,INFO
Oh my goodness.,,G_G
rather than some of the other stuff they do.,,INFO
"And with our budget cuts, I'm sure",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
that's not going to not going to change anytime soon.,,INFO
"Well that's the only way they're. Yeah, well, that's the only way they're going to be able to do it.",,INFO
And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that.,,INFO
Oh my goodness.,,G_G
"So, in some ways I think the, the day schools do serve those purposes.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
That's true.,,CAT
"Well even the preschools, you know they get so much of that in preschool",,INFO
"and then when they hit kindergarten, you know, it's like wham",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Culture shock.,,INFO
"It's just,",,CAT
Put the colors away,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
Get the computers out,,COMMAND
Which is too bad.,,INFO
"and, you know.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That's hard.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
It's so difficult for them.,,INFO
"Um, did you have your children, did you say in home, in, in, private care,",,QUESTION
was that in your home or in someone else's home?,,QUESTION
Until they were two.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
both times they were at our house.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So you were able to have somebody come there.,,QUESTION
And that was hard too.,,INFO
"I, I lucked out with really good people both times",,INFO
but I know so many people that are never able to find that,,INFO
"and I'd practically give my paycheck away to do it,",,INFO
so,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Did you have a nanny,,QUESTION
or did you have someone,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
that lived in with you?,,INFO
"Well no,",,CAT
she didn't live with us.,,INFO
"Uh, the first one was an,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"elderly lady who was putting a, a daughter through nursing school",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
just purely on baby-sitting money.,,INFO
Oh my goodness.,,G_G
And she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
because both our parents are dead.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"So that, that was a plus from",,INFO
Oh gosh.,,G_G
that respect as well.,,INFO
And then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
that kept her.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"I have, uh,",,INFO
I just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I was just listening to a program this morning,",,INFO
"oh well, I guess it was on the HOME SHOW,",,INFO
"but they were talking about, uh, a new, uh,",,INFO
oh I can't even think of the name of it.,,INFO
I was halfway listening while I was painting,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they've now moved it to Washington, D C",,INFO
"and the, the doctor that was on there, the pediatrician said, you know, I can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and leaving them there.,,INFO
Oh that would be hard.,,INFO
"You know, so, um,",,CAT
"Well, they give a lot more leave.",,INFO
"I work at N C N B now,",,INFO
"and our benefits for maternal and, and parental care and even for elderly people",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"are, are really expanding.",,INFO
"We have more options now then we did when I, my kids were born,",,INFO
with being able to take off full-time longer,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"of, you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time for",,INFO
"Oh boy, that's great.",,G_G
up to six months.,,INFO
It's really neat.,,INFO
"I've, I've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week",,INFO
"or they've, you know, whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
We try to work it with their hours.,,INFO
And that helps because you don't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"okay, I never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
And the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals.,,INFO
"I've,",,CAT
of course it's too late for me so,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"I've, I've not tried them to see how effective they are",,INFO
but,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast,,INFO
"God, it's amazing",,G_G
"And for our age group it's too late, too little, too late.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"But I, I do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Two income families I think are here to stay.,,INFO
"Well and I would think, you know, since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, the, the people that work in big business have families",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
they have children.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and",,INFO
Oh sure.,,CAT
working,,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
You retain employees and keep them longer.,,INFO
"That's, that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Employee Assistance Programs that,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
split ourselves in fifteen million pieces,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"So, I, I hope it helps.",,INFO
It seems to help the new mothers,,INFO
Oh that's good.,,G_G
not have to come back full-time.,,INFO
because that's hard.,,INFO
That's good to know.,,G_G
"I have a couple of friends that,",,INFO

four to six children in the home,,INFO
"and my future, future sister-in-law's mother does that too, full-time.",,INFO
"Well in Plano though the problem is, you find,",,INFO
and this is what I found with Emily.,,INFO
"I, from the time she started first grade, I wanted her out in Plano area.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I kept finding neighbors and friends,,INFO
and they'd move.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
She ended up being in a different home every year.,,INFO
Too transit.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I finally decided I didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move.,,INFO
And her surroundings.,,INFO

"Uh, I don't know how hail is formed",,CAT
"I think, I think",,INFO
to tell you the truth.,,INFO
"that's,",,INFO

"It's not on the ground,",,INFO
but,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
must be.,,INFO
in the clouds it is.,,INFO
"I guess,",,INFO

"all honesty, you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years.",,INFO
We haven't had a,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"really bad one,",,INFO
I missed that one of eighty or eighty-two or eighty-one,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
that had the heat wave.,,INFO
"It may be eighty-two, because we bought our house in eighty-one",,INFO
"and we built a pool in eighty-two,",,INFO
,,
"Uh, no",,CAT
"I think that maybe the, the automation people that are",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"very discrete. Or not discrete, electronic devices.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"So, and, did he, i-, is he the one that got you connected with us?",,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
It's a lot of fun.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You want to punch the button and go?,,INFO
"Sure,",,CAT
you ready?,,QUESTION
Yip,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
"Well, are you going to buy a car soon?",,QUESTION
"Well, it won't be too much longer because my husband and I are both going to re-, retire.",,INFO
"And when we retire we're going to buy us, a, you know, a new one and, and get rid of the two that we have right now.",,INFO
And what are you going to buy?,,QUESTION
"I do-, I don't know,",,INFO
"we're either going to buy a pick up,",,INFO
or we're going to buy a van.,,INFO
"Or we're going to buy an economy car,",,INFO
how do you like that ?,,QUESTION
"Well, have you been listening to Iacocca's arguments that, uh, that Chrysler products are the only ones that, that all have air bags?",,QUESTION
"Uh, yeah.",,CAT
Does that make a difference to you?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
It sure does.,,INFO
"I really would like to have something like that,",,INFO
"and I'm hoping that by you know,",,INFO
"that's like, right now,",,CAT
my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now.,,INFO
"But I keep saying lets put it off, lets put it off, because I'm hoping they'll get so many better features.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
like what?,,QUESTION
"Well, just like that air bag.",,INFO
I think that thing is fantastic.,,INFO
"Because I've seen some of the, you know, like the head on collision type things,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
when they had it and people walk away from it.,,INFO
"We had one here,",,INFO
"I guess it was about three weeks ago,",,INFO
"and the people walked away from the, wreck,",,INFO
That's .,,CAT
"with no scratches nothing. You know, a few bruises.",,INFO
"Di-, did you see the, uh,",,QUESTION
"I don't know if it was TWENTY-TWENTY, last Thursday or Friday night on, on seat belts?",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Did that scare you a little bit?,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
With the lady being thrown out,,INFO
You got it.,,G_G
"I,",,CAT
and run over.,,INFO
"I, tell you what,",,INFO
"I would not, I would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door.",,INFO
"that really sc-,",,CAT
"I, I guess, I,",,CAT
"that, that a little more than scared me,",,INFO
"that irritated me, uh,",,INFO
"that,",,CAT
"because it, it, it surely didn't come as a surprise that, that if the door came open the lady would fall out,",,INFO
"I mean, and,",,CAT
"Well, you know what the average person,",,INFO
would you ever have thought of that?,,QUESTION
uh,,CAT
"I mean now i-,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
"probably, well,",,CAT
"you probably wouldn't have,",,INFO
"I might,",,CAT
"the problem is I'm really into cars,",,INFO
"and so it's not a, uh,",,CAT
"for me it's, it's a real, it's a real consideration, uh, uh,",,INFO
"and, and, uh, the,",,CAT
but no,,CAT
I probably wouldn't have even though I'm really quite into cars,,INFO
"it's,",,INFO
Right,,CAT
it's probably my main hobby.,,INFO
"because you always think,",,INFO
"I mean, I don't know,",,CAT
"maybe you don't,",,INFO
"but just like me, I always think well, you know, these things must be safe,",,INFO
"but that's just like,",,CAT
"I don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago, they said, you know, before they had the, like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"All these people were,",,INFO
"and, and it, it was on one of those kind of shows like TWENTY-TWENTY",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"these people were like paralyzed,",,INFO
"and because, it threw them forward,",,INFO
"but they were hooked at the waist,",,INFO
"and so it like, you know, did something to their spinal cord",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
then they were like paraplegics.,,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"you know, ROAD AND TRACK had a, had some articles on,",,INFO
"and particularly with, with back seat, uh, with some, where kids, were, were sitting in the back seat with seat belts on,",,INFO
"and they were thrown forward, into the front seat,",,INFO
"and there was enough stretching, the combination of stretching the spine to, uh, par-, I mean, the serious injury, even though they were, they were still locked in the",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"they were forced to go,",,INFO
"so really if your sitting in the back seat, your better off not not to have your seat belt on, if it's just a seat belt.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"We have a van, that, uh, just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness",,INFO
"Well, tell me about your van.",,COMMAND
Do you like it?,,QUESTION
"I have an Arrow Star van,",,CAT
we really do.,,CAT
"Uh, it's, it's a mini van,",,INFO
"we've had it,",,INFO
goodness in May will be five years,,INFO
"and, uh, they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty.",,INFO
And the transmission was replaced,,INFO
"but they really are nifty, uh,",,INFO
"the mini van, it's",,CAT
"actually, we had a station wagon before,",,INFO
"and it's a foot or two shorter than a,",,INFO
we had a regular size station wagon,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it really, uh,",,CAT
"we like it,",,INFO
"it, the",,CAT
interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks.,,INFO
"Huh. The reason that we're thinking about something like that, we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to Florida",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, like I said, I mean, we're not that old",,INFO
"but my husband works for the State,",,INFO
and after a certain amount of years you can retire.,,INFO
And when he retires I'm retiring.,,INFO
"Well, as soon as I get my quarters in, I'm,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"retiring period,",,INFO
"that's it,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, no more",,INFO
"Well, but, the,",,CAT
"did you,",,QUESTION
As though,,CAT
did you go to Florida in a van?,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"And we wanted to travel,",,INFO
"well, that was really nice traveling",,INFO
"but you know, I like to know more, I mean, hear about more people that have things like that you know?",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And see what they think of them,",,INFO
the different kinds,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"because I've only ridden in the one,",,INFO
"What, what kind was it?",,QUESTION
that's it.,,CAT
"Uh, shoot",,CAT
I can't even think of the name of it now.,,INFO
"What, what was remarkable, this van, even with, the,",,INFO
"we have two kids,",,INFO
and we went to Disney World,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, actually I grew up in Alabama,",,INFO
"and I went to see my mother,",,INFO
"and then went on down to Disney World,",,INFO
"and it got better than, I think twenty-two, twenty-three miles a gallon.",,INFO
"And this was with the air conditioner on and, and you know",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"four people with, with luggage,",,INFO
"and, uh, course this,",,CAT
"grant it,",,CAT
"that's, you know, it's been four years ago,",,INFO
"but it's remarkable that the, that the bigger vans, uh, they're, uh,",,INFO
"my boss just bought a, a pick up truck,",,INFO
"and, uh, he only gets seventeen miles a gallon.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But it, it has a big engine,",,INFO
"and it, it, pulls a boat and stuff,",,INFO
"but it's, and it, it's got the seats",,INFO
"that, and the other thing that is interesting, is it has, uh, rear air conditioning.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And that, that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, now, this one that we went in,",,INFO
it did,,CAT
baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in?,,CAT
Ford.,,CAT
A what?,,CAT
Ford.,,CAT
A Ford?,,CAT
"Ford what,",,CAT
you remember?,,CAT
"He was trying to think of what the name of it was,",,INFO
"Well, the big, you know, the big vans are all,",,INFO
this was a big one.,,INFO
"I mean it was a big one,",,INFO
"real nice,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
oh those are,,CAT
"it has the front and the back and you know, it has the",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"uh, back seat let down into a double, I mean a queen size bed",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and then it had the two swivels in the middle, and then the two swivel chairs on the front",,INFO
All right.,,CAT
"and, I mean it was fantastic,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it got good gas mileage,",,INFO
but I don't know,,CAT
"I don't really, I don't,",,CAT
"I want something I can drive too, you know,",,INFO
Well,,CAT
and I was scared to drive that big van.,,INFO
"well, the mini, that,",,INFO
"you'd be surprised if, if you drive a, one of the, the mini vans, uh,",,INFO
"more or less alike the, the, uh, Chevrolet",,INFO
"and, uh, well of course, Oldsmobile has got one,",,INFO
"and Chryslers got one,",,INFO
but they drive remarkably like cars.,,INFO
"Well, do you, does yours have that this one had it where you know, you would see something coming in the rear view mirror, I mean not the rear, those little side mirror things",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and it would look like it was further back than it was.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"but, the little, thing etched in it,",,INFO
"say objects are, are closer than they appear or something",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
does yours do that too?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh. I was wondering if all vans did that,",,QUESTION
"Well you, you can, you can, uh, install those mirrors,",,INFO
"we've got the big side mirrors, which are really nice.",,INFO
"I don't know if you've, well, if you've driven a pick up truck, you know,",,INFO
"these are, these, uh, mirrors must be six inches across not nearly a foot high,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they're really nice, uh,",,INFO
"got them on both sides,",,INFO
"actually they, they fold, so when you get in tight situations, you can fold them back.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
But they're,,CAT
"well, see that's the reason we couldn't make, really make them,",,INFO
"at first we were going to get a pick up truck, with a camper on the back of it,",,INFO
uh-huh.,,CAT
"of it,",,INFO
"but then that gas mileage was just atrocious,",,INFO
"I mean it's,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"unreal,",,INFO
"it's, it just practically don't get any.",,INFO
"Well, they have got, some of the newer ones they, you know, with the aerodynamic features,",,INFO
"you can get pretty, pretty decent gas mileage.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And then, uh, he talked about a van,",,INFO
"and I said, well, you know, I don't know, I don't know how the gas is on most of these.",,INFO
And another thing was,,INFO
"that's the reason I said you know, there was such a big difference you know, in a little economy car,",,INFO
but I said,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
when we went somewhere.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
But really and truly the safety features,,INFO
"but I wouldn't get one that,",,INFO
"if it had, the seat belts on the door now",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I wouldn't get it.,,INFO
Period.,,INFO
"Ford now announced I think in ninety-two, they're going to put, uh, air bags in their, in their vans.",,INFO
Oh that would be good.,,INFO
"So, uh, and I think, I, I believe safety,",,INFO
"I, I, I, I really do believe in this stuff, uh,",,INFO
"and I, I think it can go, ,",,INFO
"I'm not,",,CAT
the air bags are a good deal,,INFO
"but, uh, surprisingly, uh, they're, uh,",,CAT
"you really need to do,",,INFO
"you need a combination of both the air bags and the, uh,",,INFO
"Oh I think so too,",,CAT
and the seat belts,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
I don't think they should do away with the seat belts now.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I'm,,CAT
but I think you need the shoulder thing,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think you need the thing around your waist,",,INFO
"but, I think you need that bag to pop out too.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, because I know so many people, here that have been killed in head on collisions, where maybe if they had, had that, that",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"air bag, they may still be walking around.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, I think it's fantastic.",,INFO
I wish they required it in everything.,,INFO
"Every new car that came out, I wish they would require it in it.",,INFO
"It would be that would do to our insurance rates, you know, if, if, uh, if the insurance companies says it, says we're not going to pay, you know, a claim, if, if the car doesn't have, uh, air bags.",,INFO
Would be interesting wouldn't it?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, that wouldn't be fair",,INFO
"but, uh,",,CAT
"Well, no because what they would do is, that's what they're going to plan on, you know,",,INFO
"they would have to do it,",,INFO
the insurance company would have to do the same thing.,,INFO
"They're given like, a ten year time limit",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"where,",,INFO
okay.,,CAT
"These cars, I guess they figure all the old cars, will be off the roads or something by the, in ten years",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and then, you know, if you didn't have a car that had one, then your insurance would go up enormously,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"uh-huh,",,CAT
"uh, I've got to go",,INFO
"my son's in a performance tonight,",,INFO
"I have to leave,",,INFO
"Oh that's okay,",,CAT
in a couple of minutes.,,INFO
"Uh, I think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"It was good talking to you,",,G_G
"Well, you, you too.",,G_G
Okay.,,G_G
Good night.,,G_G
All right,,G_G
bye bye.,,G_G
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"did you vote in the last, uh, national election?",,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
"we, uh, uh, I haven't missed a one since I've been eligible to vote.",,INFO
"Oh, that's good.",,G_G
Did you get to vote at the last one?,,QUESTION
I voted in the last national one.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
I'm not sure *,,INFO
if I got the last local one.,,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"and sometimes the, the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that, uh, they should be.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
you're not sure where to go and vote and all that.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"and, uh, there's usually nobody running against, you know, the incumbents.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"or you don't know what they st-, you know, where they stand or anything like that.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So, uh, but I, I feel that, uh, a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think you're right.,,INFO
"And, it's, it's, they're,",,CAT
"and also they're fed up with the system,",,INFO
"and they say, well, why should I even vote.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
or sometimes they don't like either of the choices,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"for the candidates,",,INFO
"so they think, well, you know, why vote.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
The lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"really,",,CAT
especially in Texas,,INFO
"Oh, I know it",,CAT
.,,CAT
"The last gubernatorial race was, oh it was awful.",,INFO
"It really was,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"So I don't know,",,CAT
"I, I,",,CAT
"it'll be interesting to see how the next, uh, few years go.",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
Did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote.,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think, well, it's, it's definitely a problem,",,INFO
and I think it could get worse.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, we get this lackadaisical attitude,",,INFO
"and say, huh, you know, why should we vote,",,INFO
"then, you know, it could, uh, it could lead to some serious things.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It also seems like maybe a-, another candidate that nobody wants could slip in",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"if, you know, not enough people are voting.",,INFO
"Right, uh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"we can get, uh, yeah, if we get someone in there like that, then, you know, they could make all sorts of changes that they were, you know, had enough pull.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it's kind of like in Louisiana where that, uh, guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
member something got elected.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Kind of scary when you think about that.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and, uh, who's the other guy, LaRouche that, uh, is sort of the, uh, socialist, not socialist but comm-,",,INFO
"he's so off the wall that, uh, he's gone in and tried to get into city elections",,INFO
"and, uh, but he's got, he's been put away for, uh, credit card fraud, I believe.",,INFO
"Oh, gosh.",,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
"Lyndon LaRouche, that's it.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"people will sit home and assume, oh, that guy would never get elected.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Next thing you know, you've got him.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"If you don't go and vote, then, you know, very good chance that they, they will",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"because a lot of the people like that, they'll strike a chord in something, you know, in some of the people, that so will say, look, you know, this guy's got everything together.",,INFO
"You know, I like what he says,",,INFO
and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him.,,INFO
"Right, yeah.",,CAT
"And, uh, I think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"because, because, um, the guy did get elected, correct?",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
That's what I thought.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
he sure did.,,INFO
"And, uh, , but you know, they can always fool us, you know.",,INFO
He might do a good job.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days, or you could mail it in, or something like, if you have, if you have real strict work hours, and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
I think that discourages a lot of people.,,INFO
"What we do, usually, is, uh, vote, uh, absenteeism",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"and, uh, I know, here, you know, you don't have to have any reason,",,INFO
you can just go and vote,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and the polls are open, what was it, a couple of weeks,",,INFO
the hours are good,,INFO
and they're even open on Saturdays,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and a couple of Sundays.,,INFO
"And so we've got plenty of time to go, because down here in Houston, it's, uh, the lines are long.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I'm in Dallas,",,INFO
and they're long here too.,,INFO
"So, uh, but, uh,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
I voted absentee one year.,,INFO
I really was going to be gone.,,INFO
"So, I did it,",,INFO
"but, uh, it was nice.",,INFO
I would be tempted to do it again.,,INFO
"Well, uh, I recommend it, because you just walk right on in, and there's usually not anybody in line",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and, uh, you know, that vote's just as good as, you know, the one on election day.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I think they should change the whole system so that it's easier,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
I think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle.,,INFO
"Um, yeah,",,CAT
"I've been involved with, uh, some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the, of the Republican party.",,INFO
"And it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the, uh, how the, uh, the not the ballots,",,INFO
"but, uh, my mind has gone blank.",,INFO
I've been all evening,,INFO
.,,CAT
"How they develop, uh, what the candidate stands for",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"you know, the views, and, uh, you know, everybody gets to vote on, you know, well, should he be for this and on and on and on,",,INFO
"and, uh, it's, it's interesting.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that would be.,,INFO
I usually vote.,,INFO
"A lot of times I'll vote a straight party ticket just because I don't take the time to find out what every, you know, other than the major candidates, what they stand for",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"on what issues,",,INFO
"so I'll just trust well, the party kind of goes along these lines so I'll go ahead and vote.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"There for a while, that would, that worked.",,INFO
"We've, uh, I know I have, um,",,CAT
"I'll stick to uh, to the, you know, sometimes I'll stick to a certain party, depends on the guy.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, uh, if it, uh, gets down between two, then I'll, I'll vote for the party",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"because I know, you know, something about the other guy",,INFO
"or, you know, they're both just as bad,",,INFO
"and I'll say, Well, I know what this guy stands for as far as for his party,",,INFO
"and, um, but",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"You know, that's not the best way",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
I guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything.,,INFO
"But it gets to the point where,",,INFO
"I mean, you've got to have the ti-, find the time also to read about the guy and, and be able to find the information about what he stands for.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
and try to determine if what you read was objective or not.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"or what you've heard on T V, which I think is just outrageous.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I don't agree with how the media handles elections.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, you know, I'm tired of hearing about the polls, you know, you know,",,INFO
this is how he stands such and such a day,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"the way they break it out,",,INFO
"it's just, it's just ridiculous.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think it could affect the outcome, you know, could make it unfair.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"it really could,",,INFO
"and, uh, then, how, sometimes, how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead,",,INFO
"and they keep dragging it on,",,INFO
and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"so, uh,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
the press has a lot of power.,,INFO
They really do.,,CAT
"I, I sometimes think that that should be limited more.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"oh, but, boy you try get into that,",,INFO
you'd really open a can of worms.,,INFO
"Oh, yes,",,CAT
"or they, I agree with the freedom of the press, you know, and all the amendments,",,INFO
but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"seems that they should regulate themselves a little bit,",,INFO
and I don't think they ever care to.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
they don't.,,INFO
"Well, I can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting, to talk about.",,G_G
"Well, I enjoyed talking to you.",,G_G
"Well, it was good talking to you.",,G_G
All right.,,G_G
Bye.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G

"Well, do you, you know, do you do gardening at home?",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"we go home,",,INFO
"well, we have a large family,",,INFO
there's twelve kids in my family.,,INFO
Oh my goodness.,,G_G
"So, like almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden.",,INFO
Hm.,,CAT
So we have a pretty good size garden,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
well I guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest,,INFO
.,,CAT
"But we have like a lot,",,INFO
"like my mom likes flowers, so we have a lot of flowers too.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I had a whole bunch of flowers and things.,,INFO
"Well, I don't have as many now.",,INFO
We lived in the country,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"for a long time,",,INFO
and I had a whole bunch.,,INFO
"But now, I work and I live in the city so, that sort a kind of hung it up.",,INFO
"I have a few flowers, but most of mine are like in barrels and things like that.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And this year I decided that,",,INFO
"well my husband made a little garden out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it,",,INFO
"but I decided that I don't like grass,",,INFO
I don't like to have to have to pull grass,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
so I decided that I would plant me a tomato plant in a flower pot,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and see how it worked.,,INFO
And mine looks real good,,G_G
"You know, I've seen a lot of people that do that.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I've seen, you know, like elderly people",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
that really can't get out too much sometimes.,,INFO
"Like we,",,CAT
"I have a great aunt that lives in a,",,INFO
"it's just like, uh, a high rise for elderly people.",,INFO
"And, you know, she does her own thing and everything,",,INFO
"but she has,",,INFO
it's like a little apartment building.,,INFO
And she has a tomato plant year round.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"Because she, you know,",,INFO
"they keep it warm with, for all the older people,",,INFO
and she keeps it year round.,,INFO
I had never thought about that.,,INFO
"I could probably plant one and bring it in, and just like I bring my plants in every year.",,INFO
That'd be neat.,,INFO
"Well, I got a patio,",,INFO
and I tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots,,INFO
.,,CAT
"And planting them all in it, you know, because that's favorite thing, is tomatoes",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
to grow.,,INFO
"And so, um, but he said, No,",,INFO
"he was going to plant in the earth, you know, like he always has,",,INFO
because he's always had a garden out in the country.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I think he kind of misses it a little bit, you know, since we moved to the city.",,INFO
"But, um, I went ahead and planted one, and mine looks better than his",,INFO
.,,CAT
"It does,",,INFO
"and then I like, um,",,CAT
you know what day lilies are?,,QUESTION
Pardon me?,,CAT
Day lilies.,,INFO
"Are they, well,",,QUESTION
do they just come out in the morning then go,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but we call them Morning Glories up here.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
no.,,CAT
Huh-uh.,,CAT
These look like a lily.,,INFO
"They look like a, a, well, they really look like an orchid when they come out.",,INFO
Oh really.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"That what the look like,",,INFO
but they only bloom for one day.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"They'll, um,",,INFO
"you'll have a bud the evening before,",,INFO
"and then the next morning as soon as the sun hits it, it open-, it starts opening up",,INFO
"and then when it gets dark, it closes",,INFO
and that's it.,,INFO
It only blooms for one day.,,INFO
"And then it's done, completely done.",,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, um, they look like orchids, is what they look like,",,INFO
"but they look like different color ones,",,INFO
"like I have, uh, yellow ones,",,INFO
"and I have red ones,",,INFO
and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I have purple ones,,INFO
"and then they have like, you know, the real velvety looking stuff inside",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
it looks just like orchids in different colors.,,INFO
That's what they look like.,,INFO
"Oh, really pretty.",,G_G
"They are, they're beautiful.",,INFO
"Uh, I have a friend when I lived out in the country,",,INFO
"and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year, you know, or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I mean they were real expensive.,,INFO
"They were like, well,",,INFO
the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty-two fifty for one bulb.,,INFO
"Oh, my gosh.",,G_G
"So what she would do is she would plant them, and they multiplied.",,INFO
"So the next year when she, you know, weeded them out",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"so they wouldn't be as thick, then she'd give me some of the bulbs.",,INFO
"And, I mean, I have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen.",,INFO
"So, when we decided to move, it was really funny because, like I said, I had a whole bunch of different kinds of things,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and I kept saying, Well, I want to take a few of these, and I want to take these, and I want to take these.",,INFO
"My husband finally said, Look, are we going to take the grass?",,INFO
.,,CAT
Can we leave the grass?,,INFO
"I said, Yes, we may leave that.",,INFO
"take the whole grass, the whole yard.",,INFO
"And we had a tree that was like seventeen foot tall, or something like that, that he said, No, no, I am not taking the tree.",,INFO
"You know, I mean, every time we went outside, he'd look at something that was humongous, you know,",,INFO
"No,",,INFO
we're not taking that.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"But the last day, he said, Can't we leave the grass,",,INFO
"and I said, Yeah,",,INFO
I think we will leave that.,,INFO
That'd be funny.,,G_G
"But, I brought,",,INFO
"my kids, when they were little they had given me some azaleas",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
so I brought all my azalea bushes.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And you know, I brought, I brought as much as I could bring",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"without, you know, really tearing up their place.",,INFO
"But, just like, um, you know,",,INFO
"the people that bought ours, bought the place, but, um, I knew that they would, you know,",,INFO
"if I left like one bulb of each one of them, by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something, you know,",,INFO
it would cover it right up.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, I just couldn't see it, you know, going off and leaving everything like that.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Because this house, I really liked it and everything, but the yard was a lot to be desired.",,INFO
Oh,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
there was nothing.,,INFO
"These people,",,INFO
we have one ugly pine tree.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"I mean, and it is ugly.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"I even tried making it look nicer, you know,",,INFO
"I tied the yellow ribbon around it,",,INFO
and it was so ugly.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"Oh, it did not help, let me tell you.",,INFO
I took it off and put it on my door.,,INFO
I did not want to call attention.,,INFO
"I mean, it was terrible.",,INFO
So really the plants that I brought over and put out here are just about all.,,INFO
"I don't do any of the mowing or, you know, edging and all that",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
My husband does all that stuff.,,INFO
But that's because I'm allergic to the grass.,,INFO
"Oh, that'd be awful.",,G_G
I love going out in the Summer in the grass.,,INFO
Really.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Now I like to go to the beach where the sand is,",,INFO
because then it doesn't make me ill,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, um, well even up here at school, you know, it gets hot, and we have the windows open,",,INFO
well they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning.,,INFO
"And just to smell the grass, it's just,",,INFO
I just love the smell of freshly cut grass.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I used to until it, I got so allergic to it.",,INFO
"I don't know if it's all, well,",,INFO
I went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds I was allergic to.,,INFO
"But it's not as bad here,",,INFO
"like Saint Augustine, I think, is what we have.",,INFO
And it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But out in the country, I mean,",,INFO
"if I went outside while he was mowing the grass, I was going to have a gigantic attack.",,INFO
Oh my gosh.,,G_G
"So, um, I get shots for it now, too.",,INFO
That helps a whole bunch.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, one good thing about it, see I don't have to mow the grass",,INFO
or,,CAT
.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"I mean, that's really nice.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
you said that you had a garden.,,INFO
"What all things do you plant in it,",,QUESTION
or do you like to plant in it?,,QUESTION
"Well, the first thing we always plant is tomatoes",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
every year.,,INFO
"I don't care if we don't have anything else,",,INFO
we're going to have tomatoes.,,INFO
And then we plant cucumbers,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
do your cucumbers come good?,,QUESTION
Oh yeah.,,CAT
Really.,,CAT
"Sometimes when my dad has, like,",,INFO
that's the one thing no one is allowed to touch except my dad.,,INFO
"He takes care of all the cucumbers,",,INFO
"because he said the vines are just so,",,INFO
"at our house, as soon as you touch a vine, it's like it completely dies.",,INFO
"Really,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"It must be the, uh,",,INFO
"Sometimes we have really good luck with them,",,INFO
but then there'll be like maybe two years in a row that we can't get anything.,,INFO
"Now that's, I mean, that's something that grows like a weed here.",,INFO
"Oh, wow.",,G_G
"I mean, it grows like a weed.",,INFO
"We have to allow extra room for those, because, you know, I mean extra space,",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
because they take up a lot.,,INFO
between the rows and all.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"but I mean, we usually get,",,INFO
"if we plant, for every one plant we probably get fifty to sixty cucumbers off of it.",,INFO
Holy smoke.,,G_G
"I mean, just pulling them as fast as you can.",,INFO
We usually give them to everybody.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Anybody that wants a cucumber can have it.,,INFO
"But we tried it, too, where you run it up a fence",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, um, we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence.",,INFO
I mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other.,,INFO
Oh my gosh.,,G_G
"I mean, it was,",,INFO
"but they're so heavy, you know,",,INFO
they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down.,,INFO
"But, I mean, cucumbers here grow like crazy.",,INFO
Wow.,,CAT
Of course it's real hot here too.,,INFO
"Well, see, tomatoes grow like crazy at our house.",,INFO
"Like we have a section of tomatoes,",,INFO
"and we put the tomatoes there every year, in the same section.",,INFO
And I swear we get tomatoes six rows up.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"now if we have any, like the birds will pick or something, you know,",,INFO
and some of the seeds drop.,,INFO
Have you ever had them just come up in different places?,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I know, we do that, too, you know,",,INFO
"and at the first year,",,INFO
"because I was from the city when we got married,",,INFO
"and the first year that we planted, I couldn't figure out, I mean, the,",,INFO
"well, the first year after",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean, we planted them,",,INFO
"but the first year, you know, after we'd had a crop",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"all these little things like,",,INFO
"we had cucumbers coming up, you know, in the middle of our okra,",,INFO
"and I thought, how did this get here",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I know I didn't put that seed there.,,INFO
"And it was weird, but the birds had, you know, evidently just deposited them for us.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well, sometimes, too, when we take out our garbage,",,INFO
"and we usually, you know, we just dump it in the middle of the garden, you know, after your garden's basically done",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and we're finding out,",,INFO
"like we have peach trees in the middle of our garden now, because we took peach seeds and dump them there, whenever the garden,",,INFO
"like in the Fall,",,INFO
"now we have peach trees coming up,",,INFO
,,
Okay.,,CAT
Yes.,,CAT
"Uh, well, right now we have one dog inside.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
She goes out,,INFO
but I mean she's an indoor dog.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
And two outside cats.,,INFO
"Oh, gosh.",,G_G
Male and female.,,INFO
And how long have you had them?,,QUESTION
"The ma-,",,CAT
"the dog is probably about, about thirteen, fourteen years old.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"And the cats are, they might be as old.",,INFO
I'm not sure,,INFO
Kind of lose track,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, that's interesting because we have a simi-,",,INFO
we don't have cats,,INFO
"but we do have a dog,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"who is an indoor dog,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and she is going to be thirteen this summer,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Oh, is that right?",,QUESTION
"Yes, uh-huh.",,CAT
What kind of dog do you have?,,QUESTION
"Um, she's, um, a mix of Cockapoo, Cock-, Cocker Spaniel and Poodle.",,INFO
"Oh, that's what ours is",,INFO
Is that right?,,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
Isn't that interesting ?,,QUESTION
.,,CAT
What color is your dog?,,QUESTION
White.,,INFO
"Oh, well, ours is black,",,INFO
so,,CAT
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
definitely different,,INFO
I'll be darned.,,G_G
"Yes,",,CAT
she's a female,,INFO
"and she's, um, been, she's been a really, a really good companion for me.",,INFO
"Um,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"she's like a little shadow, you know, kind of,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"follows me around all the time,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and, and, um, she's slowing down considerably.",,INFO
She doesn't hear very well,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
she doesn't see very well,,INFO
"but she's,",,CAT
"Well, that's to be expected at,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
their age.,,INFO
"at this age, I guess so.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, um, she's been a good dog to have,",,INFO
"and I don't know,",,INFO
"once she's gone, I'm not sure if I'll get another animal or not",,INFO
"Well, everybody always says no more",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But I, I think animals are really important in the family.",,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"I agree,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"Um, did you get yours as a pet for your chil-,",,QUESTION
do you have children?,,QUESTION
"Uh, yeah,",,CAT
"we,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
have five.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Oh. Well, I was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Well, we have had, we had had, a, a dog before.",,INFO
She was fifteen when she died.,,INFO
My goodness.,,G_G
"And, uh, this one, we bought by accident,",,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to co-, or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"somebody,",,INFO
"people drop things like that off,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"up there,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I said, ""Gee, she sounds like a cute little dog.""",,INFO
"I told the kids, ""Let's go look at her""",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
Go get her.,,INFO
"So that's how we got her,",,INFO
"Isn't that,",,CAT
quite by accident.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
So that often happens that way.,,INFO
"Well, we had, um, intentionally, um, planned to get a dog.",,INFO
"We had just moved into this house and, um, decided to wait about a year and then went,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"then we went out then, and found one,",,INFO
"she was in the litter,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, um, she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy.",,INFO
"I mean, they were all over the place,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and she was real docile and,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"came over and just kind of sat next to us,",,INFO
"and I thought,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
that's the dog for me,,INFO
She picked us,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"so she,",,CAT
"and it,",,CAT
"what was funny was that, um, our daughter must have been,",,INFO
"let's see,",,CAT
"she must have been about eight at the time, I guess,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, um, she just loved this little dog,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
to pieces,,INFO
but I think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her.,,INFO
"I think,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
she was always a little bit leery of her.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Our son, on the other hand, who was about eleven at the time, was, um, not very interested in pets,",,INFO
"but as it turned out, he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals.",,INFO
"Oh, for heaven's sake.",,G_G
So you just never know how that works out,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"But they say it's real important for children to have pets because, uh, well, they can go and talk to them any time,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
they want to and tell them anything they want to,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"nobody is going to, you know, reprimand them or,",,INFO
That's right.,,G_G
know their secrets,,INFO
or,,CAT
"That,",,CAT
"yes,",,CAT
"they're very,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
unjudgmental,,INFO
Yes,,CAT
"Oh, dear",,G_G
"And the nursing homes now, they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"I have been, I have been reading and seeing about that on television.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"and how,",,CAT
"Our one, our one nursing home in has one.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Permanent,,INFO
Is that right?,,QUESTION
"He, he kind of has free run of the place, and there is some-, or somebody takes care of him.",,CAT
Isn't that amazing?,,QUESTION
"But he goes out people,",,INFO
"and real nice dog, uh,",,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"It's funny how, um, how pets can kind of, um, oh, take on a certain status in certain areas.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean, um, that made me think of, uh, when our daughter was looking at colleges, we visited a campus in, um, Saint Louis",,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"um, there were several dogs on the campus",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
"and, the,",,INFO
"what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly,",,INFO
but they didn't appear to belong to anyone.,,INFO
"And, um,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"I'm sure someone, you know, fed them.",,INFO
"They were healthy,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
looking dogs.,,INFO
"But, um, our guide that day said that the la- , one woman many, many years ago had given a huge sum of money to, to the university, on the condition that there be, um, dogs just kind of left to roam aro-, around the campus.",,INFO
Is that right?,,QUESTION
Which is the strangest thing I had ever heard,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"because most campuses don't allow pets,",,INFO
I know.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
they just do not allow them.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
I know.,,INFO
"That's, that's kind of great.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
it really was.,,INFO
"It was just a nice touch,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and it kind of made it seem more homey too,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But, um, th-,",,CAT
I thought that was most unique.,,INFO
"And it just, you know, kind of goes along with what you were saying,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"about the dog having sort of free run of the, the nursing home.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, um, but, uh, I,",,CAT
"this is the only pet we've had sin-,",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"in all our years of marriage, um,",,INFO
"and it's been, uh, sort of a, a change for my husband because as a, a, a boy growing up, his father had dogs",,INFO
"but they were always hunting dogs,",,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"and so they were never allowed in the house, you know,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"they were always kind of,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
we've ruined them,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
That's what he said.,,INFO
They say ruined them,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
.,,CAT
So having a pet was a little bit different for him.,,INFO
"Well, we've had a lot of different pets.",,INFO
"We had, the kids had rabbits for pets,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and we also raised them for food,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
at one time.,,INFO
"Oh, yes.",,CAT
And we've had it . We've had a skunk for a pet.,,INFO
"Oh, my golly.",,G_G
For more years than I want to think about,,INFO
.,,CAT
She was in the house,,INFO
"Oh, gosh.",,G_G
Isn't that interesting?,,QUESTION
I don't think I've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet.,,INFO
"Well, do-, don't ever get one for a pet.",,COMMAND
Oh.,,CAT
"They're okay,",,INFO
"but like she, uh,",,CAT
they don't ever learn their name.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"Uh, you can't, you could never call her and she would come to you,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
you had to go chase her down.,,INFO
I'll be darned.,,G_G
How interesting.,,G_G
"And, uh, their eyesight, they can't see very far either.",,INFO
"But,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I guess I've heard that, uh-huh.",,INFO
"They,",,CAT
"be-, before we got her, everybody said, ""Oh, they're just like a cat,"" you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, they're not",,INFO
.,,CAT
"I mean, they use the litter box.",,INFO
That's about it .,,INFO
Isn't that interesting?,,QUESTION
"That's, that's really something.",,G_G
"Um, how long did you have that?",,QUESTION
"Oh, my, how, how long?",,INFO
Probably seven or eight years.,,INFO
Goodness sake.,,G_G
"And finally, my children are the ones who said, ""Mom, you've put up with that skunk long enough,""",,INFO
"so,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"we moved her to the basement,",,INFO
"and I don't think she was there a week till the men moved her, buil-, built her a pen outside",,INFO
"Oh, my gosh.",,G_G
Isn't that funny?,,QUESTION
"And I thought, I put up with that all those years",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
and this is what it took finally,,INFO
"And,",,INFO
"That is,",,CAT
"we've had, we've had cats,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
stay in the house.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"We had, we had two Siamese cats.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Different times.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, one of them ran off.",,INFO
"She ran off once,",,INFO
"or he, I guess it was a male, he ran off twice,",,INFO
and the second time he never came back.,,INFO
My goodness.,,G_G
"And we would see him, uh, several miles from our house,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
he kind of moved into a woods down there.,,INFO
I'll be.,,G_G
And he got huge down there.,,INFO
My goodness.,,G_G
He really grew,,INFO
"but he,",,INFO
"That's in-,",,G_G
he never came back.,,INFO
That's interesting.,,INFO
"I, I wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat.",,INFO
"Well, he wasn't a whole lot.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"He was in the house most the time,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"but, uh, he did go out sometimes",,INFO
"and, uh, they ma-,",,CAT
it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside.,,INFO

"Yes,",,CAT
"yes,",,CAT
"def-,",,CAT
"I, I, you know, I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help",,INFO
"and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and, and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home",,INFO
and,,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea,,INFO
"and, or the military for a year or two,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"wouldn't be bad for,",,INFO
I think it teaches kids how to grow.,,INFO
How about yourself?,,QUESTION
"Uh, I agree with you.",,CAT
"Uh, uh, what I'm thinking about is back well, when I was a kid, and much earlier than that, kids were kind of, i-, i-,",,INFO
"you know, the parents kind of pushed them to join, like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts",,INFO
"and they did, do, do do a lot of public service activities,",,INFO
"but these days they're not, uh,",,INFO
"par-, parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that.",,INFO
"Because when I was in the Girl Scouts, we did a lot of public service things, because that's just part o-, of, of the scouting, and, you know.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I've, I've,",,CAT
that's really great.,,INFO
"I, I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations.",,INFO
They are,,CAT
"but parents,",,CAT
"You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
they do.,,CAT
"and they don't follow it at all, you know.",,INFO
"There are very few Scouts go on,",,INFO

I think it's a really a good thing.,,INFO
"I, I like to see,",,INFO
"of course, there's, you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country,",,INFO
"But I think,",,INFO
too.,,INFO
we ought to start right here at home.,,INFO
"I'm, you know,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"uh, I'm not, I'm not so sure that overseas help, helping overseas would be such a hot idea for, for, uh, a lot of young k-, people.",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"it, it,",,CAT
"But, since there is much that needs to be done here.",,INFO
"I think that, yeah, I think that we need to really address what we've done here",,INFO
"and, and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well, it's been really good.",,INFO
"We talked about this for a few minutes,",,INFO
"and, uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday,",,INFO

.,,CAT
You know,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"not need, want.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
there is a big difference,,INFO
There's a big difference there.,,INFO

yeah.,,CAT
But most of mine that I use is strictly gasoline.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"oh yeah,",,CAT
"I, I do that,",,INFO
"I do that,",,INFO
"but the rest, like I said, the rest of them I've been trying to, to pay off",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, get back on a cash basis, except for gas.",,INFO
"It's too easy to, to run into the gas station.",,INFO

At least that's for me.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
So.,,CAT
"But yeah,",,CAT

"Yeah,",,CAT
"well that's,",,CAT
"You know, I just, I'm just shocked at the end of the month,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"to see what damage I have did,",,INFO
but,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
I try to keep it pretty reasonable.,,INFO
"Well, I've been pretty lucky in that respect.",,INFO
"I don't charge, like I say, I've, I been trying to, to not charge except for emergencies.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT

"There's, you know,",,CAT
"they have, uh, wonderful features,",,INFO
they're there when you need them.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"You know, like in emergencies, or whatever.",,INFO
"And then they have bad drawbacks, too.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It's, it's awfully easy.",,INFO
"I mean high interest,",,INFO
it's like paying twice.,,INFO
"That's true,",,G_G
"that's true,",,G_G
"Yes,",,CAT
"so, .",,CAT
"I try to,",,CAT
"I did switch to one, uh, sponsored by the credit union, though. That seems to be a pretty low interest.",,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"Yeah, compared to some of the other ones.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"And you don't have an annual fee there,",,INFO
and that helps.,,INFO
"Oh, yes.",,CAT
"Uh, we used to have, you know, like several,",,INFO
"but right now, we're just more or less at American Express,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's one way to do it, because that, that forces you to pay for it",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"instead of saying, well, I'll just",,INFO
"Pay fifteen,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
pay on it this month,,INFO
and,,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT
"I know,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT

And when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time.,,INFO
"Takes a long time,",,CAT
that's right.,,G_G
It sure does.,,G_G
"And now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off, off your income tax",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that's, you know.",,INFO

"and, uh, do you subscribe to any magazines?",,QUESTION

"well, I found that after a couple of years of having a PARENTS magazine it was getting repetitious,",,INFO
so I kind of canceled it anyway for that reason.,,INFO
"Uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazines I do like because they, like you say, they have nice, uh, recipes in them and ideas, but, uh, lately they've just been piling up on me,",,INFO

I don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be,,INFO
Well,,CAT
"even GOOD HOUSEKEEPING I don't,",,INFO

uh-huh.,,CAT
"I have discovered that, you know, with my available time, I would rather actually read a book",,INFO
Yes,,CAT
than a magazine.,,INFO
I enjoy books a lot more,,INFO
Yes,,CAT
that's true.,,INFO
"and, uh.",,CAT
Well,,CAT

other than my children have gotten.,,INFO
"You know, they get tons of magazines it seems",,INFO
Yes,,CAT
they're always getting something in the mail,,INFO

"you know,",,INFO
"and, uh, but I do like the PEOPLE magazine.",,INFO

"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"and, uh, that's one, and you know, I really like that,",,INFO
I enjoy that.,,INFO
It's quick reading,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"it doesn't require a lot of thinking,",,INFO
and sometimes after I've worked all day,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and have things to do at night, I just, I want fluff",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
I don't want a lot of thinking,,INFO
"That's true,",,G_G
that kind of is a good way to do it.,,INFO
"It, uh, you know, it's, it's much more relaxing.",,INFO
"Sometimes when I read TIME magazine, after I've read an article I'm real depressed over the situation of the world",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to, you know, you don't have as many cues,",,INFO
"you can't, don't have hand gestures and things like that.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Well, now, we, uh,",,CAT
what I use a computer for is to write materials that,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"are later printed, though.",,INFO
"Most of the stuff that I do is not, uh, interactive",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I use it for t-, uh, data analysis on testing,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Uh, to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that.",,QUESTION
"Well, just, actually, just, uh, item analysis, statistical analysis of the tests, uh.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"find out how reliable the test is,",,INFO
you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort.,,INFO
"So it's, involves a lot of spreadsheet use.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I would imagine so.,,G_G
"Um, so, um, what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E?",,QUESTION
"Well, I was doing some of the same stuff, but doing it more slowly",,INFO

I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT

Yes.,,CAT

That's right,,CAT

to hear about all the problems.,,INFO
I wondered if you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood?,,QUESTION
"Well, I, I think we have a neighborhood watch",,CAT

I think.,,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
we put up a fence in the backyard.,,INFO

Yeah.,,CAT
playing in the yard.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You know.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
And I guess most of the crime that I'm concerned about generally is against my kids.,,INFO
It's scary to send them off down the street a few houses *,,INFO
"Oh, I'm sure it is.",,G_G
To let them go play with someone and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
because of what you hear about people getting picked up and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
everything,,INFO
and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
so I have to spend a good deal of time watching them,,INFO
.,,CAT
"walk down the street and,",,INFO

Um.,,CAT
come back,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"I would, too, if I had kids.",,CAT
We don't have any.,,INFO
"We did install a, a a, uh, motion detector light back in our driveway.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT

but also we have a boat back there,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief,",,INFO
so,,CAT
"Oh, no.",,G_G
"we thought with that light, you know, it would maybe keep them from doing something to the boat",,INFO
That's a good thought.,,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
"so,",,CAT
"Well, we've been real lucky that,",,INFO
"I don't believe there's been, you know, much trouble in our neighborhood,",,INFO
but it,,INFO

"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, it's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but it doesn't mean you'll be safe,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
I know it.,,G_G
"But, I guess I take a lot of, uh, little bit of, uh, safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are, like drug related or",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, things that,",,INFO
places usually that I wouldn't be going.,,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
and so it's been interesting to come to the Plano area where the schools don't have fences at all,,INFO
.,,CAT
"around them,",,INFO
"and it's just a whole different idea that, that, at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And in Houston that there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school.,,INFO

I must admit I'm not always real politically active,,INFO
"but I do think that, um, Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And it's brought the,",,INFO
"they, uh, really listen to",,INFO
"the, the, uh, lobbyist and, uh, the car manufacturing companies have, uh, you know, have really pushed,",,INFO
"they ,",,CAT
"all those re-, restrictions are really too hard,",,INFO
"we can't, we can't quite make that go",,INFO
and they don't,,CAT
and then we still live with air pollution.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Um, so I suspect that that's one thing that, that as individuals, we can do, make our voices known, perhaps to our legislators.",,INFO
"But, um, as a society, I think we can do more",,INFO
"and that's probably how we ought to do it. Uh, individ-, being individually responsible as, uh, gro-, in order to be group responsible.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I guess I'm, I'm to the point where I'm cynical enough that I really don't believe anything will happen unless, unless there's something economically justifiable about it.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And in the case of air pollution, it simply might turn out at some point down the road, to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and everything else that we'll spend the money that's necessary to, uh, to get rid of the source of it.",,INFO
"I suspect that the pub-, that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure, uh, come to bear on the companies that deal with it",,INFO
"and probably the only way that can happen is for, um, governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, I don't know how long that, that will take.",,INFO
People also have to realize they can't have their cake and eat it.,,INFO
"So, if you don't want to burn coal for power,",,QUESTION
Sure.,,CAT
"how about nucle-, nuclear energy.",,INFO
Well we don't want that either.,,INFO
"Exactly,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
How about investing in the sun.,,QUESTION
"Well nobody wants to pay twenty-five cents a kilowatt hour, I don't think.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, I probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it.",,INFO
"Well it's just the same thing with the car, uh, uh, the gasoline,",,INFO
"now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline,",,INFO
"Oh yes,",,CAT
"yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"so that we don't, uh, run into the kind of problems we recently had",,INFO
and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent,,INFO
"and they don't want, they don't want to pay for it.",,INFO
"So instead, we spend billions of dollars going to war.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"Uh, you know, wha-,",,CAT
"however, it might have had other causes.",,CAT
Certainly oil was a big factor.,,INFO
"Oh certainly,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"Um, and I think that's probably going to happen with, with such things as air pollution,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"when we, when we se-, get serious about cleaning, about our motors in our automobiles then, uh, then maybe, you know, we'll have a little bit of help. Um, uh,",,INFO
do you have any air pollution in your area?,,QUESTION
There's not really a lot here in Raleigh.,,CAT
"Uh, once in a while we'll get some, uh,",,INFO
"I think it kind of washes down from, uh, from your area Linda",,INFO
Oh no.,,G_G
"That's what they, that's what they,",,CAT
"You're talking about from, from the, uh, the middle, middle states,",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"that, that have more factories and so on.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
that's what they say,,INFO
"but it's it's not, it's not very usual",,INFO
and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
we really don't have that either.,,INFO
"Although I think I can tell a difference in, I lived in this area for about twenty-five years and I think I can tell a difference in the comfort level, uh, particularly in the summer. Uh, you know, when it gets hot,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"and you have, the, that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air, uh, usually they say caused by exhaust.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It seems to me that I'm more uncomfortable,,INFO
"and, you know, my eyes sting more and so on and so on.",,INFO
"So I suspect that it's, it's an ever growing problem.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Well I suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"I think,",,INFO
It was nice talking to you.,,G_G
we've given them about seven minutes according to my watch,,INFO
and I enjoyed the conversation.,,G_G
So did I.,,G_G
"Bye, bye.",,G_G
Bye.,,G_G

"I mean, I just didn't know.",,INFO
"So, uh.",,CAT
"Well, um, so well do you, do you feel that it was worth what we did over there?",,QUESTION
"Um, yeah,",,CAT
just a second.,,COMMAND
Okay.,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
"Sure,",,CAT
"now. Well, Mark, um, what was that again?",,QUESTION
"Um, do you think, I mean, do you think, our invest-, the investment in lives and money was worth it?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"not, not really.",,CAT
I totally agree with that. Um.,,CAT
Um.,,CAT
"What, what effects do you think it's had on our country?",,QUESTION
"Downside. Um, uh, well,",,INFO
"the says we should, uh, go into the grief that, that's there",,INFO
"and, you know, presidents have always avoided that",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
as a country.,,INFO
"So it's pretty serious, really, you know,",,INFO
lot of things that aren't being addressed.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I think you know, that's pretty typical that, of the entire, entire involvement over that, you know, that nothing was really addressed,",,INFO
"it was-, it wasn't, you know, it was never",,INFO
"we, we announced that we were going to war,",,INFO
"it was such a gradual and subtle, you know",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT

Oh,,CAT
Isn't that something?,,QUESTION
"Uh-huh. Um,",,CAT
"so, um, do, do, do you think that like, uh, um, for example like in, in this past war, in the Persian Gulf war",,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that, uh, that you see, it seemed to me that, that Bush was going, going to extraordinary lengths to, um, you know, prepare the country for war.",,INFO
Hey Mark,,COMMAND
Yeah.,,CAT
"I've got to go, um.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT

Bye.,,G_G
,,
Go ahead.,,COMMAND
"Um, I haven't given this a, a lot of thought.",,INFO
"I'm, uh, that, that's a whole, pleased with the pr-, practice that is they,",,INFO
"I, uh, I don't,",,CAT
"you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand that's arguable but that, that, uh, people who's jobs are critical to public safety should have to meet special standards.",,INFO
"Uh, I haven't given this matter enough thought.",,INFO
Do you work for T I?,,QUESTION
"No, uh,",,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
I'm in the Washington area.,,INFO
I work for N I S T .,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"Oh, all right.",,CAT
"Well, see we have the testing already here.",,INFO
"We've had it for, oh, about five years.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
It used to just be for new employees.,,INFO
And now,,INFO
"And now,",,CAT
it's for all employees.,,INFO
"They, uh, randomly select employee numbers",,INFO
"and, uh, the day that they select you is when you have to go and, and be tested.",,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
and how do people feel about it?,,QUESTION
"So, we're familiar with it.",,INFO
"Oh, we have a lot of, um, people upset about it at the beginning. Some not all.",,INFO
"But what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse. Um, mainly the areas whe-, where they were doing a lot of, um, manufacturing type things",,INFO
"and what they ended up doing is, uh, kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening,",,INFO
"and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing, you know, on the premises.",,INFO
"Well, okay,",,CAT
"that's, that's a very different issue.",,INFO
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
"it was, you know, combination of, of, uh, both activities and, uh, and using too",,INFO
"so they developed this, uh, drug policy so that, uh, to eliminate,",,INFO
"there's some parts of the company that we do, uh, government contracts,",,INFO
"and I think some of those require the drug testing,",,INFO
"but now T I thought well, we'll just do it for all employees that, um, not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in",,INFO
"and that we shouldn't have, um, people on drugs within our, you know, offices and such.",,INFO
"And,",,CAT
"I haven't personally ever been tested,",,INFO
but I don't have a problem with it.,,INFO
"Um, does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"but one thing that to, to me was, um, going on, stretching it a little too far was that they also check, um, if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug.",,INFO
"You know, it happens a lot of times",,INFO
like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever,,INFO
"and, you know",,INFO
"Well ,",,CAT
"then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the, you know, doctor and get another prescription.",,INFO
"Well, according to what they do at T I, if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name.",,INFO
"It, you know, it can't be in your spouse's name",,INFO
"so they will look, I mean, the testing will look for, I guess, any kind of drugs,",,INFO
and you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for.,,INFO
So they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking?,,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"When you get tested you are supposed to tell them, you know, everything that, that might be there.",,INFO
"And then if they ever, um, question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"Well, it, I mean, it's, I guess that, in fact, they don't test for, for, they don't routinely test for very many prescription drugs",,INFO
"but that I, but they don't say in advance , uh,",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Well, what they wo-, be testing for are the ones that would have like, you know, barbiturates or codeine things like that in them.",,INFO
The ones that would kind of constitute controlled substances or something anyway .,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"I guess that's what i-, they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and an-, antibiotics and stuff.",,INFO
"They would be looking for the, yeah, controlled things, barbiturates amphetamines.",,INFO
So what they are asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"You pretty much, you know, put down what you remember even if it was just Contact or something like that.",,INFO
"But afterwards, uh, maybe if you had a controlled substance",,INFO
"Is Contact a,",,QUESTION
"Well,",,INFO
"Bo-,",,INFO
"you, you probably put down, you know, you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"Is Contact a,",,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
substance?,,INFO
"I'm,",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"just saying you probably pro-, put down on the sheet",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
anything you have taken.,,INFO
"But if they had a controlled substance, maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name.",,INFO
"I know I had one contract employee through Manpower was not a T I person,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but was a contract person,",,INFO
"and they test them too even if you are not a real, uh, T I -er.",,INFO
If you are a contract employee here,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
they test you too.,,INFO
"And he had taken some kind of, um, oh, you know, uh,",,INFO
"just, he had some kind of flu or something.",,INFO
He got a real bad migraine,,INFO
"and he took his mother's,",,INFO
,,
"Okay, um,",,CAT
I don't know about you,,INFO
but where I am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work,,INFO
and it varies like every day. I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next,,INFO
.,,CAT
"It's pretty bad,",,INFO
"but it's true, you know,",,INFO
"they tend to try to be, you know, real lax",,INFO
"and supposedly the policy is like, you know, we, you know, we, hire these wonderful creative people",,INFO
"and we don't want to smush their creativity, you know.",,INFO
We want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want.,,INFO
"And, you know, you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next.",,INFO
"Well, I'm kind of that way too.",,INFO
I work in the legal department,,INFO
"and where we are now, what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day,",,INFO
it always seems like I'm doing that,,INFO
"and I can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry, you know, boxes of documents around,",,INFO
"so, if I'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing, you know, odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents, I dress down.",,INFO
"But if we're going to have a meeting, where we're having the attorneys come in, or people from, uh, other party's attorneys and stuff, then I normally dress up.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
and I'll wear a dress and hose and stuff.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you know, we're kind of that way too.",,INFO
"I try to,",,INFO
"I'm the same way you are,",,INFO
I kind of try to judge from day to day.,,INFO
"I know, you know, where I am we work a lot with the customers",,INFO
and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, you know, if I know that they're going to be there, you know, you, I try to really watch it and like you say, you know, really dress up",,INFO
"and if I know they're not, you know,",,INFO
"I, I've been doing a lot of reorganization, you know, the last couple of months the same way you are, you know,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it's just , it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress.",,INFO
"That's right,",,CAT
that's right.,,CAT
It is,,INFO
"and so,",,CAT
"As a matter of fact, I thought I had one funny story",,INFO
"when, uh, I was at T I the first year or so, we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes.",,INFO
"We had them in the warehouse,",,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"and at that point, it, the warehouse was over across the road",,INFO
"and it wasn't air conditioned,",,INFO
"and, it, we were there like in the middle of the summer,",,INFO
"it's unair-conditioned,",,INFO
"it was dusty and dirty, uh,",,INFO
there was like a fan at the very end of the row,,INFO
and that was it.,,INFO
"And so, we didn't really know we weren't supposed to,",,INFO
"we thought T I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
we wore shorts.,,INFO
"We didn't know that was a big no, no.",,INFO
Oh no.,,G_G
And the supervisor from another area came up to us,,INFO
"and, you know, this area where record retention is, there's only a few people that work there,",,INFO
"and he, sho-, he knew who worked there,",,INFO
he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there.,,INFO
And he came up to us,,INFO
"and he just said, who's your supervisor.",,INFO
"Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor, and our supervisor's supervisor,",,INFO
"and it went up all the way to the head of facilities,",,INFO
Oh no,,G_G
complaining that we were wearing shorts.,,INFO
"He didn't at, at least say to us, did you know you're not supposed to do that.",,INFO
That could have alleviated a big problem.,,INFO
We ended up getting called out on it.,,INFO
"Oh, how awful.",,G_G
It sounds like Mister Power Hungry.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, just yesterday, though, I saw a girl in the spine out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I don't care,",,INFO
you can call them split skirts,,INFO
and you can call them culottes all you want,,INFO
but these were shorts.,,INFO
That's all they were.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"I don't care what else you call them, you know,",,INFO
"if they're below the knee, okay,",,INFO
maybe you can call them split skirts.,,INFO
"If they're above the knee they turn into shorts, you know.",,INFO
.,,CAT
And these weren't even really full ones.,,INFO
"I mean they had a problem out here with it last summer, wearing these shorts that were, you know, the real wide full ones, you know,",,INFO
"and becau-, these weren't even those.",,INFO
"These were like pretty short, black,",,INFO
"and they were very dressy,",,INFO
the were black velvet shorts,,INFO
and she had on black hose and black heels,,INFO
"and she looked very, very nice.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"But, you don't wear shorts to work.",,INFO
"You know, I mean, as far as I'm considered, she was in violation",,INFO
and nobody says anything to them.,,INFO
It's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"You know, if they just, you know,",,CAT
"the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an, cut off, you know, that no,",,INFO
this is wear we're going to draw the line.,,INFO
"This is shorts, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that, you know,",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"so, it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going, well God, we have a pair of those at home too.",,INFO
"It sure would be cool and comfortable to wear, you know,",,INFO
but.,,CAT
Well I've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And they have said no,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"and then during the week you see these women, in the you know,",,INFO
"just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean I've never seen them do it without hose,",,INFO
"I mean they always have hose on,",,INFO
"but still, it's, they're shorts,",,INFO
"I don't care what you say,",,INFO
they're shorts.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"Well I think T I's dress code is pretty lax considering everything, anyway, you know, uh.",,INFO
"I know, I didn't know that E D S has a very strict dress code,",,INFO
"I had a friend,",,INFO
Oh do they really?,,QUESTION
Oh definitely.,,CAT
I had a friend who worked there for a year or so,,INFO
and they spell it out.,,INFO
"For men it's particular suits, uh, the pin stripe, and the particular colors of shirts and win-, wing tipped shoes.",,INFO
"Oh, my God.",,G_G
"Oh, it is definitely lined out.",,INFO
"Women are not allowed to wear slacks,",,INFO
you wear coordinated suits.,,INFO
"I coul-, I couldn't afford to work there.",,INFO
"And, and a particular kind of shoe, you know, so high heel,",,INFO
oh it is spelled out.,,INFO
"Oh, no.",,G_G
"When I was looking at her materials when she first started, you know, she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And it told about the dress code,,INFO
"and it said, these are the color pastel shirts you may wear, or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and, hair just this way.",,INFO
T I -s says no shorts and no halters,,INFO
"I know, that's it.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and E D S is very particular about this, hair cuts,",,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"I mean it was like you can't have, you know, such and such facial hair, no beards, you know, and just really detailed.",,INFO
I don't know that that would be a good environment to work in.,,INFO
"I mean, I see,",,CAT
"I, I am more,",,INFO
"I don't know about anybody else,",,INFO
"and a lot of bosses may say I'm nuts,",,INFO
but I am more productive when I'm in pants.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"I, I am.",,INFO
"I work faster,",,INFO
"I get things done faster, than when I'm in a dress and heels, you know,",,INFO
"I,",,CAT
and it's weird,,INFO
"but I, it's I do, I can, I can get so much more done if I'm dressed comfortable, you know.",,INFO
"Well the, the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had, uh, another person coming from Washington, our outside counsel.",,INFO
And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse,,INFO
"but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse, but the warehouse.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And she came with skirts, just like she'd be going into the office.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And we'd try, we'd try to say, didn't you bring any pants or anything.",,INFO
"We're, we're out here in the warehouse, you know,",,INFO
"you, you got your skid of, you know, that wooden pallet of boxes.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and you're going to have un-, unload you skid look at the documents in the, in the boxes and then repack your skid.",,INFO
And she,,INFO
You can't do that in a skirt poor soul.,,INFO
"And she was so, she was so hot and miserable, you know, in the skirt.",,INFO
Oh yuck.,,G_G
"She finally tried to go buy, you know, a pair of pants",,INFO
"but, you know, I mean it was just completely miserable for her.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's terrible,",,G_G
that's terrible,,G_G
gosh.,,G_G
.,,CAT
"Well I don't know,",,CAT
"I just figure, you know, yeah,",,INFO
"sometimes I worry about, you know, if I go in in pants,",,INFO
"and I never, I never ever, ever, ever go in in a pair of jeans, you know.",,INFO
But I'll go in in pants.,,INFO
"I mean today I had on a pair of, you know, navy blue dress slacks and, and, uh, like a peach colored top and, you know, not cruddy, but not a dress either.",,INFO
"And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that would, will hold you back, you know, if you don't dress in, you know, your dress for success business suits everyday if, you know, if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on,",,INFO
"but, you know, I don't know if they do or not.",,INFO
"You know, I see a lot of the managers",,INFO
"and they're in jeans,",,INFO
"so, you know.",,CAT
"Some of our people in the legal department,",,INFO
"we have, um, assistants to the general counsel",,INFO
and it's funny,,INFO
"because, there's one that always wears a suit.",,INFO
"A matter of fact, he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on, buttoned.",,INFO
"Really, wow.",,G_G
"And then there's another one who's, who's a little younger and a little more yuppish",,INFO
"and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and, you know, a shirt,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and sometimes he wears the jacket to it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes,,INFO
and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt.,,INFO
"So that's just,",,CAT
Isn't that funny.,,QUESTION
"With the, you know, the little suspenders or something on",,INFO
so.,,INFO
That's great.,,G_G
"We've, we've kind of had a variety there",,INFO
"but, I think a lot of times it's, it's mainly who they're going to meet with,",,INFO
or they're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"If they're just going to be meeting with T I -ers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the, they're engineers that they're talking too, they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed",,INFO
and they're usually casual.,,INFO
That's the way to do it. I mean that's the smart way to do it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It really is, because your making, you know,",,INFO
"if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down, if they come in, in, you know, a six hundred dollar three piece suit, it's going to make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable, you know,",,INFO
"or it would me, you know.",,CAT
It's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"look at this slick guy,",,COMMAND
"I wonder what kind of money does he make,",,INFO

Well it was good to talk to you.,,G_G
It was really enjoyable.,,G_G
"Yeah,",,G_G
"this is, this is kind of a fun project.",,G_G
It really is.,,CAT
"I've done some of the other speech programs,",,INFO
"but we've never got to talk to another person,",,INFO
it was always just talking to the computer.,,INFO
"Oh, yuck,",,G_G
yeah.,,CAT
So this is a little different.,,INFO

"So, do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have?",,QUESTION
"Uh, actually no,",,CAT
"because, because I'm in school.",,INFO
"I, I kind of miss out on most of the current events.",,INFO
I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it.,,INFO
Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then?,,QUESTION
"Uh, I don't watch a lot of it,",,CAT
"but that's the on-,",,CAT
basically that's my only major source of information.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"What about, what about you?",,QUESTION
"Well, I read, uh,",,INFO
I get a bunch of different things.,,INFO
I get a newspaper every day,,INFO
"and I try to at, at least have a few minutes to look through that",,INFO
"and I look through, uh,",,INFO
"I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I, I pretty much read that cover to cover",,INFO
"and I, as far as, you know,",,CAT
that satisfies most of the short term news I get.,,INFO
"Uh, don't watch much T V,",,INFO
don't have enough time,,INFO
"and, uh, don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that, you know,",,INFO
they might give you a little blurbs like,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
this happened or that happened,,INFO
and that's about all I ever hear of it.,,INFO
"Uh, but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK",,INFO
"and for the longer term I, I read, uh, like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and, and, uh, READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which, they,",,INFO
"the news isn't, like, immediate what you'd generally think of as news,",,INFO
but it's recent material.,,INFO
And it's more in depth.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it is, it is more in depth, less broad.",,INFO
"Well, actually, it's, probably isn't less broad,",,CAT
but it's just more in depth,,INFO
"and, uh, it is, it is more sig-, it is more just significant information, you know.",,INFO
"It is the big events, not the little events.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main, you know.",,INFO
"I know,",,CAT
where they're just trying to fill in.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"or they're making, making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, I get kind of bored watching T V actually, when I watch the news on T V because",,INFO
"I know,",,CAT
"I do, I do, too.",,INFO
it goes so slow,,INFO
"and, then there's nothing that, you know, really is like oh, so exciting.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you may find one little, uh, news item interesting",,INFO
"so you have to wait twenty minutes to, to hear about it.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that, that's about what it ends up being.",,INFO
Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"actually, y-, you mention NEWSWEEK,",,INFO
"I, I, I do like, uh, U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT.",,INFO
"I don't get to read it as much as I like,",,INFO
"but that's, I think that's a good magazine.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think they're about the same.,,INFO
"I, you know, they, they certainly have a very similar, uh, charter at least in my mind.",,INFO
"And, uh, uh, what, what kind of, uh, what kind of news normally interests you,",,QUESTION
"I mean what do you, what, what do you find interesting",,QUESTION
Well,,INFO
versus what do you find boring?,,INFO
"right now trying to keep abreast of, uh, what's going on in Europe, you know, with all the, U S S R's satellites breaking off, trying to become independent and, you know, European community coming together.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"That's going to affect our, uh, economy quite a bit.",,INFO
"I think it will,",,CAT
"uh, they, they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence,",,INFO
but we've yet to see it,,INFO
"and th-,",,CAT
"it's real short term yet, though,",,INFO
"I mean, it's only been, three months or something like that",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
since that happened,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
But they like to tell us that it's going to be important,,INFO
"I'm, I'm pretty sure it is, because, uh",,INFO
"I think it is, too.",,CAT
"once, once Europe becomes unified and, uh, their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be, uh, kind of hurting",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I think that's a possibility,",,INFO
"uh, it, we might also be helped, though, because it, it will be easier to do business over there, too.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
definitely.,,CAT
For the companies that already have a presence over there,,INFO
"and, uh, I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it",,INFO
"Oh, yeah",,CAT
came time.,,INFO
"so they have a toe hold,",,INFO
I good toe hold.,,INFO
Yep.,,CAT
"Because once you're in there, then you can easily expand.",,INFO
But getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"because, when they first start off, they're going to be highly protectionist",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
Yes.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"And there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist,",,INFO
"even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Like, England doesn't want to do one thing",,INFO
"and, and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing",,INFO
"and they're, they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And some of it, I mean, is,",,CAT
"I'm sure within those people's minds, it's quite justified.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I can understand their viewpoint,",,INFO
"they're just, they're starting off,",,INFO
"their economy's a little bit weak,",,INFO
so you want to,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
get established before they,,INFO
Before they,,INFO
"com-,",,INFO
open up their borders to everyone.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
totally.,,CAT
"Uh, what is the, uh,",,QUESTION
do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that?,,QUESTION
Actually I'm not really into sports.,,CAT
"My roommates are,",,CAT

.,,CAT
.,,CAT
Against your will.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"we have to, fight over the remote control.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
at least you guys have a remote control.,,INFO
.,,CAT
It's sometimes better to not have one of those.,,INFO
"Course, you can always mislocate it.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Or misplace it, I mean, not mislocate it, but misplace it",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
,,
"I'm Nevin from Sunnyvale, California.",,INFO
"Hi,",,G_G
"this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis, Minnesota.",,INFO
How you doing?,,G_G
Pretty good.,,G_G
Good.,,G_G
"Uh, I guess the topic is trial by jury and",,INFO
Yep.,,CAT
how we should change that or how we would change it.,,INFO
"Uh, I'm ready whenever you are.",,INFO
Okay,,CAT
"So, uh, what are your, what are your thoughts on the subject there?",,QUESTION
"Well I definitely think, like decisions have to be unanimous.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think that's probably a good thing.,,INFO
It's probably the safest thing.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, it's to easy to get a quorum",,INFO
Yep,,CAT
and simple majority won't do.,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"And even like, you know, two-thirds majority, I mean, it's",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
quorums are to easy to get.,,INFO
Yep.,,CAT
"And there's always that, that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason, you know.",,INFO
*,,CAT
"So it's, it's",,CAT
Yeah *,,CAT
definitely,,CAT
"but, uh, I don't know.",,CAT
"I could, I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Like Gives them a little too much power,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"Tha-,",,CAT
"I, I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that. Or arguing against that pretty vehemently.",,INFO
"But, uh,",,CAT
"Plus, you know, you may be, you know, doing, you know, a, a guilty verdict",,INFO
"but it may not be, you know, it may be for technical reasons",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"About the only good thing I would say about that is it w-, that it would, uh, hurry the process up a bit",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"but I mean even now we've got, I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that",,INFO
and,,CAT
I know .,,CAT
that's what the trial by jury.,,INFO
"I mean, jeez if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
whose to say.,,INFO
"It,",,CAT
there would be much more of that,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
no doubt.,,CAT
Are you involved in the legal system at all?,,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
But I .,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"I tend to follow it just to, just to know what's going on.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
I've got some friends that are lawyers,,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
I do too,,INFO
so.,,CAT
One of them just got his law degree.,,INFO
"But, uh, to tell you the truth, I'm not real familiar with, uh, the system of juris-, jurisprudence the way it is right now.",,INFO
No.,,CAT
I really haven't studied it in depth.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I know a little more about civil cases when, than criminal cases.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Which is,",,INFO
"it's more in how you present it versus, you know, who's right.",,INFO
I'm sure of it.,,CAT
"Because a lot of those things, it's all, it's in, it's largely a matter of viewpoint.",,INFO
Yep.,,CAT
And who can argue their case better.,,INFO
*,,CAT
"Uh, it's kind of weird.",,INFO
"I don't know,",,CAT
you I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something.,,INFO
*,,CAT
And how weird those cases get.,,INFO
I know. *,,CAT
"It's just,",,CAT
"When I was, a couple of years ago, involved in some pretrial stuff and *",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"like, you know, you go say okay, we can't bring up this point because then they're going to, you know,",,INFO
"the opposition will say this, this and this and",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And it's like, boy, the stuff that they can twist around",,INFO
Yep,,CAT
"is,",,INFO
it's pretty amazing.,,INFO
"And it's like the, the truth isn't really important anymore.",,INFO
"It's,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
it's not.,,CAT
"And then you get people who, who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because.",,INFO
Yep.,,CAT
"Like this, this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious",,INFO
and he really gets into suing people.,,INFO
*,,CAT
"And so he'll, he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court,",,INFO
*,,INFO
"and argue his case you know,",,INFO
"it's like, *",,CAT
That sounds like a little abuse of our system *,,CAT
"but,",,CAT
"It is. It's, it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else. *",,INFO
"But, uh,",,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
"but it's for the more general,",,CAT
people don't want to take responsibility.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, it's,",,CAT
"And, and most of the time they're looking to place blame. Uh",,INFO
Yep,,CAT
and stuff.,,INFO
"See, you're from California,",,INFO
is that right?,,QUESTION
"Uh, yeah.",,CAT
Well originally from Chicago,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
I was just thinking,,INFO
"I wonder, I wonder how, how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say where I am in Minneapolis.",,QUESTION
"I really,",,CAT
"From what I understand, it's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"And Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the,",,INFO
"what is it,",,CAT
it's based on common law,,INFO
and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
the rest of the country is not or something like that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Pretty strange.,,INFO
"But, uh, fortunately I never have had to go in",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I haven't either other than,",,CAT
"even, even for jury duty.",,INFO
"But, uh, that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in for, uh, as a witness.",,INFO
He may subpoena me.,,INFO
*,,CAT
So we'll see what happens.,,INFO
"But, uh,",,CAT
Yeah. *,,CAT
I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better. .,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It's,",,CAT
"there are too many big problems, you know.",,INFO
"There's, there's such a backlog of court cases right now.",,INFO
I know.,,CAT
"You know, to try to get them all in in a good time",,INFO
and we already have too many lawyers as it is.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And if it's criminal cases we, you can't put them in jail because there's no room left.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"And, in fact, they're even letting some go.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I, I'm originally from Florida",,INFO
and it's like,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them, you know.",,INFO
"That's not a, that's not a good solution either.",,INFO
Not at all.,,CAT
"I'm not real sure what the,",,INFO
,,
"Hi,",,G_G
how are you today?,,G_G
I'm great,,G_G
Good.,,G_G
"Well as a matter of fact I'm, before we started this conversation I was working on my P C at home.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Do you have one?,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
I don't have one at home.,,INFO
"I work with one on, at work",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"continually, you know,",,INFO
but I do not have one of my own at home.,,INFO
"Do you have,",,CAT
"What do you have, at home?",,QUESTION
"We have an, um,",,CAT
"actually it's a T I computer,",,INFO
but it is the I B M,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"um, clone.",,INFO
It's not the T I P C,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
from back when.,,INFO
From the oldies but the goodies.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"It's probably pretty close to what I have, because I have the same kind of thing at work.",,INFO
"I have a three eighty-six S X which is T I computer,",,INFO
"but everything in, is in I B M mode.",,INFO
So.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's what we have. Um.,,INFO
Do you use it a lot at home?,,QUESTION
"Well, I really do.",,CAT
"I, um, am an accountant",,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but I work at home.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So you're on it a lot.,,QUESTION
So I use it for that quite often.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"We have, you know, used some of it for some personal things.",,INFO
We keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it.,,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"since it's tax season, I'm doing a lot of taxes,",,INFO
"so I do a lot of, um, a lot of that work on it as well.",,INFO
I was amazed when I took our taxes to our tax person,,INFO
and she works out of her home also.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And the, uh, software that does the taxes is just incredible.",,INFO
Oh it is.,,CAT
"You know, I mean, she just, you know,",,CAT
"I expected to go and, you know, drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later.",,INFO
"And, you know, she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little P C.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
you can.,,INFO
It was great.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"you can,",,INFO
that's right.,,CAT
That's wonderful.,,G_G
"I have often thought that, that having one at home would be neat.",,INFO
I just don't know if we would really use it that much. You know.,,INFO
"We really,",,CAT
"we deci-, we didn't decide to get one until I started working at home.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Then, you know, then, we thought, well we can use it for, you know, some personal things.",,INFO
"We di-,",,CAT
"for us it really took, you know, a business application",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
to justify the expense of it.,,INFO
"Oh, definitely,",,CAT
definitely.,,CAT
"I know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer, oh, I guess, probably three years ago for Christmas,",,INFO
"and, you know, it's got some stuff on it.",,INFO
"It's got a nice little word processing software on it, you know, and some budgeting type things and stuff.",,INFO
And I don't think she's ever touched it,,INFO
Really.,,CAT
you know.,,INFO
"It just, it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home.",,INFO
"You know, she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer you know.",,INFO
So.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
She could just as easily do those things by hand.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
just as quickly.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Now I know my boss has bought the software, um, that he can, that his checkbook is on, on",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"on a disk,",,INFO
"and he goes in and prin-, and types his checks on the screen and then hits print,",,INFO
"and they print out on the checks,",,INFO
and he's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places,,INFO
Oh my gosh.,,G_G
"you know,",,INFO
"and he just whips, out, you know,",,INFO
"I saw him yesterday morning over there,",,INFO
"and, and he paid his monthly bills,",,INFO
"and he just, you know, wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print",,INFO
"and it printed out like ten checks,",,INFO
"and he just, you know,",,CAT
"they're perforated,",,INFO
and he just ripped them off.,,INFO
They go through just a continuous thing on the printer,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes,,INFO
and there they went.,,INFO
"You know, and he said, you know, I can balance my checkbook in seconds, you know",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"because it's all in the computer, you know.",,INFO
So.,,CAT
And you know there's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make.,,INFO
That's exactly why.,,CAT
"He said, you know, he said, used to be I always sat looking for those, you know.",,INFO
He said this way there isn't any.,,INFO
"You know, it does it for you.",,INFO
"So. This, you know,",,CAT
"there are some definitely, some, some advantages to it.",,INFO
"It's just a matter of, like you say, are the advantages, does it justify the cost, if you're using it strictly for personal business.",,INFO
So.,,CAT
Right,,CAT
"I, I think in most cases I'd have to say no.",,INFO
Not unless somebody really enjoys it.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Or perhaps is using it for education.,,INFO
"I have a four year old son,",,INFO
and we have some education programs that he likes.,,INFO
A little Sesame Street one,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"and we have another one that plays music,",,INFO
and he really likes that one.,,INFO
As he grows up he'll be even more and more too.,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
That'll be great.,,G_G
"And yeah,",,CAT
"on,",,CAT
"now I think about it,",,INFO
"I guess for, for kids like, as they get older,",,INFO
especially now,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"when they get to junior high school, high school, and even college.",,INFO
"I mean, my sister went to college, started about three years ago,",,INFO
"and she had to have a, a computer.",,INFO
Really.,,CAT
"I mean, it was like a necessity.",,INFO
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
I.,,CAT
She couldn't imagine going through college without a computer.,,INFO
Well I'm going through right now.,,INFO
"I'm, you know, going part time in the evenings,",,INFO
"and, you know, I do,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
everything has to be typed.,,INFO
"I mean, they require it.",,INFO
You have to type it,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"and, and so I'm up here, you know, nights and weekends you know, working on the little p-, on the P C up here, you know, typing stuff.",,INFO
"So I can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home, you know, if you were going to school.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"any more I don't even know if they have, if a college kid would have a typewriter",,QUESTION
"Well, you,",,CAT
I don't know.,,CAT
"Probably not even,",,INFO
no.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
and they probably used to have it.,,INFO
"I just finished a, a major research paper a couple of weeks ago,",,INFO
and I couldn't imagine not having that thing on a disk,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
where I could go back in and move stuff around and change it.,,INFO
"I, I don't know what they used to do before they,",,INFO
"Well, unfortunately in our family, my husband and I went through college together",,INFO
and then he went on and got his Master's degree while I was working.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I'm the better typist,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"of us,",,INFO
"and we just had a regular old typewriter, not even a correcting one back then.",,INFO
Oh,,QUESTION
"It wasn't that long ago,",,INFO
but,,INFO
and you had to type all of his papers.,,INFO
I typed his Master's papers and things on a typewriter.,,INFO
"Oh gosh,",,G_G
"Oh boy, to have a computer back then.",,INFO
"Oh, cut your time in half at least.",,INFO
At least.,,G_G
At least.,,CAT
"I mean,",,CAT
"and then of course you have some changes to make, and do the whole thing over.",,INFO
"You take out a sentence,",,INFO
"on a computer you take it out, bleep, print it out, fine.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Take out a sentence on a piece of paper,",,CAT
You do the whole thing over.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
That's right.,,CAT
"You know, I remember when I was working in high school, you know, I was working in an office, right after I got out of high school",,INFO
I continued working there for probably another year.,,INFO
And we did everything on a typewriter,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
everything.,,INFO
"But it's amazing, you know,",,INFO
"then, when, where, you know, someone would have you type a letter, they did it right, they did it right.",,INFO
"I mean, they were,",,CAT
The first time.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
they sit there,,INFO
"and they go, is this really what I want to say,",,INFO
and you typed it,,INFO
"and that was it,",,INFO
"and now, you know people just send it back over and over and over and over.",,INFO
"That's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it's brought about, because people do feel like, Oh well, we can just change it.",,INFO
"Well, we'll try this out and see what it looks like.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT

I believe it.,,G_G

"and it's like, you know, it's ridiculous",,INFO
"and that was, that was the high week,",,INFO
but it's running about seventy,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types.,,INFO
"Well, it's good that she does that, I mean, bring it to people's attention.",,INFO
"Well, that's exactly right.",,CAT
"You know, she keeps, you know keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show, you know, look, this didn't really need to be changed.",,INFO

"You know, I mean, that's the kind of things, you know, that she's keeping and showing, that, this was a big waste of time, it was a waste of paper, it was a waste, you know",,INFO

to change something like that.,,INFO
"So. Anyway, maybe, you know, maybe it'll, it'll help in some way,",,INFO
but I don't know.,,CAT

"It was very expensive, because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance, you know.",,INFO
It was like a,,INFO
Ooh.,,CAT
long distance phone call.,,INFO

that still could add up.,,INFO
Oh it added up big.,,CAT
"Well, you know, we, my parents were divorced",,INFO

so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT

,,
"Okay,",,CAT
what do you think is the biggest problem?,,QUESTION
"The biggest problem, well, like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that, uh, you know, you can throw money at it,",,INFO
"but it's,",,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, because, I mean, the general values that we're teaching",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school, I mean,",,INFO
"Is it the, do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the values they get from home.",,QUESTION
"Uh, well, the values, more or less at home and the T V, just a general,",,INFO
"I mean, learning is not a revered endeavor, really,",,INFO
"I mean, it's a lot more,",,INFO
"it's socially, well I won't say socially unacceptable,",,INFO
"but whereas like in, uh, a person that, uh, stud-,",,INFO
they put a lot more emphasis on athletics,,INFO
"and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society,",,INFO
and I think that carries over to school,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
a lot.,,INFO
So.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I, I, I think that the biggest problem is, uh, with the, uh, with the home environment being part of it.",,INFO
"You know, if,",,CAT
"I think too many parents expect, uh, the school to teach, uh, the moral aspects of, of things to the st-, to the kids and, you know, while we're not going to worry about, uh, teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that, you know, and then expect them to pick it up at school,",,INFO
"you're not going to do that, you know,",,INFO
"you're going to carry, carry with, carry to school, uh, out into the world, you know, what you learned at home,",,INFO
"and, uh",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, I think that that part of that showing up now, you know, with, with things because kids I think have probably less respect than for, for people than in, in other things, than we may have seen in the past, uh,",,INFO
"and part of it's the, the family, I think,",,INFO
"and part of it's, uh, the living conditions of certain people are subjected too,",,INFO
"drugs is a big problem now,",,INFO
"and I think that's, that's, that's another root problem.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"you know, I wonder if that's a root problem or not,",,INFO
"because I think about that a lot,",,INFO
"and it's just like, everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now,",,INFO
"but I wonder, you know,",,INFO
"do you get the,",,QUESTION
"oh, that's kind of side tracked,",,CAT
"but, uh, I just remember seeing on the news the other night, they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much better",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I thought, well, you know, of course they're doing better, and not so much when I was growing up,",,INFO
"Catholic schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools,",,INFO
"but, uh, they still had a, a better success rate, simply because they started with a lot better raw material.",,INFO
"I mean everybody that went to a Catholic school had, uh, at least the parents did, at least, had education as a priority",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
like you said,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it.,,INFO
"And I wonder if, not so much that, uh,",,INFO
"Well, I think it's, like you say, it's, it's the socioeconomic mix",,INFO
"there, you know, the, they're,",,CAT
"you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids who are basically, uh, that might be more well to-, well off, you know, going to a private Catholic school or whatever, uh,",,INFO
"and, and they're not all that way,",,INFO
"but, you know, some that are",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"um, that, they're, they're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city, uh, you know, public schools.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"this is interesting because in my mind I don't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment,",,INFO
"but, uh, this, this was actually inner city",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"people were sending,",,INFO
"I mean, just because their kids had the ability and the, and the drive to do, try and get an education, they didn't send him to a public school, you know,",,INFO
"like you said, you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, you know, in a lot of cases like that, where, you know, if kids are going to a public parochial school like that, it's, it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education. It shows, I think it shows that the parents have some, uh, desire for, for the kid to do, do well, you know,",,INFO
"and that may be passed on down to the kid as well,",,INFO
"and, uh, maybe they pick up on that.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And then from the other aspect, um, maybe the, uh, school itself has, has, has more emphasis on, uh, trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller, uh,",,INFO
"they may be able to, to give the resources that's needed to, uh, to do a good job.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I mean,",,CAT
"and what do you, what would you do to fix the school systems?",,QUESTION
"Uh, that's a tough question",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
how to fix the school system.,,INFO
"Uh, with, uh,",,CAT
"I would try to, I guess, to see about getting parents more involved, with, try to, to come up with more ways to do that. Uh, uh, uh, stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students, and, uh, more, more classes that I think that are,",,INFO
"and I think this is happening some around the country in terms of, um, morals, trying to teach the kinds of things that, that aren't getting taught at home, and, uh, and, and respect for other people.",,INFO
"Uh, I think that's a big part of it.",,INFO
"You know, people, you know,",,CAT
"if you don't care about property and people, you know, you're not going to care about, uh, about learning, I think.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know,",,INFO
you're not going to really care about yourself.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
That's what I was going to say.,,INFO
It's the chicken and the egg thing.,,INFO
"I wonder, a lot of times, you know, people, I mean, a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"vandalism wise,",,INFO
"and you get,",,CAT
"I mean, it's been a while since I been in high school.",,INFO
They're even in grade school when they do that.,,INFO
But I can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that.,,INFO
"But you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything, and take it out on the school.",,INFO
"Well, you know, and I,",,CAT
"that's not an ea-, but that's not an easy task, you know,",,INFO
"that's why I say, it's, it's a tough question what would you do,",,INFO
"because, you know, even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when, uh, when, when you're growing up in, you know, in a home which may be, uh, just the pits,",,INFO
"and uh, you don't have any, any kind of a good environment to live in, you know,",,INFO
"it's kind of hard to say, well, you need to take care of other people's stuff as well, when you're, when you barely have anything yourself.",,INFO
So.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I could see where that would be a problem,",,INFO
"and I think that's, I think it's ...",,INFO

"Okay,",,CAT
we're supposed to talk about vacations.,,INFO

"Oh, well, no northe-,",,CAT
"I'm from the north,",,INFO
"that's why I said we, in Kentucky, we,",,INFO

"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, it, it gets bad.",,INFO
"Well, you know what they've started doing is, is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"they've started putting them up at the top,",,INFO
"and that way it gets above, um, other cars on the road",,INFO
"Well, that's a good idea.",,INFO
"and, uh, it really does make a difference, although it, it settles, you know,",,INFO
"even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out, it still settles,",,INFO
"and, and, you know, if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road, that's, that's even more miserable.",,INFO

there is a,,INFO

that's a bad tangent to get on.,,INFO
What else has changed between the sixties and the eighties,,QUESTION
"Uh,",,CAT
and the nineties?,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"I think, uh, m-, in my situation,",,INFO
I have three children,,INFO
"and we're, uh, home schooling.",,INFO
"So, education, you know, things that relate t-, to education, um, are things that I think about a lot.",,INFO
"Um, I think that, and I think that involves social changes a lot.",,INFO
"Uh, for instance I think the schools are having more and more problems because of, uh, things that are happening socially in the world around them and in, in, t-, because of their parents",,INFO
"and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home, rather. More not than are. And children being put in day-care centers from very early,",,INFO
"and, and I think that a lot of these things that have been happening, such as the day-care centers and things, are having a big effect on the social changes.",,INFO
"Because of the way children are being raised, they're not learning the values they need to learn.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And they're not, um, th-, they don't have the self-esteem that they need to have",,INFO
"and they don't have the, um, a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and deal with the things in the world.",,INFO
"And, uh, I think we're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang, gang things that are happening",,INFO
"and, and, um",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"It seems, so that,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
that is a pretty big change.,,INFO
"It seems, even not just single parent families but with no guidance",,INFO
"but it seems like,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"some of these even ladies that, that'll work and have,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"a baby and then, you know, after two or three months,",,INFO
.,,CAT
go back to work.,,INFO

That's really sad.,,INFO
"I think that a lot of people,",,INFO
and they think they have to,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I think that if they really tried, they wouldn't have to.",,INFO
"And,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I think that if they didn't that, and it became more of the standard not to that, uh, I don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home. You",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"know? And have a more solid, uh, foundation for the kids.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean they're going to,",,INFO
"like you said, I mean, there's, they might be saving money,",,INFO
"I mean even if they had to pay more now, I mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
force two people to work. Even though,,INFO
"It's already,",,INFO
it's higher productivity is short-term.,,INFO
It already costs society much more because of it.,,INFO
"You know it,",,INFO
"trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those. You wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Um, there's,",,CAT
"and I think, uh, a lot of it is selfishness.",,INFO
People have become very selfish.,,INFO
They don't want to stay home with the kids,,INFO
"Y-, yeah",,CAT
or something like that.,,INFO
"There are a lot of two parent, um, situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do, you know.",,INFO
Oh rather than she needs the money,,INFO
"Rather than that,",,INFO
just she wants the,,INFO
she has to have the money particularly.,,INFO
stimulating environment,,INFO
"Or, maybe there's a small need for money",,INFO
"so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself, too",,INFO

"You know,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It's interesting how, w-, uh,",,INFO

completely,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
Huh.,,CAT
"And I think, uh, it's becoming, uh, more popular then it has been for a while, I think.",,INFO
Home schooling's always been around,,INFO
"but, uh, I can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools.",,INFO
"Um, and a lot of it is discipline problems.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"A lot of it is,",,INFO
and you can tell which kids have been in day-care centers.,,INFO
"It, it's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"That, um, they've been raised in a day-care center.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"That's pretty sad because, I mean, I don't know, something's got to change with the schools.",,INFO
"That's what it all boils down to in the end, usually anyway.",,INFO
"Well, I think it's going to,",,INFO
"When they're young,",,INFO
change in the homes before anything,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
changes anywhere else.,,INFO
"The home is the base,",,INFO
it's the basic unit.,,INFO
"And that's the, where it all starts",,INFO
and if we don't start making changes in the homes,,INFO
and maybe part of that is educating parents better.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And educating, uh, you know",,CAT
Changing people's expectations.,,INFO
"I know they do do some, they do have some classes in, um, high schools and things for kids to, uh, give them an idea of what family life is like and the, uh, you know, and, uh, that kind of thing",,INFO

No.,,CAT
"I mean, some nights it's just real, real quiet.",,INFO
So.,,CAT
I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part.,,INFO
"So we, I have sort of a captive audience,",,INFO

Right.,,CAT
"But, uh, of course I'm away from my other son those hours, too.",,INFO
But his dad's at home,,INFO

"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's true,",,G_G
yeah.,,CAT
Gives him a little bit of that individual time.,,INFO

"and they want to be able to spend, uh.",,INFO
That's right.,,G_G

Right.,,CAT
"then I think it, it is hard.",,INFO
"It's, um,",,CAT
"I think one of the nice things about holidays is that, you know, it does give you the opportunity to spend more time",,INFO
Slow down a little bit.,,INFO
"yeah, with family.",,INFO
"We have, we often go to Illinois",,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"for Christmas,",,INFO
"and we're not this year,",,INFO
"and it's just really nice because we can do, you know, the things you want to do.",,INFO
"You can do, uh, more than",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
than when you travel.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's right.,,INFO
"This is the first year we're staying home, too,",,INFO
"and, uh, I think it's going to be real quiet",,INFO
"but, uh, that's an opportunity to get out the games",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"See, we usually do that,",,INFO
"my, my kids even have already gotten out, um,",,INFO
my twelve year old got out the Legos,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
which of course he hasn't touched since last summer,,INFO
"Of co-, of course.",,CAT
"but, you know, but every now and then, I mean, he's got a lot of those technic, those hard kind,",,INFO
"you know, and he wants to be an engineer,",,INFO
so he still likes,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
all that kind of building stuff,,INFO
"and, um, we have the train,",,INFO
"and we haven't had that Lego train together for years,",,INFO
"and, um, so he sat down,",,INFO
"and I told him I really wanted him to build the train,",,INFO
"and we would put it under the tree, and that I would keep it together,",,INFO
I wouldn't take it apart,,INFO
Wouldn't take it apart after that.,,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
and every year I'd have the Lego train under the tree.,,INFO
That'd be kind of fun.,,G_G
"And, um, so he worked on that for the longest time, ever since school was out on Friday,",,INFO
"and, um, then his sixteen year old brother started helping, too, you know.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"you know, these are kind of things like during the normal rat race",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
those kinds of things never happen,,INFO
No,,CAT
but.,,CAT
no.,,CAT
"In fact in, I think if people would learn to turn off the T V -s",,INFO
and,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
I think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
and the communication,,INFO
"Which is,",,CAT
"that would take place in a family,",,INFO
usually people are not sitting in front of that.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"and there's always a few people in the family that, when they stare at it, you know, they're totally turned off to everything else.",,INFO
The rest of.,,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT
"and you can't communicate while you're doing that, right?",,QUESTION
No,,CAT
That's right.,,G_G
"Whereas, uh, I'm the type of person, I could not sit, well,",,INFO
"I shouldn't say I could not,",,CAT
but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
me too.,,INFO
doing something.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I don't watch very much of it at all, e-, to, to the extent that sometimes I feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that",,INFO
"Because they talk so much,",,INFO
"isn't that the,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"they talk about T V shows,",,INFO
"and I, huh,",,CAT
"you know, how can you watch that, you know",,INFO
"You're kind of like, what are you talking about",,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
"it's the best show on,",,INFO
I don't know.,,CAT
"You feel like you're a little bit out of it, don't you.",,QUESTION
.,,CAT
"They need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what's,",,INFO
,,
Go ahead,,COMMAND
"Uh, have you every been tested for a new job or anything?",,QUESTION
"Uh, no",,CAT
I haven't.,,INFO
"But, in my job, I'm a nurse, and we are allowed to be.",,INFO
"I mean, you know, this is the rules that they can do this anytime.",,INFO
"Uh, I don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested.",,INFO
"So it's just sort of, uh,",,CAT
"they can if they,",,CAT
They can if they choose to.,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"Have you, well wai-, have you had any experience with it at all?",,QUESTION
"Uh, not really",,CAT
but I've always worked on a university level,,INFO
but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So what do you think about that?,,QUESTION
"Uh, I don't, I don't think they're very accurate",,INFO
"because, I mean, I know their lifestyles changed p-, prior to the drug test",,INFO
and I know they changed afterwards.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
See I know of that too.,,INFO
"And I also know that things like antihistamines, Sudafeds, things like that, can really throw it off.",,INFO
And you cannot get a job because of it,,INFO
and they may not tell you the reason why. *,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I had a friend,",,INFO
it didn't cause her any problems with her job,,INFO
but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,INFO
"But what it was, was she had been u-, she had been, uh, in the jungle",,INFO
and it was some Malaria medication,,INFO
and she tested positive for that.,,INFO
"See, and so it really is a dangerous thing that way",,INFO
because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job,,INFO
and they weren't told why.,,INFO
"But a lot of people say the reason why, after you take a physical, will be because of the drug testing",,INFO
or they would tell you.,,INFO
Or this person never use any drugs.,,INFO
"See, I always,",,CAT
"I thought they got, you got called back if you tested positive, for more tests.",,INFO
"Uh, you should.",,INFO
Because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something.,,INFO
I have real mixed feelings about it.,,INFO
I don't know.,,INFO
"How, do you know how wrong they are?",,QUESTION
"Are they, I mean, is there a margin of error?",,QUESTION
The accuracy?,,CAT
I don't know.,,CAT
I don't know.,,INFO
"But, I know there are a lot of things that can influence them",,INFO
and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And if you could show that,",,INFO
"I, I interviewed for a job recently",,INFO
and I was taking Entex.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And my doctor gave me a prescription for it.,,INFO
"And he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive, you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you, you know.",,INFO
And it didn't come up that I needed to do it,,INFO
but this could happen to anybody,,INFO
"and if they would just say oh, this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
you know. Then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
So I don't know.,,CAT
"And I, I'm not so sure they are that needed.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I'm not,,INFO
"I mean, *",,CAT
sure either.,,INFO
"The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it, then they have the right to go ahead and prove it",,INFO
because they say they can spot check.,,INFO
"Ye-, *",,INFO
"if you're using it while at a job, I can see a problem.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But the occasional person, then it's almost like, it's almost an infringement of your privacy.",,INFO
"Well, it sort of is.",,INFO
"And this is it,",,CAT
"this,",,CAT
I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways.,,INFO
"You know, as a health professional, I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, so as a patient, I feel well, yeah, we probably should be protected.",,INFO
"But, on the other hand, there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too.",,INFO
So,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, I guess you sort of, you have to have trust some place along the way.",,INFO
You can't go around testing everybody for everything.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"So, I don't know.",,INFO
"And I, I think it could be used to hassle somebody.",,INFO
"If someone was out to get you, I think that a company or a boss could use this.",,INFO
"You know, they could keep on doing this to you or something, I guess.",,INFO
I can see where it could become a problem.,,INFO
"And it, it's like, it seems like now they have tests",,INFO
I guess they can test your hair,,INFO
and they can find out if you use drugs,,INFO
Really.,,CAT
up to several years ago.,,INFO
"Oh, wow! But *",,G_G
"So,",,CAT
maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. *,,INFO
I know.,,CAT
That's the other thing.,,CAT
"I mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on",,INFO
and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
There's a lot of things you do as a kid that,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
you wouldn't do as an adult,,INFO
but,,INFO
I think that's true.,,CAT
you can't say it was wrong at the time.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
So that probably wouldn't be too good either.,,INFO
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"well yes,",,CAT
we do have pollution in Houston,,INFO
"and it,",,CAT
How bad is it?,,QUESTION
Do you have smog like they do in California?,,QUESTION
"Well it, it",,CAT
"some,",,CAT
"I think it depends on, uh, you know, what the, ho-, the cloud cover",,INFO
"and like right now, it's, uh, it's kind of overcast, you know,",,INFO
"just, it's hot,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and the sun is trying, tries to shine through",,INFO
"but it's, it's holding in this, this pollution",,INFO
"and I,",,CAT
"It depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion, I take it.",,INFO
"I think so,",,CAT
"and, uh,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"and we have, uh, Pasadena, Texas which is sort of between here an, you know, heading toward Galveston,",,INFO
"I mean it's still part of, it's part of the Houston metroplex.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
What do you think is your primary cause of it.,,QUESTION
"Well, I think it's industry",,INFO
and I think it's cars.,,INFO
You do?,,QUESTION
You really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas?,,QUESTION
"I don't, I,",,CAT
"well maybe not,",,CAT
"but, it, it sure, it sure, se-,",,INFO
"you know, it,",,CAT
"I, I know that when I'm, when I'm behind a car",,INFO
"and, uh, sometimes, uh, I can really smell especially diesel and things like that,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, comes right into my air conditioner",,INFO
"and, you know, my head and my fa-,",,INFO
"I'm so stopped up right now,",,INFO
"Um,",,CAT
my goodness.,,G_G
"I don't know if it's, uh, if it's partly from what's blooming, you know, right now, pollen and stuff like that,",,INFO
"that's part of it,",,INFO
"but, um.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I think a lot of it's industrial.,,INFO
"I also think, uh, that, uh, there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles",,INFO
but it's mostly from older automobiles.,,INFO
"I don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting, uh, frankly.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I think that, uh, I think that, uh, uh,",,INFO
"if, uh,",,CAT
"I, I, I heard a story a while back",,INFO
"something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent, or, take all the cars off the road that have been, uh, manufactured say before nineteen seventy-five,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining.,,INFO
"You mean, uh, fifty percent pollution total",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"from that comes from,",,INFO
"From, from cars",,INFO
"that is, not, not total but just from cars,",,INFO
okay.,,CAT
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"So, that I think would be tremendous help.",,INFO
But I happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical,,INFO
"and it just keeps getting, uh, gives me good service",,INFO
and I don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
On the other hand I know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars I have.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
But I don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, uh, that may be part of the problem.",,INFO
"Als-,",,CAT
"Do you all have pollution in your co-, part of the country, uh, from industry?",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"oh, uh, yeah,",,CAT
"it's, it's, uh, pretty heavy up here I think",,INFO
"but I think it's mostly industrial, is what I really, uh, believe is the, the main problem.",,INFO
"And, and, uh,",,CAT
"and, uh, uh, people, uh, I don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should.",,INFO
"I, I we, we seem to have a high, uh, cancer rate up here in Maryland.",,INFO
"Really,",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and, uh,",,CAT
"like what ki-,",,CAT
any particular kind or just all kinds?,,QUESTION
"Well, for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant",,INFO
"and, uh, I think,",,CAT
"of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody,",,INFO
"but, uh, th-, this state was like the second,",,INFO
"my wife's a registered nurse,",,INFO
"and I think this state was like second this year from the top, in terms of, uh, cancer rate for just all kinds.",,INFO
And I can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution.,,INFO
"I just don't know exactly what it necessarily is,",,INFO
but I just can't believe it is.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"Now we have a lot of pollution being caused by cloruph-, uh, fluorocarbons which is the, like freon twelve and freon twenty-two.",,INFO
"They use freon twenty-two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners,,INFO
and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer, that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also,",,INFO
"and having all kinds of effects,",,INFO
and.,,CAT
"Well what can we do about the, the, the, the air conditioning problem?",,QUESTION
"Well they're working now,",,INFO
"I know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working, uh, feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and who ever does is going to make, uh, a mint.",,INFO
"Because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons, then, uh,",,INFO
"Is that also what's in, uh, hairsp-, aerosol?",,QUESTION
"Well they used to be,",,CAT
but they made them take it out of that.,,INFO
"Even, so, so the aerosol is still aerosol,",,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
but it doesn't have anything that's damaging.,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"they, they, they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
well that's good.,,INFO
and that was a move in the right direction.,,INFO
We are doing some things to try to correct the problem.,,INFO
But there are more things we could do,,INFO
"and getting rid of old cars, like I said is one way to help correct the problem.",,INFO
"Uh, uh, just trying to I think be careful, uh, with the way you handle garbage,",,INFO
"I notice in this state,",,INFO
"I don't know if you're doing it in Texas yet or not,",,INFO
"but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces, uh, you know, containers in,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"Here, they've just started, started doing that,",,INFO
"it's, it's, you know,",,CAT
"you're not, you don't have to,",,INFO
"but m-, you know,",,CAT
I know I am.,,INFO
"I save,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too.,,INFO
"But they, uh,",,CAT
"in one of the counties here, they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police.",,INFO
They have a lady that goes around like a meter maid,,INFO
and she spot checks people's trash.,,INFO
"No kidding,",,G_G
"really,",,CAT
oh.,,CAT
"And if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash,",,INFO
Is that right.,,QUESTION
they'll fine you fifty bucks I think the first time and two fifty the second time.,,INFO
"Well, we need to do something,",,INFO
we need to get serious about it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you,",,CAT
"right,",,CAT
"you've got to get people to see i-,",,INFO
"and surprisingly enough just handling of trash, uh, can cut pollution, uh, from, uh, uh, from just throwing it in a dump, or, or, or, where ever else they used to do with it, maybe used to burn it.",,INFO
They've stopped that up here too.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But that, that will cut pollution too.",,INFO
"Because you get a lot of out gassing from these things, I think, decaying and tr-, and trying to,",,INFO
"for instance cans and bottles, they never go away at all.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But on, on the other hand, I don't guess they're polluting.",,INFO
"But plastic containers and the like, uh, they may be,",,INFO
I'm not sure of that.,,INFO
"How much does, uh, planting more trees and things like that help?",,QUESTION
Oh I think that's very important to do.,,INFO
too.,,CAT
"I, I really think that, uh, trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very, very important thing.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, that can help to cut pollution, I guess some.",,INFO
"I, I don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air.",,INFO
"I would hope that they would help some, though.",,INFO
That's for sure.,,INFO
"I think, uh, it seems like there was something going on, around here, that, you know,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out, you know, like in the middle of the night, they would go ahead and do it anyway.",,INFO
I think they got caught.,,INFO
Oh good.,,G_G
"But I wonder how much of that kind of stuff, you know, goes on.",,INFO
"Well that, uh, that I think may go on a lot",,INFO
"and the primary reason I think it may go on a lot is just as you said, somebody happened to stay up late at night or something.",,INFO
"I don't think we have a adequate policing, uh, particularly on industry.",,INFO
"Uh, we have good policing, at least in this state and, and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too, of car pollutants",,INFO
"because we have to go down, uh, once a year here in Maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content.",,INFO
"Uh, we have to, uh, we have to have a state inspection every year.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Do you all have that?,,QUESTION
"Uh, no,",,CAT
"we don't have a state inspection,",,INFO
"So,",,CAT
"which I,",,CAT
"I don-,",,CAT
"I would assu-,",,CAT
but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state.,,INFO
"So I'm assu-, I'm assuming that, you know, they check, they check everything for safety",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"uh, that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities.",,INFO
"But in this state we have to, uh, pay eight dollars and a half and go to a, an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are, have been made starting in nineteen seventy-three.",,INFO
"But that's all they check for,",,QUESTION
"they don't check how good,",,QUESTION
if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough.,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
we don't have inspections like that.,,INFO
"Now, I'm in Maryland,",,INFO
"in Virginia they check that every two years, I think.",,INFO
"We do that ev-, every year.",,INFO
"And I think that's a good idea too,",,INFO
"not, no-, not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily,",,INFO
but I think it's a good idea.,,INFO
"The emission check, though, is required in Maryland",,INFO
"and it's also required in Virginia, uh, a sister state to, to this one.",,INFO
"And that's, that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants.",,INFO
"Well I'll have to check,",,INFO
"I'm not sure if, if our state inspection ever-,",,INFO
"once a year has to do, you know,",,INFO
"if they check the, uh,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"well if they don't I would imagine in time they'll get a law with. i-, get around to it,",,INFO
"and if they don't then that's something I would certainly, uh, uh, suggest you be willing to uh, uh, be for in terms of, uh,",,INFO
"Oh, I would",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"I'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or, or, or anything.",,INFO
"Oh yeah,",,CAT
"I, I agree.",,CAT
Now that's another area we haven't even discussed,,INFO
"and that is water pollution and various of the other types of, uh, of, uh, like food pollution.",,INFO
"I mean you, you hardly ever hear, hear anybody say anything about food pollution.",,INFO
"But I think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries,",,INFO
"so, uh, hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of, uh, pollutants in our food.",,INFO
"But water pollution, uh,",,CAT
"I've worried, especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I know a lot more people are going to bottled water.,,INFO
Well,,CAT
and that's not necessarily the answer either,,INFO
because they've found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"tap,",,CAT
yeah,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"but a lot of these, uh,",,CAT
some of this,,CAT
"well, you know, a lot of people have well water,",,INFO
in fact in this area too,,INFO
"and, an, you know,",,CAT
"and, uh,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're, what you're drinking",,INFO
"and I, I know a lot of people, you know, have that",,INFO
"and, you know, you have to wonder if that, you know could have an adverse affect on them too,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"if they don't, i-, they don't get it checked.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course, have it checked",,INFO
"because it seems, uh,",,INFO
"when I was a kid growing up down south, uh, I used to go out in the country where my grandparents were",,INFO
"and we had a well,",,INFO
"it was one of those draws that,",,INFO
"I forget what you call those things,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, and that was some of the best tasting water,",,INFO
"I mean, I can still to this day taste that water.",,INFO
"When we were,",,CAT
"when I was growing up I lived in Huntsville, Alabama,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and their water supply came from, uh, spring.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And it was like ice cold, spring water",,INFO
"and I guess parts of the, the city still ha-, you know, get that,",,INFO
"but, uh, that was, that was really wonderful.",,INFO
"Oh, I bet it was.",,G_G
"It was really, really good.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"the-,",,CAT
"once it's been filtered an if it's a deep enough well, filtered through all the earth and everything I think that, uh,",,INFO
it depends of course where you are.,,INFO
"A good well, though, I think is very healthy ...",,INFO
,,
"Uh, with regard to, uh, to jury trials. I, you know, I, I really feel as though, uh, jury trials are, are, uh, whatever system has been, been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the, the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the, the jurisprudence is, you know, based on, on, uh, you know, on accumulated n-, body of law.",,INFO
"And if, if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they, they start, they could start going back and digging up all these cases that, uh, that would be handled differently were",,INFO
.,,CAT
they judged by today's standards.,,INFO
"So I, I really don't think it, they can really do much of anything to change it.",,INFO
What do you think?,,QUESTION
"Uh, I, I don't think so.",,INFO
"Possibly in the jury selection would be the only,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"just for example, what we're seeing in California I guess.",,INFO

"I'm not a member of the N R A although my,",,INFO
.,,CAT
father is.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT

Yeah.,,CAT
"they're sitting there on number ten,",,INFO
"they're saying absolutely no gun control,",,INFO
.,,CAT
we don't even want to think about it,,INFO
"and, and I think that's a dumb,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
situation.,,INFO
"Because there has got to be some kind of background check to see,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose, you know, if, if you're going to hunt with it,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
or if you're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
That's true.,,CAT
It's not a big deal for them to go.,,INFO
"If they're can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket, you know, I mean, they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of psychiatric record,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT

That's true.,,CAT
any of that kind of stuff.,,INFO

Right.,,CAT
"But,",,CAT
"If the gun shop owner does it,",,INFO

"you know, but,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
but he has to go out and do it.,,INFO
"That's true, I think,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"if, and if it's a private sale, of course, then there's nothing.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, see that's my only problem with, uh,",,INFO
"making you, um,",,CAT
"you know, get the check and everything is, is, I guess bad guys, if you want to call them bad guys,",,INFO
they are going to get a gun no matter what.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"They're not,",,CAT
"I don't think they're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check,",,INFO
"I think they're going to go out and find it someway, individual sale or something like that.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"But, but maybe we'll prevent a few John Hinckleys.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I hope.,,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
"You know, I, I,",,CAT
"that, that's the kind of people,",,INFO
"like I say, I don't think the guy who's going to rob a Seven Eleven, is going to rob a Seven Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife, baseball bat,",,INFO
"Knife,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
"or, you know, whatever,",,INFO
He's going to do what he wants to do.,,INFO
"but, you know,",,CAT
That's true.,,CAT
"I, I just think it makes honest people more honest",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
Yeah.,,INFO
"And, and the people who want it, it's not that big a deal, like I say, to wait.",,INFO
Right .,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"And, if you have to have it in a hurry, something's wrong",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it makes you wonder,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"what they need it for all of a sudden here. Um,",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
That's right.,,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
"Well, I'm married to a policeman,",,INFO
"so we, we talk about this a lot",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I imagine his, his opinion is a little bit towards the one there,",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
on the,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
scale of one to ten he needs some more.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I was watching a,",,INFO
"Gosh,",,G_G
"if I was a cop I would be,",,INFO
worried about that.,,INFO
"Too many people have too many, too much access.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
they do.,,CAT
They do.,,CAT
"and, I guess I think, the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is, there should be some law against the types of gu-,",,INFO
"I mean,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"some of these Saturday night specials that these companies put out,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"that are , pie-, I mean, they're are",,INFO
basically it says here buy me and go rob a seven eleven,,INFO
right,,CAT
or even even the um the little um toy guns look real.,,INFO
I mean,,CAT
yes,,CAT
they that's really gotten bad,,INFO
I've heard so much about that on TV,,INFO
and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one.,,INFO
Or your child,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
accidently.,,INFO
"If your child is old enough,",,INFO
"I mean, there are a lot of kids who when they're ten look like they're twelve,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"or fourteen or, and, and, especially some of the minority children. Whether,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know a racist or not,",,INFO
that's the truth.,,INFO
"And, And if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands",,INFO
"and a cop comes up,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"I mean, you can't blame them.",,INFO
It looks,,INFO
"You can't ,",,INFO
like they've got a weapon.,,INFO
Jeez and you can't take the chances.,,INFO
"That's right,",,CAT
Because there's been kids that age who have killed people.,,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
"And, you know, you know, there was a law in, I think it's in Oregon, where they've now made all toy guns,",,INFO
they're making them neon colors.,,INFO
Right,,CAT
"and I think, that's a good idea.",,INFO
"You know like, yeah,",,CAT
and the kids don't care.,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
My kid didn't care.,,INFO
I know.,,CAT
He picks up a stick and goes bang.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
It doesn't make any difference to him.,,INFO
A gun is a gun to them.,,INFO
Yeah .,,CAT
They can play with anything and make it a gun.,,INFO
That's exactly right.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"so you like to do,",,CAT
"I think they ought to do that with toy guns,",,INFO
they ought to make them very reasonably,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
do something outrageous to them.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Exactly.,,CAT
"You know, so that they're not very distinguishable from a real gun.",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
That's a good idea.,,G_G
"I was, uh, watching T V yesterday",,INFO
"and there is a town in Georgia,",,INFO
"and it's the law that you have a gun,",,INFO
"every adult, you know, uh, is able to carry a gun,",,INFO
"and,",,INFO
"That's kind of ,",,INFO
and they encourage it.,,INFO
They encourage it?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, the police love it.",,INFO
Which really surprised me,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"and, and, I think, and that's what they were going after, uh, they went to interview this town,",,INFO
"I mean it's a little dinky town,",,INFO
they went to interview them about the gun control laws,,INFO
"and, uh, the police said, all the people said, that's fine we could care less.",,INFO
"You know, we're all honest, and everything like,",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"that,",,INFO
"we, we all carry them,",,INFO
"but we, we don't mind being checked.",,INFO
"And, uh, and I think it kind of took that uh, neatness away from it, you know,",,INFO
"like, well heck, everybody's got one, you know",,INFO
"and,",,INFO
I don't know.,,CAT
"I,",,CAT
"So, it was, it was quite unusual to see the people in that town.",,INFO
That's kind of an odd thing.,,G_G
"I don't know,",,CAT
I have a gun,,INFO
"and, uh, my folks have always had.",,INFO
I learned to shoot when I was real little.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I think that's a lot of it too, is that people need to teach their kids,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"what not to, what to do and what not to do.",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
"Because I started shooting, my Dad started letting me shoot like a little air B B gun,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
when I was probably five or six years old.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, you know, it was,",,CAT
this is how you hold,,INFO

"and you don't ever touch it unless I'm here,",,INFO
and you don't,,INFO
That's what we're doing.,,INFO
"you don't point it at people,",,INFO
"and then they had,",,CAT
"then they went to the Texas Parks and Recreation, I guess,",,INFO
"but anyway the s-, hunter safety program,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
that you have to do now.,,INFO
I think it started in about nineteen seventy.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"If you want, if you want to go deer hunting",,INFO
"and your birthday's after nineteen something,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"fifty-five or something, then you have to attend one of these hunter safety courses",,INFO
"Well, that's neat.",,G_G
or you can't get a deer license.,,INFO
"Well, that's real neat.",,G_G
"And it, and it, it's basic stuff,",,INFO
"it's like, it's don't, you know, when you're climbing over a barbed wire fence, don't point, lean your gun against it, you know,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and then you crawl over it,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and shoot yourself.,,INFO
"And, uh,",,INFO
"Well, that's real good.",,G_G
those things happen.,,INFO
"It, it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"And they usually are real basic,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
put the safety on the gun.,,INFO
common sense things.,,INFO
"Don't assume, always assume it's loaded.",,INFO
"That's, that's got to be the most common thing that people,",,INFO
I know,,CAT
and people don't want to believe that.,,INFO

"if you make it where it's not something,",,INFO
to be feared,,INFO
"Curious,",,INFO

not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared about.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT

"and I got it because my husband used to travel, and be out,",,INFO
he was out of the country at one time for three months.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"And, I was like, I live in a nice neighborhood,",,INFO
"but still,",,CAT
still,,CAT
"and then I've got it so far,",,INFO
"sometimes I think, I wonder if I, I'm not about to load it because I, you know, I assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it's in a case,",,INFO
"and it's, you know, it's put up",,INFO
"and it's away and all that,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"but, I don't want to take the chance",,INFO
"and, I think, if somebody ever does break in,",,INFO
He's got to go to a lot of trouble.,,INFO
"it's going to take me a year to find the shells,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and then get it,",,INFO
"hold on,",,INFO
hold on,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"He's in here somewhere,",,INFO
I know he is.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I know how to use one.",,INFO
"We, we go hunting every once in a while",,INFO
and he showed me how to use his guns,,INFO
and I really enjoy it,,INFO
"but, boy if someone did break in, I don't, I don't know that I could or would even grab it",,INFO
"I know,",,CAT
"I, I used to think about that,",,INFO
"it was a lot easier when I was, when I was single,",,INFO
it was one thing,,INFO
"and when I was just married with no kids,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That's true.,,CAT
"when it was just me, it was an easy decision.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It was like, you, you come after me, you're going to get it.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"and now there's so many other things, where are the kids, what are they doing,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, where is this person coming in from,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"uh, you've got,",,CAT
"and, and, if, if you manage to get it out",,CAT
"and then, you know, what, how can you even afford to, to think about what, what you're going to do because you don't know where your kids are,",,INFO
True.,,G_G
at the same time.,,INFO
"True,",,G_G
"well we, we have dogs",,INFO
Ugh.,,CAT
"that are pretty, you know, very protective, you know",,INFO
"We feel if they make enough noise that,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
if they're stupid enough to come through then,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It, it,",,CAT
"we have two big dogs in the backyard,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and always kind of thought that too, kind of an extra buffer.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"They've got to be pretty stupid,",,INFO
"and, and most people that, uh, break in or whatever, go to houses without the dogs,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
luckily.,,INFO
"Anything, that the,",,CAT
"well any, any advantage that they can take.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, that's one of them",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Unfortunately,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Well,",,CAT
Guess it makes it worth the dog food over the years,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Really does.,,CAT
"Well, do you think we've,",,G_G
"Yeah,",,G_G
"I, I think that's about all I can,",,G_G
"Me too, on gun control.",,G_G
"We, we're in pretty good agreement actually on it.",,G_G
Yeah.,,G_G
I think we are.,,G_G
"It would be an interesting, it would be even more interesting you, you to be some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum.",,G_G
Right.,,G_G
Right.,,G_G
I'm glad you're not,,G_G
Me too.,,G_G
I'm glad to find there's another reasonable person in Garland.,,G_G
Okay.,,G_G
Well good!,,G_G
"Well, it's been nice talking to you.",,G_G
"You too,",,G_G
thanks.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
Okay.,,CAT
All right.,,CAT
Capital punishment.,,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
what's your views on it?,,QUESTION
"Um, for myself, I'm personally against it,",,INFO
"but we seem to have a duality of, in this country where most states in theory have it, but, but, but do not use it.",,INFO
Correct.,,CAT
"Okay,",,CAT
"well, I'm for it.",,INFO
"I think there are certain crimes that definitely, uh, call for it.",,INFO
"I, I feel like that child molestation and murder",,INFO
I don't see any sense in someone living that does things like that.,,INFO
"I, I don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way,",,INFO
"and of course Texas has it, but they very seldom, you know, put it into effect.",,INFO
"So instead all of our prisons are full of people on, you know",,INFO
"Okay, well,",,CAT
a lot of people on death row.,,INFO
"Uh, Texas uses it as, about as much as any other state.",,INFO
"Well, uh, yeah",,CAT
"Texas is a big state,",,INFO
which is not very often.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Um, here in Maryland to the capital punishment law,",,CAT
"people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment, but no one, no one has, actually has the sentence carried out.",,INFO
"Uh, I'd certainly,",,CAT
"What do they do, just keep them on death row",,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I think so.,,INFO
for the rest of their life.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I, uh,",,CAT
or affair number,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, in fact, I think that, it, it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available,",,INFO
"the sentence of life without possibility of parole, uh, has become a common one, and is being, being used much more.",,INFO
Do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here?,,QUESTION
"Uh, I don't know the exact numbers,",,INFO
"but, but yes,",,CAT
prisons are overcrowded.,,INFO
"I know that we have, you know,",,INFO
"really in fact they're, they're releasing people, uh, that are in there for, you know, not major crimes, but, uh robberies and assault and things like that,",,INFO
"and, because they don't have room, which then they're coming back on the streets and of course, doing it again,",,INFO
"and um, you know, so we're having problems in, in that way,",,INFO
"and I know that there are some cases that, uh, you know, capital punishment does not fit the crime,",,INFO
"and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types, um, but I have to say that I'm honestly for it",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"uh, almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.",,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
"you're, you're certainly in the majority",,INFO
.,,CAT
"uh, at least in this country.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"Uh, we are, I guess, the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment.",,INFO
"I know they use it very, um,",,CAT
"they do not have it in Europe, as I understand.",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
at least not in Western Europe.,,INFO
Probably not in Eastern Europe these days either.,,INFO
"Um, there are many reasons for it,",,INFO
"but they, they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"you wonder what their, you know, how they manage to do that.",,INFO
"Well, in part it's, uh, it's the nature of societies, perhaps more homogenous society, in many cases, uh,",,INFO
"arguably, if",,CAT
"arguably is because of, of, uh, of, uh, welfare state benefits.",,INFO
"Though I tend to be, we tend to be skeptical.",,INFO
"Well, England has, uh, don't they have a large, fairly large welfare?",,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
"oh there's no question that, that they, that, uh, you know, they have, you know, all kinds of cradle to grave, uh, programs, welfare programs providing for everyone some way.",,INFO
"I, I, I,",,CAT
however the question is is that making the difference.,,QUESTION
"Oh, I, I don't know.",,CAT
But we have a lot of welfare programs,,INFO
and,,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
"if both do and they tend to have less crime, you wonder if that has anything to do with it then,",,INFO
"you know, or is it,",,CAT
"in our society, people are brought up over here thinking that, you know, everybody owes them something.",,INFO
"Um, I think, I think that idea is even, even more common in Western Europe.",,INFO
"Oh, do you?",,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well, that's interesting.",,G_G
"I would not have, I would not have said that.",,INFO
I would have said that it was more prevalent here in the United States.,,INFO
That's an interesting theory.,,INFO
"I'm not that familiar, you know,",,INFO
I've only been over there a couple of times,,INFO
and I'm not that familiar,,INFO
"Me, too.",,INFO
"with, that,",,INFO
"all I know is that, for instance we were in Germany in, uh,",,INFO
,,
"Gun control seems to be a rather, uh, timely topic, with all that's going on legislation wise.",,INFO
Yes,,CAT
"And, uh, interesting scale that they assigned it, uh, the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free",,INFO
"I'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle, I guess.",,INFO
don't mind regulating guns,,INFO
and I would certainly call for a ban on certain types.,,INFO
"Now wisdom as to which types, that's going to be a debate forever, I would assume.",,INFO
"Uh, the method controlling it, well that's all into how much money you want to put into controls.",,INFO
"Uh, one point that was made in the House hearings",,INFO
or,,CAT
"the representative stood up and said, you know, we can check a guy's credit card instantly,",,INFO
"but, uh, we don't want to check his background,",,INFO
and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"uh,",,CAT
"but there still, technology exists check it if they want.",,INFO
"So, kind of a,",,CAT
I guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that.,,INFO
And then you've got the group of people that decide that no particular reason to have them at all,,INFO
and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it,,INFO
"and I guess I would fall more in realm that I like the sport issue of it,",,INFO
"but could give it up without too much trouble,",,INFO
not the world's most pleasurable thing,,INFO
"and it costs a bit to do it,",,INFO
Yes,,CAT
"uh, finding ranges and things like that.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, I have shot a variety of guns for a number of years,",,INFO
but it's just not like golf or whatever.,,INFO
I mean there are other things that you could go do.,,INFO
"So, uh, don't see joy of shooting that much of a driving factor.",,INFO
"I think that society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I don't even keep the gun in our house,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"so I don't have that problem,",,INFO
"but, uh,",,CAT
"it's a hard, hard topic, I guess.",,INFO
"A lot of people have a hard issue, a lot of hard feelings about it.",,INFO
"They do,",,CAT
and can get them on either side,,INFO
"and just like you say,",,INFO
"uh, well I'd have to place myself, uh, probably seven or eight",,INFO
"because,",,CAT
"or not,",,CAT
"onto no control,",,INFO
"I'm sorry, excuse me, that,",,G_G
"uh, two or three.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I was going the wrong direction.,,INFO
"Uh, because of, we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,G_G
because they had a gun in the house,,INFO
"and the father kept the bullets in a separate place,",,INFO
"but the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to,",,INFO
"uh, he knew where places were, loaded the gun",,INFO
and they were playing cowboys and Indians,,INFO
and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes.,,INFO
Boy.,,CAT
"So, uh,",,CAT
"I mean it,",,INFO
it destroyed two families,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"uh, in just that instant",,INFO
"and, and say that they need it for protection, uh,",,INFO
"having worked at one time in Baltimore,",,INFO
"or,",,CAT
"I don't know if you're in the big city,",,INFO
Dallas.,,INFO
"are you,",,QUESTION
Dallas?,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That's a big city,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, then you know that, uh, uh,",,CAT
"if you live anywhere real close that, uh,",,INFO
"the safety is, uh,",,CAT
"some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and, you know.",,INFO
"But, uh, uh, we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up.",,INFO
"Uh, I, uh,",,CAT
"once, uh, uh, knew a fellow that had, had been a policeman",,INFO
"and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber, he's going to assume that you know how to use it well,",,INFO
"and he's going to, you know, try to shoot first.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, so, you know, if he's got one.",,INFO
"Uh, and if not,",,INFO
"uh, then usually they, uh,",,INFO
"if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you,",,INFO
"I mean, you know",,CAT
Right.,,CAT
.,,INFO
"he said that was better not to have,",,INFO
"especially myself, now I'm a widow,",,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
"when my handicapped son not at home, I'm by myself,",,INFO
"but, uh, there's,",,CAT
"I still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's really uh, playing Russian Roulette if you do",,INFO
"Uh,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
About the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that person was coming your way.,,INFO
"Once you're surprised, it's too late.",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"And, and the rare,",,CAT
That's right.,,CAT
"circum-,",,INFO
"you know, the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and had time to do anything about it.,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"And, I don't have that problem,",,INFO
as I don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one.,,INFO
"uh, N R As, uh, claim that the, uh, the constitutional, the right to bear arms and that whole statement, uh,",,INFO
"it's hard to know the original intent,",,INFO
"but don't see it as that, that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that, uh, yeah, it's the right to, to arm a militia as opposed to just the general public.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And earn a right,",,INFO
"not just a privilege as it were if you're going to serve in the militia,",,INFO
"then you have a right to have that arm,",,INFO
"but, uh,",,CAT
That's right.,,CAT
"you know, there's all sorts of arguments there",,INFO
I know,,CAT
"but, I don't even want to worry about what the original intent was,",,INFO
No.,,CAT
they didn't have this problem back then,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"That,",,CAT
"So, we change our rights with our social status.",,INFO
"That's, that's right,",,INFO
that's right.,,CAT
They're man given rights,,INFO
"and they can be taken away by a man,",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"uh, the people that hide behind that, I don't worry about.",,INFO
They can go live in another country if they want.,,INFO
"Well, yeah,",,CAT
"that's how I feel, too.",,INFO
"I know, well,",,INFO
"here where I work, uh, we have gun club.",,INFO
"And, of course, those people are very avid.",,INFO
"They, you know,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"they say there should be no ban,",,INFO
"that it's not,",,CAT
"but I can't see why any, uh, o-, on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, you know, when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide,",,INFO
"but there are a few guns that, uh, just are not, uh, sport,",,INFO
"or, I mean,",,CAT
I don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So, uh, think they should have at least some control over, over those things.",,INFO
"Uh, and when you were speaking about how they can check up, you know, on credit cards,",,INFO
"well, understand about the privacy act and everything,",,INFO
but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not.,,QUESTION
"That, to me, would not be an unreasonable thing.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And if they do,",,INFO
"course the argument with the people in the gun club, uh, is that, uh, well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And so, it's not going to be that they're buying them.",,INFO
"Course, some of them do.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So it, it is a hard question",,INFO
"Tends to, tends to strap only the legitimate people.",,INFO
Most regulation does,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"oh, yeah.",,CAT
"and, most,",,CAT
"it's very difficult to, uh, legislate, uh, crooks or",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"so it's,",,CAT
"well, this may be a never ending topic.",,INFO
"I got a couple of calls waiting on me,",,INFO
so I'd better let you go.,,G_G
"Okay,",,G_G
well thanks for talking.,,G_G
"Okay, bye.",,G_G
Bye-bye now.,,G_G
,,
"Well, we, in, in, in our family, have been pretty remiss in trying to, uh, you know, keep track of, uh, daily finances.",,INFO
"Uh, the, uh, way back, what, twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer, I did what everybody else does, which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks, and, you know, checkbooks and all this kind of thing",,INFO
and we kept that going for about a month,,INFO
and it became so onerous that we gave up on it,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That sounds about right,,G_G
"You know, so, uh, the only thing we're, you know, that we do now is, uh, I keep a, a little spread sheet of, uh, what I call the net worth calculation which is just the, the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth.",,INFO
"Uh, and I only update that, oh I don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. Every three months. Just, basically when the statements come in.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know. Just to see whether or not we're falling, you know, getting ahead, falling behind or staying even or what.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, that's really about, you know, the extent of, uh, of the kind of, uh, financial score keeping that we're doing.",,INFO
Uh,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Well it's kind of difficult for me. Because right now, uh, like most teachers, I'm laid off",,INFO
and,,CAT
Huh.,,CAT
"Oh dear, that's terrible.",,G_G
"so, um, I spend most, you know,",,INFO
I substitute a lot.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So it's a lot, it's very hard on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not, to try to keep track of finances.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, but I know how much I have to bring in a month",,INFO
And that's about it.,,INFO
That's about as far as we go.,,INFO
"And then anything extra is, you know, more or less split up between all of us.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And just thrown in the kitty, more or less, for a rainy day",,INFO
"Oh, I see.",,CAT
"Are you, are you married?",,QUESTION
"Are you living with a bunch of, with, with people that you're sharing expenses?",,QUESTION
"Uh, no.",,CAT
I'm a single mother.,,INFO
I have three children.,,INFO
"Oh, I see,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, uh, right now, we're on, we get f-, you know, aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it.",,INFO
And my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support,,INFO
Oh dear.,,G_G
So right now I know what I'm getting from the state,,INFO
"and, uh, I have to balance, more or less, what I get from the state with my bills and, uh, you know, try to work as many days as possible.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Any time they call me in.,,INFO
But I still have to figure out.,,INFO
"If I work too many days, then I lose all my state aid",,INFO
and if I don't work enough days then I don't get enough to meet the bills,,INFO
and it's like a juggling act every single month.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Like this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in,,INFO
but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation.,,INFO
I see.,,CAT
"So, you know, the four days before, they only have a four day week",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in,,INFO
"A-, oh, I see.",,CAT
They don't like to be absent before a vacation.,,INFO
"Oh, sure.",,CAT
"But we're shopping around as far as, well I'm shopping around as far as trying to get, uh, that's why I'm doing this, to get some extra money.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts.",,INFO
My kids are in Boy Scouts,,INFO
so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts,,INFO
because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me.,,INFO
So it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit.,,INFO
"But, you know, we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul.",,INFO
"I guess we're in the situation that a lot of am-, middle-class Americans are in.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you're the first, you know, uh,",,INFO
my next door neighbor just lost his job.,,INFO
"Oh, my Lord.",,G_G
"In a, you know, one of these, uh,",,INFO
"his company went broke. I mean went, you know, bankrupt.",,INFO
"Actually, it was a subsidiary of a, of an outfit called U S Shoe or something.",,INFO
"I-, i-, it was a computer subsidiary.",,INFO
I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company.,,INFO
Really.,,CAT
"But, uh, you know, they just folded it up and, uh, uh, told him to,",,INFO
they took the top management and gave them jobs,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"with the, with the corporate, uh, at the corporate front office",,INFO
and everybody else was sent packing.,,INFO
Oh,,CAT
"Uh, hang on one second",,COMMAND
I've got,,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"uh, somebody was knocking on my door here.",,INFO
"Uh, it sounds like, in a certain sense, at least at the present,",,INFO
"I mean, it sounds, sounds terrible to say,",,CAT
"but at the present stage, you probably are even more in the market for a, a budgetary thing than, than most people probably ar-, might be.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"In terms of keeping, keeping score of input and output.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Definitely.,,CAT
"Do you have, do you have a computer at home",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Uh, yes",,CAT
we do.,,INFO
And we try,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"to,",,INFO
"you know, I keep track of every penny.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, more or less, enter it in.",,INFO
Every single day I'm at the computer.,,INFO
I see.,,CAT
"And, it's like, okay, what do we have left,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"what do we have to pay, what",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"have we paid this month. What hasn't come in yet, you know",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Have you, do you use a standard, uh, a standard spread sheet",,QUESTION
"or I mean,",,CAT

"Okay,",,CAT
sorry.,,G_G
"Wow,",,G_G
that's okay,,CAT
"So, tell me about your home.",,COMMAND

It's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other.,,INFO

"It's, uh, an older home,",,INFO
"it's not new,",,INFO
"I like it though,",,INFO
it's big.,,INFO
"Oh really,",,CAT
what kind of square footage?,,QUESTION
"Oh, I wouldn't know,",,CAT
"I measured it one time,",,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"because I was, uh, we had saw some termites",,INFO
and we thought about getting it sprayed.,,INFO
"I think it was like,",,INFO
"I can't remember,",,INFO
I'm sorry,,G_G
.,,CAT
"That's okay,",,CAT
that's okay.,,CAT
"It's big enough for us, though.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
We kind of need maybe one more room.,,INFO
We've got two children.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
okay.,,CAT
"So where do you live at,",,QUESTION
"I mean wha-, what part of town. In here in Denison.",,QUESTION

up here then,,INFO

I'm really from Kentucky.,,INFO

We're busting out walls and things like that.,,INFO
That's what I want to do.,,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And so, we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it. And then shuffle the rooms around a little bit.",,INFO
That's kind of like what we'd like to do.,,INFO
We just had a baby a couple months ago,,INFO
"and we've got a den,",,INFO
it's more or less a spare room.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"We rarely go in there, except for to play chess.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
We want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter,,INFO
"and, uh, we need the one extra room.",,INFO
"Like, like you said, our rooms are too s-, the bedrooms are too small,",,INFO
"the living room and kitchen are huge,",,INFO

"Well, we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house.",,INFO
"It,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I'd hate to clean these windows,",,INFO
I really would.,,INFO
I figured I'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean.,,INFO
Ours are the double pane,,INFO
"and you can't really clean them on the inside, you know.",,INFO
"Ours are those too,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
You must live in an older home too then.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"I do,",,INFO
"the house is about, um, I'd say almost thirty years old.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So it's not a new home,",,INFO
"it's, it's seen some wear and tear.",,INFO
Ours has too.,,INFO
You know.,,INFO
"When we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and he did it hisself,",,INFO
"so most of that, by now, is falling apart.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"You know, well I mean, it's not just horrible,",,INFO
"but like this tile's come loose off the wall,",,INFO
the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile,,INFO
and I don't like that at all.,,INFO
"Um, that is awful.",,G_G
"With that, uh, the great big tiles, square tiles like, that you put on the floor,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
he did it in that?,,QUESTION
"the, the huge one.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
instead of wallpaper.,,INFO
"I wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles,",,INFO
"for that you put,",,INFO
"The normal tiles,",,INFO
right.,,CAT
right,,CAT
"that you put around a bathtub,",,INFO
that would be prettier.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
But this looks like floor covering on the wall.,,INFO
It just doesn't look good.,,INFO
"Oh, and also they're very heavy",,INFO
and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
there's one big one that has come off,,INFO
"and short of putting nails through it, we can't get it back on,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
Um.,,CAT
And he rewired the house,,INFO
"and it's shorting out here and there,",,INFO
and,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Oh, wow,",,G_G
"I,",,CAT
"that's one of the things we've been fortunate with, is our, uh, wiring is okay.",,INFO
"We don't have a, we don't have enough power,",,INFO
"um, or our breakers aren't, aren't powerful enough to take, to, to really help with the load in the house.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean we need to redo some, rewiring ourselves",,INFO
but our plumbing is awful.,,INFO
"There is n-, there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work,",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house,",,INFO
"so if something breaks, we have to shut it off from the main, in the street,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"and, oh, it's, it can be really bizarre.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And we never know where it's going to flood.,,INFO
We've got power surges on the west side of our house.,,INFO
We've got our stereo hooked up.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well that,",,CAT
the power makes it run.,,INFO
"It's never ran,",,INFO
"it's always ran just fine, the clock and stuff.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But it runs about ten minutes fast, except for about a month, for about a month the, the clock ran normal.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"And then the power went off again,",,INFO
lightning or something knocked it out,,INFO
and we hooked it back up,,INFO
and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
But on the east side of the house it runs fine.,,INFO
"Oh boy, you do have a strange wiring problem there.",,G_G
"He put new wiring in,",,INFO
"it's all new wiring up in the attic,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT

"he didn't know what he was doing,",,INFO
he really should have hired people.,,INFO
"Well that's something,",,G_G
my husband's in construction,,INFO
and he won't even touch electrical stuff.,,INFO
"He, i-,",,CAT
"I mean, he'll do a little things",,INFO
but he won't do any major rewiring.,,INFO

He says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
he'll end up killing himself.,,INFO
Pardon.,,CAT
End up killing theirselves.,,CAT
That's right.,,G_G
"My husband, he'll change out a light switch,",,INFO
but that's about as far as he'll go.,,INFO
"Well that's the way mine is, you know,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, he, he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around",,INFO
"and he was like, oh my God,",,INFO

"And we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry,",,INFO
"Uh, was a what,",,CAT
The roof was really sorry.,,INFO
"I mean when we moved in,",,INFO

"Is it three or five,",,INFO
your husband probably knows.,,INFO
"He probably knows,",,CAT
I don't know what it is off hand.,,INFO
"Well, he's got seven layers of shingles up there,",,INFO
and he told us it was a completely new roof.,,INFO
"Like I said, he didn't know what he was doing.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT

"And we completely s-, completely stripped all the old wood shingles off, put decking up, put the paper down, and I mean just started from scratch.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain.,,INFO
"Oh, no.",,G_G
"And we, and we had, we had almost, I'd say about half of the roof off,",,INFO

and the light would come on,,INFO
and the whole thing would be full of water.,,INFO
And I mean the light would still come on.,,INFO

"Well, I had, uh, a little routine that I did for warm ups.",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"And then I did some very mild, say, light weight lifting.",,INFO
"Nothing,",,INFO
"I'm not trying to make big bulging muscles,",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"Um, right now, um, I try when it's nice out,",,INFO
"it's been raining a lot this spring,",,INFO
"but I try to, uh,",,INFO
I have a bicycle,,INFO
and I like to cycle a lot.,,INFO
"And, uh, my husband and I, we have entered a few rallies, that's pretty popular in Texas,",,INFO
"I don't know,",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"if it's up north,",,INFO
but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally,,INFO
"and thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles, which that's a lot of fun.",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"Um, so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that.",,INFO
"And, um, T I, where I work has, uh, a fitness center",,INFO
"so a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends, we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill,",,INFO
"and, um, they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine, that are fun to ride and workout on.",,INFO
"So I try to,",,INFO
I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis.,,INFO
"I used to, uh, get into it and get out of it based on my schedule,",,INFO
"so I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now,",,INFO
but it's a big commitment.,,INFO
We don't have any kids yet,,INFO
"so, that's a lot of, part of it.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
That's a plus.,,INFO
"Oh, I have a total of five children.",,INFO
I have three left living at home.,,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"And they do take up a big part of my, uh, my evening and weekend.",,INFO

"And it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children.,,INFO
Huh-uh,,CAT
.,,CAT
"That's why, they, uh, really stress, at T I, they really stress, staying in shape, like stay in fit, overall fitness, you know, no smoking and all that.",,INFO
"But it's hard to find, uh, an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, you know, because like I know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes",,INFO
and I don't know if that would work for me because I don't know I wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain.,,INFO
"But it's really hard to find something that works, and, you know, to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever.",,INFO
I think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"You have to,",,INFO
what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself.,,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"And you can use what ever rationale you want,",,INFO
"but basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, uh, you know, if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, well, then I'll around a lot longer,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"And those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now, well, you know, get the enjoyment of me, years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have taken it.",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Um, I've been learning a lot lately about, um,",,INFO
"I've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper,",,INFO
I don't know if you're familiar with him,,QUESTION
Huh-uh.,,CAT
he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really.,,INFO
"He's, he's, kind of, he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing.",,INFO
"Um, he was talking about the three things you could, that cause aging smoking are inactivity, * mistranscribed? listen",,INFO
"and what was the other one, I think was, yeah, obesity.",,INFO
"If you can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, you know, cause those are risk factors,",,INFO
"so anyway,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
it's kind of a tip.,,INFO
"Oh, I've done a lot of study over the years",,INFO
and I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water.,,INFO
Really,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Um, the research that I've done",,INFO
and I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three.,,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"And, it's amazing, that, uh, you know, prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks.",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
There were none prior to nineteen-hundred.,,INFO
"Well, in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water. In nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities,",,INFO
"and after that we,",,INFO
.,,CAT
we started having the hearts attacks,,INFO
"and, uh, Dr. Price wrote a book CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL, AND CHLORINE.",,INFO
You can usually find it in a health food store.,,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"I know they had it in health food stores in Plano,",,INFO
I used live in Plano.,,INFO
Dr. Price?,,CAT
"Uh, Dr. Price,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"And it's amazing,",,INFO
"he makes the,",,INFO
"you know, it's a very small book",,INFO
"and the guys very opinionated,",,INFO
"um, but he makes a very good case against chlorine.",,INFO
There were no heart attacks before we started using it,,INFO
"and he points out that people in, uh, England",,INFO
"and, uh, or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now,",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks.,,INFO
That's really interesting.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours.,,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"And, uh, proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis, which is the,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
clogging of the arteries.,,INFO
"And, uh, you know, he's,",,CAT
there's been a lot of reports since then.,,INFO
"This whole thing about,",,INFO
"first it was stress, then it went to cholesterol,",,INFO
"and now they're saying what's cholesterol,",,INFO
well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.,,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"You know, it's amazing what he points out in that book",,INFO
"and, in fact, he, everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency, who did work back in nineteen eighty-six, who wrote a letter to Dr. Price in nineteen eighty-seven. And in this letter he praised Dr. Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis.",,INFO
"And, E P A never published that report.",,INFO
And what's the name of this book again?,,QUESTION
"CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE.",,INFO
I'll have to remember that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
That will be very interesting.,,INFO
My husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon,,INFO
"so, he's really interested in the heart.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And he's, in fact, he's a, well, heart, too,",,INFO
"he's, uh, he's done a lot of research on like how your heart reacts to exercise",,INFO
"Sorry,",,G_G
he made me laugh.,,INFO
"Um, so anyway,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"There is, there is a lot of good information out there, uh, about health.",,INFO
"And a lot of the, a lot of the myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because that's, that's good for you,",,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"uh, but to believe some of the things,",,INFO
"you know, and I don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet,",,INFO
"but to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is, is just hard to believe.",,INFO
If you get a chance read Dr. Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol.,,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"That's a real good,",,INFO
"um, he talks about that.",,INFO
Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I actually eat pretty much anything that I want.,,INFO
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"And I've had my cholesterol checked and, uh, a few times",,INFO
"and I've never been above, like, you know, one-hundred and fifty,",,INFO

never.,,INFO
"And, uh, uh, I mean, I,",,CAT
You have a good ratio of good to bad.,,INFO
"Um,",,CAT
Cholesterol.,,INFO
"Well, what they tell me,",,CAT
"but, I mean, you know, everything is like within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing",,INFO
"You know, they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, we've,",,CAT
"I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley, Maryland.",,INFO
"Oh, really.",,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
and we've had a few of the health fairs up here,,INFO
"and, um, you know, I've always come out aces.",,INFO
That's good.,,G_G
"You know, I'm not really that big on watching what I eat,",,INFO
"but I do eat, you know, some health cookies that are high in fiber,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
low in fat and all that kind of stuff.,,INFO

"um, out and about",,INFO
"and there's,",,CAT

But they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything.,,INFO

Oh.,,CAT
But most time they run away from you,,INFO

"We, we want to,",,CAT

industry as being number one polluter.,,INFO

that's right.,,CAT
"Then we get out of that phase,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
soon enough.,,INFO
"But, um, I think another,",,INFO
"you can tell when you go around cities, you can smell specific things from, from, specific industries.",,INFO
"Oh, yes.",,INFO
"I remember being,",,INFO
"I, I grew up in New Jersey",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, I can remember the smell of Newark vividly",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
sure.,,CAT
"And it's the type of industry, you know, which obviously if you can smell it, it's in the air.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well, I know, uh, uh, in Michigan, uh, the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it,",,INFO
and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, um, of course, now,",,CAT
"Well, people think you burn it, it's gone,",,INFO
but it's not gone.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"and when they,",,CAT
.,,CAT
and you bury it,,INFO
"and it's not gone either, because it has untold ramifications.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh,",,INFO
Then it just gets into the soil and into the water,,INFO
"And it gets into, into people,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, which is, uh, the, the most important, um, resource that we have is people,",,INFO
"and they're, and they're destroying us,",,INFO
"they,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
really are.,,INFO
"We really have to do more,",,INFO
"So I think the cockroach will evolve, uh, sa-, safely",,INFO
.,,CAT
So they say,,CAT
I think we've got to do more with the recycling.,,INFO
"That's,",,CAT
"I'm, I'm really glad to see that there's more of that happening.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
but there's not enough.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And we need expert cooperation.,,INFO
"Well, it's a,",,CAT
"we're getting,",,CAT
"at least they're starting, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Education of the,",,INFO
So at least they're moving that direction.,,INFO
"Education of the people is primary, I would think.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, and we're hard to teach.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well,",,CAT
We are hard to teach.,,CAT
"it's going to, it's probably going to be a generation or two before,",,INFO
"Absolutely,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"before it's really going,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"very well, because now the adults are more aware of it,",,INFO
"and the children are being taught in the schools more, it'll be, you know, on down the road this is going to be passed on, which is good.",,INFO
"Absolutely,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"Uh, of course, uh, we would like to see it accelerated because, uh, of the critical nature of it.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"The, the learning of it and the,",,INFO
"just to, um, think that way, we have to be in that thought pattern and able to, um, motivate ourselves to, um, uh, do what is right for the atmosphere.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, I think we're all contributors.",,INFO
"I mean, every human being that lives is a contributor,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"to pollution,",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
we just um.,,INFO
"I think you're right,",,CAT
education is a big thing,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"and as we educate them individually what they can do, people become more aware of the things in industry too that, that are causing problems",,INFO
"and, and I think that they'll grad-, they'll work towards solving those problems more too. Um,",,INFO
"Well, hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"That the time frame for cleaning up our air and our, and our, um, land, you know, which, uh, we get our nutrients from.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, I mean,",,INFO
.,,CAT
everything goes back to the land.,,INFO
Just a minute and I'll turn it up.,,CAT
"I'll turn it up in a minute, honey, when I'm done.",,CAT
"So um, it's just, um, very critical, I think at this point to,",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
.,,CAT
"uh, get that through to the people and get us educated.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, I think science has come a long way to making it so that it's possible to find ways to solve the problem",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um,",,CAT
"I, I don't know if they offer classes in, uh, the, uh, in the grade school,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"uh, uh, subjecting.",,INFO
I think they teach it a lot in science,,INFO
"In science,",,CAT
okay.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
I would think that that's where it would come through.,,INFO
What grade level would that be?,,QUESTION
"Would that be, um, perhaps,",,QUESTION
"I,",,INFO
"the first grade level, which would be,",,INFO
I think they're kind of getting it in all different grades.,,INFO
"Well, I mean, are they starting, though, at, at, with the children that are so,",,QUESTION
their little minds are like sponges,,INFO
and they can really,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, relate to that.",,INFO
I think they are starting probably in the first grade.,,INFO
"They're, you know, they're hearing somewhat about it.",,INFO
"Um, I know, uh, Target has their program to make kids more aware of it",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
Target stores?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"They've got, if you go in the entrance, they've got, uh, stands usually where they have, um, little, uh, kind of a little newspaper thing",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
that the kids can read,,INFO
and,,INFO
"Oh, I see.",,CAT
"and they can form a, a group to, um,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
help fight the pollution.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, that's wonderful.",,G_G
"So,",,CAT
"Well, I'm sure that, uh, perhaps they're the leaders, you know,",,INFO
"and other will, others will pick up on their example and carry it, uh, further.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, because, uh, thoughts are,",,INFO
"Well, I, I know it's har-, it's a hard problem to solve because you, you know, like McDonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more,",,INFO
and then there's the paper and plastic bag question.,,INFO
,,
"Jimmy , so how do you get most of your news?",,QUESTION
"Well, I kind of, uh, I watch the, uh, national news every day, for one.",,INFO
I also read one or two papers a day,,INFO
"and I'm a, I'm pretty much a news junkie",,INFO
and I tune in to C N N a lot.,,INFO
"Oh, wow.",,G_G
"So, when you say the morning news, or evening news or national news is when?",,QUESTION
"Uh, every evening at six thirty, I believe,",,INFO
I watch the national news.,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,INFO
"Well, I would probably be a junkie or s-, watch C N N a lot,",,INFO
"but I don't, uh, I don't, uh, subscribe to cable",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"be-, because of the poor service and also, uh, because,",,INFO
"well, I, uh, I give to the United Way",,INFO
and so I figured that amount of money I just donate to that.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
as opposed to paying for cable.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I take away a, uh, addiction",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Oh, something.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well I,",,CAT
"Uh, overall I, I,",,CAT
"the quality of the news you get o-, off of most, uh, sources I would say is pretty low.",,INFO
"It's,",,CAT
usually you get pretty incomplete coverage,,INFO
"and that's one of the reasons where I, why I try and get as many sources as possible,",,INFO
"because if you hear the same story from three different sources, then you get a much clearer picture of, of what is going on. You would hope,",,INFO
"but still, you know, hard to say",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
that what you've heard is what really is.,,INFO
"What, what, uh, newspapers do you read?",,QUESTION
"Well, I read, uh, the local newspaper",,INFO
"and I also try and read one of the, uh, major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE, or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"For a while there I, I, I, uh, subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES, a-, actually a couple of newspapers because, uh, you know, my fiance,",,INFO
"well, she was unemployed for a while",,INFO
"so she, you know, really needed to look at the, the want-, help wanted ads",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and so often they, they tr-, the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of newspape-, uh, news.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, I don't know,",,CAT
"NEW YORK TIMES is okay,",,INFO
"but, uh, and when you read a lot of this stuff, the, the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so,",,INFO
but,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, I mean, they, they say it's like the sixth grade reading level,",,INFO
but,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"I swear it's at least second or third grade,",,INFO
.,,CAT
sometimes.,,INFO
Pretty low.,,INFO
"But, I don't know,",,INFO
"uh, I think if you listen to like N P R or something like,",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"I, I really like N P R a lot.",,INFO
That's pretty good.,,INFO
"Uh, and I like listening to that on, on, uh,",,INFO
"when I get a chance, when I'm in the car a long enough time to, to listen to it, because I,",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
I miss N P R a lot also.,,INFO
"I really like them because they give, uh,",,INFO
"instead of being, as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb, they go really in depth on topics which I think is good.",,INFO
"Uh,",,CAT
"And they also,",,CAT
"their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than, say, your major network news and that kind of thing.",,INFO
"Well, McNeil Neil-, and Lehrer,",,INFO
"I guess he's leaving,",,INFO
one of them is leaving.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, they're, they're pretty good, too.",,INFO
"Uh, I guess a year ago you're probably watching C N N a lot, right?",,QUESTION
Right,,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
Had that invasion or whatever it is.,,INFO
Sure was.,,CAT
"Uh, but I, I don't know,",,CAT
I guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype.,,INFO
"Look at the, the Smith trial.",,COMMAND
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean, that was a joke.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that was,",,INFO
"but then you also have things where you, uh, where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was r-, really good.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"the N P R doing that,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"I know,",,INFO
"I had, uh, some visitor",,INFO
"and he was just in-, just, I don't know, fixated on that, you know, just listened to it",,INFO
Uh-uh.,,CAT
constantly.,,INFO
"Uh, and I guess that's good when it's live, if you, if you'll really want that,",,INFO
but that's not really providing you news.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"It's, it's more like a media event rather than",,INFO
"Well, but the",,INFO
reporting.,,INFO
"but the ne-, news, news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event, which is something that's good also about C Span which I, I tune into every once in a while.",,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
"That's kind of boring to me, I think.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it, it is, really kind of boring,",,INFO
"but, you know, that's,",,CAT
"if, if you don't watch it there, then you're going to hear somebody else's canned, uh, report, somebody else's view about it",,INFO
"and that's what you're supposed, you're supposed to,",,INFO
"if you watch the news, you're going, your opinion is going to be formed about, on what somebody else thought about it",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own pinion, opinion, which I haven't, would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I guess that's true.,,INFO
"But, one of the ways that I get information is, uh, every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this, this thing,",,INFO
"it's free inside the company,",,INFO
it's called INTELLECT,,INFO
"and, and they basically, uh, type out abstracts which are really literally,",,INFO
"I've, I've actually read the actual articles,",,INFO
"they're pretty g-,",,INFO
,,
"Uh, what i-, what is your practice as far as budgeting?",,QUESTION
Do you manage the money?,,QUESTION
"Well, I, we talk about it,",,INFO
"but I'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and, and tries to somehow make the ends meet, which, uh,",,INFO
"Oh, I see.",,CAT
"That's how kind of I am, too.",,INFO
Are you married?,,QUESTION
"Um, yes.",,CAT
You are.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
I think the women for the most part end up managing the money.,,INFO
"My husband always says he earns it, and I have to spend only what he earns",,INFO
"It,",,CAT
"I don't mind the spending,",,INFO
"it's just that trying to, trying to get what you need out of, out of what you have.",,INFO
That seems to be our challenge.,,INFO
"Well, I don't work outside of the home,",,INFO
"and he always threatens that when I spend more than,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"what's coming in, I have to go back to work",,INFO
I see.,,CAT
"so I, I manage it",,INFO
"Well, I'm, I'm at home also,",,INFO
"so, it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary, uh,",,INFO
"Now, do you actually follow a budget?",,QUESTION
"Well, we pretty well do.",,INFO
"Um, several years we didn't,",,INFO
"and we found that we just weren't making the most of what we had,",,INFO
"and so we, we, um, set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for, you know,",,INFO
just our bills.,,INFO
And then what's left we divvy up.,,INFO
"We try to save a little bit, although we're not always successful,",,INFO
and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs.,,INFO
"Well, that's pretty much the way we do, um, or we did in the past,",,INFO
"I would say. Uh,",,INFO
"at this point our children are grown,",,INFO
and so I really don't have the obligations there any more,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
that we have to balance to,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"you know, get things together for them,",,INFO
"and I really just keep very good records,",,INFO
"and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that,",,INFO
and,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
I try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, I don't always succeed at that.",,INFO
"I usually keep one with a low interest rate,",,INFO
and I put things on there that I think I'm not going to get to,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and then I have another one,",,INFO
"but for the most part, our mortgage and our utilities at this point, we're in a new home, and, uh, they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"so I'm still getting used to that,",,INFO
but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and we do not buy us, new cars.",,INFO
"Uh, do you get into car,",,QUESTION
"Well, we had new cars, um, always until about four years ago,",,CAT
"my husband, um, owned his own company and it went under,",,INFO
"and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment,",,INFO
"and now it just seems just such a large amount of money to spend that, that we do have a used car,",,INFO
"well, he has a company car also,",,INFO
but for our personal car we have a used car.,,INFO
"Um, do you think that it's wiser to buy used?",,QUESTION
We do for us very much so.,,CAT
"In fact, we are in a position that most of our friends why, wonder why we just don't go to a new car, you know, whatever,",,INFO
and I said,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"look, you guys are all into car payments,",,INFO
"we haven't had car payments for so many years,",,INFO
"I love it this way,",,INFO
and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked,,INFO
and it has eighty-two thousand miles on it,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and we were, kept saying, wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Believe it or not, we did, we found one, one newer",,INFO
"Oh, no,",,G_G
"the worst part is, it's the same color",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and so everybody's saying, you're kidding,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"you have two cars the same,",,INFO
"and I said, you know how when you have a bad one, you say, never again",,INFO
That's right,,G_G
"I said, well, we had one, and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it",,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"and it's an eighty-five,",,INFO
"and so I said, Hey, this was a cinch,",,INFO
"we paid for the car,",,INFO
and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"This is for all the long running back and forth on, you know interstate driving and things,",,INFO
"and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years, or next year probably.",,INFO
"Do you, um, buy from dealers or from individuals?",,QUESTION
"Generally from dealers,",,INFO
"and uh, it depends, because I don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"uh, unless we, we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"you know, we were going up to a larger one,",,INFO
"but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer, and we always make a deal.",,INFO
"I mean, we have walked out of more dealerships saying, don't bring us the manager, and all of that unless you want to bring him right away.",,INFO
You're going to get one shot at us,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"we will, you know,",,INFO
"and they say, Well, you're kidding, you know.",,INFO
"I s-,",,CAT
"no,",,INFO
.,,CAT
this is the price we're going to give you out the door.,,INFO
"We don't want to hear about taxes,",,INFO
,,
"I was going to say, my, uh, college is Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota,",,INFO
"and our head football coach, Dennis Muir used to be an assistant coach at B Y U.",,INFO
"Oh, really.",,CAT
"So I thought that was kind of an in-, interesting coincidence.",,INFO
Huh,,CAT
So you went to what college?,,CAT
"Uh, Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota.",,INFO
And what did you graduate in?,,QUESTION
"I ju-,",,CAT
in what major or what year?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
major,,INFO
International business.,,INFO
"Oh, really.",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
And you?,,QUESTION
"I'm going to B Y U,",,INFO
and I'm going into nursing,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
so.,,CAT
"Well, that sounds interesting.",,G_G
How long of a program is that?,,QUESTION
Forever,,INFO
.,,CAT
"Seems like, anyways.",,INFO
"It's about five years,",,INFO
"but it's probably going to take me longer, because I didn't decide to major in that until, uh, about a year and a half after I was already in school,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"You know, I read a study once,",,INFO
"and it said that, uh, like thirty-four percent of, uh, college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program.",,INFO
"Oh, really.",,CAT
That sounds.,,INFO
"It took me, it took me five years.",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"So, you just, you get started",,INFO
"and you change your mind,",,INFO
"or you want to pick up a second major,",,INFO
"if you're management, you, you, thought, I, I'll take that marketing,",,INFO
it's just only was three more classes,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"and you, just doesn't happen that you get out in four years.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
But.,,CAT
So what is your advice to,,QUESTION
My advice is,,INFO
picking a college.,,INFO
"is, uh, look for, at the student to faculty ratio, you know,",,INFO
"if you're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one, I don't think you're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Is that, what was yours more like?",,QUESTION
Yeah,,CAT
"Was there a,",,CAT
it was about twenty-six to one.,,INFO
Really.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, that's great.",,G_G
"Which is, you know,",,CAT
"it, it's interesting,",,INFO
"but it, it's",,CAT
"what I thought was nice is you could al-, there was always time to talk to professor, you know,",,INFO
"and, and they knew you.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You weren't just in their class, you know,",,INFO
"and so you could, you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time,",,INFO
"and, or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever, you know, you could sit down, talk to them about a problem.",,INFO
They're always willing to help you out.,,INFO
"So, but I, I's, I, I put that against, uh, my high school where we had, uh, a biology class of three hundred and fifty students",,INFO
and.,,CAT
"Wow, in high school?",,QUESTION
Yeah,,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
it was a biology lecture class,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"and, you know, it, it just wasn't the same.",,INFO
"You're sitting there,",,INFO
and you're taking notes,,INFO
"and, you know, you got a computerized test scores, multiple choice, because there's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, you know, a three hundred fifty person short answer test.",,INFO
"And, it just wasn't the same.",,INFO
"You, you'd run, you'd pass the teacher in high school",,INFO
"and, even in high school you could say high to your teachers, unless you're in that biology class,",,INFO
"and they just, they'd look at you like, do I know you?",,INFO
or should I know you?,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"there's, it's,",,CAT
"the classes here are pretty big,",,INFO
"so, it's hard to get individual help",,INFO
"It's kind of, you're on your own",,INFO
"Do you get, uh, a lot of tutoring,",,QUESTION
or.,,CAT
No,,CAT
"Very little, I mean,",,INFO
"well, like my,",,CAT
"for example, I have, I'm in a chemistry class right now",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and there's tons of students in it,",,INFO
and there's one T A for the whole class.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"And he only has certain office hours,",,INFO
"and so there's only certain times you can talk to him,",,INFO
and.,,CAT
And you could get there,,INFO
"and his office hours could, I mean he could have like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty-two people waiting to talk to him,",,INFO
and you still didn't get to talk to him anyway.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Well, what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college?",,QUESTION
"Oh, man. I think your advice is good.",,CAT
Um let's see. My advice would be to pick a major before you get into college,,INFO
That's excellent advice.,,INFO
"because I, I didn't,",,INFO
"and I took tons of classes that I didn't need to,",,INFO
"and, um, I don't know,",,CAT
"I just feel like I'm, it's, it's going to take me a lot longer than,",,INFO
"and not that's always bad,",,INFO
"but it's,",,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"it's frustrating, I guess.",,INFO
"Well, it, it, it does get it.",,INFO
"You know, you get to the point where it's, I'm never going to get done.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"You know, I, I mean, I was taking summer classes",,INFO
and let me get out of here.,,INFO
Yep.,,CAT
"But, uh, no,",,CAT
that's good advice.,,INFO
"Even if you don't have your major decided on, have an idea what you think you might want, you know,",,INFO
"so you don't want management,",,INFO
"but you think you want business,",,INFO
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
so you have eight children.,,INFO
"Um, what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together.",,QUESTION
"Oh, we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging, bicycling, uh, going to the park, um, some time watching V C R",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
movies,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"um, generally cheap things",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
we know how that goes.,,G_G
"Uh, with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation.",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"Well, that's fun.",,G_G
"So, um, let's see, uh,",,CAT
"some of the things we do together as a family, we like to play games a lot,",,INFO
"and you may think this is funny,",,INFO
"but one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek,",,INFO
and we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"in our house,",,INFO
and that is so fun.,,INFO
The kids just get a crack out of that.,,INFO
"Um, we like, we do like to go to the park, too you, uh, like your family.",,INFO
"Um, we don't do a lot of vacationing.",,INFO
Have you taken a lot of vacations together,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
Most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa.,,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"and whe-,",,CAT
We get an occasional one or two day thing,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
but most of them are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa.,,INFO
"Oh, now where do they live?",,QUESTION
In Arizona.,,INFO
"Oh, so that's a bit of a drive for you there.",,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
"Oh, so you like to go there for the holidays",,QUESTION
and.,,CAT
"Oh, we don't go very often for holidays.",,CAT
Generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and let Grandma and Grandpa come and visit us.,,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"Uh, what are the ages of your kids then?",,QUESTION
They range from twenty-four to five.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"So you have some in the nest and some out, huh.",,QUESTION
That's right.,,CAT
.,,CAT
How old are your children?,,QUESTION
"We have,",,CAT
ours start at twelve,,INFO
and then they go down to four.,,INFO
"I think the hardest thing for us has been, is to find ac-, you know, leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together",,INFO
"I bet,",,G_G
yeah.,,CAT
"with the age span that we have, you know,",,INFO
like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but the young kids don't understand it,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that,",,INFO
and.,,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT
"and then if you want to play something on the little kids' level, then the older kids get real bored,",,INFO
and they want to do something else.,,INFO
So.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I can, I can relate to that.",,G_G
"Um, do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one?",,QUESTION
"I think it's improving, actually.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
We had an interesting experience the other day.,,INFO
"We, we have pretty much a, a routine that we spend,",,INFO
we don't have our kids play with other kids on Sunday,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and we just kind of keep them at home,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and our next door neighbor, uh,",,INFO
"we were at a soccer game Saturday,",,INFO
"and our next door neighbor was there,",,INFO
and somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend Saturday night at their house,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and she said, no, Sunday's our family day",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them.,,INFO
That's good.,,G_G
And I think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now.,,INFO
"Oh, good.",,G_G
I think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now.,,INFO
"I think so,",,CAT
"and I feel like, you know, like President Bush, Bush has mentioned quite often, that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation,",,INFO
and it does begin with the families at home,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and so I, I'm a firm believer in that, too.",,INFO
"I think a lot of people are panicked, how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something.",,INFO
So.,,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT
"that's, that's true.",,CAT
"Well, we see that a lot out here in Utah,",,INFO
"and, um, hopefully, hopefully it's going to spread, huh. .",,INFO
Utah's a lot better than Texas.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"Um, do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas,",,QUESTION
or.,,CAT
Very few.,,CAT
Very few.,,CAT
You feel like you're in the minority?,,QUESTION
"Oh, definitely.",,CAT
.,,CAT
When we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense.,,INFO
"Oh, dear",,G_G
"But, uh.",,CAT
"Well, out here in Utah, five is about the",,INFO
Average.,,INFO
"the average,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
My wife and I were in Utah until,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
I guess we were about twenty-four.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Never been back, since then,",,INFO
"but,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"We have kids up there now,",,INFO
so we get up occasionally.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"Oh, I have some relatives out there in Texas,",,INFO
"in fact my mom's out there in Texas right now, in Dallas, spending a month with her cousins, on their ranch,",,INFO
and.,,CAT
"Where, where in Dallas?",,QUESTION
"Well, uh, no,",,CAT
"I'm trying, Aberdeen?",,CAT
Huh.,,CAT
"Is, is that close to Dallas?",,QUESTION
I don't have any idea.,,CAT
I've never,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
heard of it.,,INFO
Must be a,,INFO
Don't you.,,CAT
little town.,,INFO
"It's, I guess it's out there, clear out.",,INFO
"They have a ranch that has like five hundred acres,",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
,,
"Actually, to tell you the truth, I think, uh, jury selection is a, uh, prime, uh, discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on, uh, uh, finding of, uh, guilt.",,INFO
"Uh, I certainly can't argue with that.",,CAT
"Definitely does need some improvements. Uh,",,INFO
.,,CAT
and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think there's a limit on that.,,INFO
"The, uh, the, uh",,INFO
"I think it's,",,INFO
"peremptory challenges are limited to, I don't know how many,",,INFO
"but you can,",,CAT
"Four or five,",,INFO
I can't remember which.,,CAT
I was on a jury trial last year,,INFO
"only I got kicked out as, uh, the last selection that the, uh, defense got.",,INFO
"Um. Yeah,",,CAT
it seems to me I'm always challenged peremptorily also when I go to these things.,,INFO
I think I have a severe demeanor or something.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"Uh,",,CAT
"That, uh,",,CAT
"But, typically, you know, basic-, uh, typically, uh, everyone gets involved in, uh, the jury process",,INFO
"and I suppose an elitist might say, well, you really want someone who is well educated to be able to, to winnow the facts from the, from the prejudice.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
but it still has to be a group of your peers.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
See.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"So, if it's your peers and you're not educated",,INFO
So if you're a,,INFO
"then,",,INFO
"nincompoop on trial, you'd, you'd have to have",,INFO
You want,,INFO
"nincompoops to, uh,",,INFO
you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them.,,INFO
"So, that's why the defense is there picking through them, whereas at the same time, the, uh, the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him, uh, a guilty verdict if the facts warrant.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, uh, I think the jury selection process is pretty neat,",,INFO
but I don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
afterwards.,,INFO
I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have.,,INFO
"M-, you're talking about, the person's already been found guilty, right",,QUESTION
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"and many times I've seen on trials they have on T V, the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever,",,INFO
"but I think that it should be up to the judge and the, uh, lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
Maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and what it's all about,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and believe in the system.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure.",,INFO
"Well, I suppose you may be right on that.",,CAT
As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure.,,INFO
"Matter of fact, I've heard that,",,INFO
"Also, may be a more consistent sentencing procedure.",,INFO
"I've heard that some of the information, uh, is prevented from reaching the jury, like, uh, mitigating circumstances or, or preceding, uh, criminal record or things of this nature that,",,INFO
"Well, preceding criminal record, according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime.",,INFO
"But when it comes to, uh, sentencing for punishment, of course, if the person's never done anything bad before, according to the judicial system, then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side,",,INFO
and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury.,,INFO
"Oh, is it?",,QUESTION
"Oh, I didn't realize that.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"At least in California, they're supposed to be.",,INFO
"Not during the trial,",,INFO
during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"But when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down, I think that, uh, that they should.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I don't, I don't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial.",,INFO
They get too boring.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, you, what you're saying is this, if there is the second offense, then you execute them.",,INFO
"Well, if it's a second offense, the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense, because obviously, the rehabilitation process did not work the first time.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
So you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better.,,INFO
"When it comes down to things like alternative sentencing, I'm all for that for, uh, small crimes, infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant,",,INFO
you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things.,,INFO
"What about, uh, white collar crimes like, uh, theft of trade secrets.",,QUESTION
I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are.,,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
Like what?,,QUESTION
"Well, uh, say, embezzlement, right.",,INFO
"Ri-,",,CAT
"You get a guy down the street who comes up, uh, carrying a kni-,",,INFO
,,
"Uh, why don't you go ahead first.",,COMMAND
Okay.,,CAT
"Uh, short term, uh, it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over",,INFO
"so budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much, uh",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
extra to go around.,,INFO
"Uh, long term is something we're starting to think about because our older child will be ready for college in about, uh, gee,",,INFO
she's eight now,,INFO
so I guess about ten years.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Good heavens.,,G_G
"So we're, we're starting to think about long term considerations. College and retirement.",,INFO
"But with not a whole lot of discretionary money, it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it.",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
How about you?,,QUESTION
"That's kind of, uh,",,CAT
"to what we're doing is budgeting, you know.",,INFO
"Month to month is, uh, kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra",,INFO
"so that's kind of how we do it, uh, from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, long term, that's a little bit easier for us because, uh, with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings, Four Oh One K plans",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, that kind of, you know, retirement plans, that kind of stuff",,INFO
so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
versus when it's on the paycheck,,INFO
and you have to try and take out some of that money.,,INFO
You always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month,,INFO
"so, uh, long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because, uh, it's automatically taken out.",,INFO
"So, uh, that works out much better for us,",,INFO
so that's kind of how we do it anyway,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"And the old, uh, if you can't see it, then you can't spend it, uh, idea",,INFO
"E-, exactly",,CAT
"and if you can't touch it, you can't spend it either.",,INFO
"So that kind of works out where you get into, uh, some plans that, you know, you touch it you're going to get a penalty, that kind of thing,",,INFO
so it leads you to kind of say well I'm not going to take it out.,,INFO
"I'm going to keep it and, uh, keep it in there and let it grow so that someway, maybe for retirement you're going to have that money",,INFO
.,,CAT
left.,,INFO
"Let's hope anyway,",,INFO
so,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
you'll have that,,INFO
so that's kind of how we do it.,,INFO
"But ours is more like month to month too, uh,",,INFO
"short term is, to get things going",,INFO
"so. Anyway, other than that, uh, is kind of how we do it",,INFO
so. I don't,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"know if we're, our time is up or what",,INFO
"Uh, they'll, uh",,CAT
They'll let us know,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
exactly.,,INFO
"We, we actually do have some money in a Four Oh One K.",,INFO
I just,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"wish I could afford to, uh, put more away each week because I agree that it's a, an excellent way,",,INFO
"Oh, definitely,",,CAT
definitely.,,CAT
"And, uh, it grows, uh,",,INFO
"it, it seems like at first you're not going to see a big return",,INFO
"but as the years go on, if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better",,INFO
"and, uh,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"so, you know, you just have to kind of look at it that way",,INFO
and there's other savings plans or other things that you can do.,,INFO
"Automatic, you know, deposit from checks to where you don't see it.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, uh, you know, exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It's put into our savings account,,INFO
"and we don't see it,",,INFO
"then it works out to where, you know, you don't look at it,",,INFO
"you just look at the checking account,",,INFO
.,,CAT
and say this is what we have for money,,INFO
"and that's it,",,INFO
so,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be I'm convinced.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it, it's easy because you do spend it,",,INFO
that's for sure.,,G_G
"Like I said, you know, you kind of look at it, uh,",,INFO
"you better have some other way of, uh, savings,",,INFO
"otherwise, uh, checking accounts aren't the best for, you know, long term type of planning,",,INFO
"so. And you don't get a good return on it anyway,",,INFO
"so, other,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I guess there, other than things like the stock market or mutual funds, there's really not much of a return on anything these days.",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
Right now.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it's a bad time, you know.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
the interest is so low.,,INFO
"I mean it, it's nice for people buying homes",,INFO
but,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
for older people who have money,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"in C D -s or whatever, it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever.",,INFO
"Exactly,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
"You know, we have some in-laws, uh, that, uh, had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and, uh, kind of took them out of that because they got so low",,INFO
"but, uh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"it's, it drops",,INFO
"so your better bet is to, uh, try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of, uh, savings plans or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever so or some kind of profit sharing",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I'm, I'm with a small company now",,INFO
"and I hope that, uh, if we're successful that they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
that'll be very nice.,,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's great,",,G_G
yeah,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
Well I guess we're kind of running out of steam on this topic here.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
exactly,,CAT
,,
So.,,CAT
"Okay,",,CAT
"do you rec-, exercise regularly.",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
I sure do.,,INFO
What do you do?,,QUESTION
"Uh, I ride a bicycle quite a bit and uh, work out with free weights",,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
I love to ride a bicycle.,,INFO
"I live right near White Rock Lake,",,INFO
"so I used to, I try to ride, about ten to twenty miles a day.",,INFO
"But, I",,INFO
"Oh, that's good.",,G_G
"haven't been doing so well this year,",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"I went an, last year I went an was exercising on a bike for a while",,INFO
"and I, when I'd gotten back I had gotten some sun that day,",,INFO
the sweat had built up on me and built up under my skin and caused me to peel.,,INFO
"It was the sweating, not the burn",,INFO
Oh that's weird .,,G_G
that was wild,,INFO
"But, I exercise, I don't exercise now,",,INFO
"I just had a baby three months ago,",,INFO
I haven't really gotten back into exercising.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
But I exercised real good for a couple of years.,,INFO
It was aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week,,INFO
and it was running three nights a week.,,INFO
So what's your motivation?,,QUESTION
"What, what's my motivation?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"A friend of mine, always pushing me.",,INFO
This was in Louisiana.,,INFO
"And she would push, you know,",,INFO
"she was, hey,",,INFO
"let's go do it,",,INFO
"and you know, she wouldn't take no for an answer",,INFO
"Was it for health, or, to look good?",,QUESTION
"Oh, I ju-, I just wanted to look good,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"I was think,",,CAT
it wasn't really health related.,,INFO
It was just a side benefit.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"because I'm not , I'm not big or anything,",,INFO
"but I'm not in great shape,",,INFO
"so. But when I worked out, I got in pretty good shape.",,INFO
"I didn't build up muscle, though,",,INFO
I just got real good and toned.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I don't think women look good with muscles.,,INFO
Up to a point.,,INFO
"Up to a point,",,INFO
"no,",,CAT
"m-, yeah,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
It's just some of those women that come up there looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"so what was, what was the other question,",,QUESTION
"let's see, do you do it as a task",,QUESTION
"or do you enjoy, enjoy working out.",,QUESTION
I guess it's a task 'cause I can't make myself do it lately.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think I, uh, I enjoy it sometimes",,INFO
and there's other times when I just get tired of it,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and I feel like I'm obligated to do it, because I've been doing it",,INFO
so I should keep up.,,INFO
You don't want to lose yourself.,,INFO
"And there's some days it's just like it's the hardest thing in the world to, to get started.",,INFO
Well how old are you?,,QUESTION
"I'm, uh, twenty-seven.",,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
so you're still young.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"still young, getting older.",,INFO
"We all are,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"but, uh,",,CAT
"It's not hard to stay,",,INFO
"well if you keep working out when you're young though, when you get older, you know, your body's not going to look as bad.",,INFO
"I seen an old woman today,",,INFO
she was about eighty,,INFO
"and she looked so good,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I mean she was standing just as straight and tall,,INFO
and she had a small waist,,INFO
"and she didn't have, you know, like,",,INFO
"you know, how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle.",,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
"A-, she didn't have that at all.",,INFO
"She, her lips were a little bit wide,",,INFO
"but a lot of,",,CAT
"back in her time, they liked women with big hips anyway",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"so she may be keeping that on purpose,",,INFO
so,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I notice if you, uh, if you stay in shape you don't age as bad,",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"I think, too.",,CAT
"I was, I go to school, too, at night",,INFO
"and last semester I had stopped working out 'cause I hurt myself and started smoking a lot,",,INFO
"and you just,",,CAT
those kind of things age you more.,,INFO
"Well smoking ages you quick,",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
an,,CAT
it puts those little wrinkles around your lips.,,INFO
right,,CAT
"an you can't,",,CAT
"and then, you know, it just kind of feeds itself.",,INFO
"You smoke,",,INFO
"and then you don't work out because you,",,INFO
You get winded.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"and so,",,CAT
"Oh, I smoke a pack a day",,INFO
"an,",,CAT
"I finally quit because, like I just, all I was doing was going down hill fast.",,INFO
"I can't quit smoking,",,INFO
I've tried.,,INFO
"I was telling a friend of mine that I'd be almo-, almost as bad as being an alcoholic,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I can't quit smoking.,,INFO
"I've tried,",,INFO
I just can't do it.,,INFO
"I quit when I was pregnant with my kids,",,INFO
"but, you know, as soon as I had them, right back to it.",,INFO
Right back to them.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"It was like, you know,",,CAT
that was the only reason I quit.,,INFO
I didn't want to.,,INFO
"Oh that's,",,CAT
"And I don't want to quit smoking,",,INFO
I enjoy that.,,INFO
"I said I have very few vices,",,INFO
I'll keep this one thank you,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, did you ever go to like one of those health clubs or anything?",,QUESTION
"I went to health club a few years ago,",,CAT
"and now I work out at home, because I don't really, my schedule with school and work, I don't have time to get down to one.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
There used to be one that was a twenty-four hour that I used to go to,,INFO
"but, uh, I actually prefer to work out alone.",,INFO
"I like to work out with people,",,INFO
Really.,,QUESTION
"I need,",,CAT
"like you,",,CAT
"I, I need competition, is what I need.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I've got to have somebody to compete with,",,INFO
or I don't want to do anything.,,INFO
"I wouldn't mind having, you know, working out with a friend and, and stuff",,INFO
"but when you get into some of these, some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"are you,",,CAT
"You know, I like to start, get it done and get out of there.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
are you married or anything?,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
I'm not.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"well, get your girlfriend to work out with you.",,INFO
A lot of women like that.,,INFO
I'd love it if my husband would ask me to work out with him.,,INFO
He doesn't work out very often.,,INFO
"Course, he don't need to.",,INFO
He's small,,INFO
and he works as a laborer on the railroad.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, you know, he's building his muscles up all day,",,INFO
he doesn't have to do anything.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"He can eat like a horse, too.",,INFO
"And he don't, you know, he don't gain it like I do.",,INFO
"But, uh,",,CAT
"Uh, especially having a kid, I guess, tends to just gain weight because you have to, to,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
you have to.,,INFO
"to, uh,",,INFO
Well you can gain too much weight.,,INFO
"I gained a little bit too much,",,INFO
"but I looked,",,CAT
"with my first little boy, I did gain a lot of weight,",,INFO
"I got, I got about fifty pounds overweight with him",,INFO
and I didn't loose it until two years ago,,INFO
"and then I got pregnant and, you know, ruined that,",,INFO
so,,CAT
Just have to start all over.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, actually, like I say, it ain't as bad this time, because I was in shape when I got pregnant.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"I wasn't out of sha-, I wasn't overweight when I got pregnant with him,",,INFO
"I just wasn't in, in shape.",,INFO
I don't know the difference,,CAT
"but,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
some people are a little bit fanatical about it.,,INFO
"You know, I,",,CAT
About weight?,,CAT
"Well yeah,",,CAT
"and about,",,INFO
Exercise.,,INFO
"working out and fitness, you know,",,INFO

I've been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around.,,INFO
"I'm scared to run, for dogs.",,INFO
"Course I know dogs can get you on a bike too,",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"seems like it,",,INFO
At least you got a chance to out run them that way.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
I don't like to run myself.,,INFO
I've thought about it several times,,INFO
"and I just, it, I like to move a little faster and cover more ground.",,INFO
"Well they,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
they've come up that running is not as good for you as they thought it was.,,INFO
"It's probably, I would think it would be hard on your, your legs and your joints and stuff.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
it's real hard on your legs,,INFO
and it's hard on women.,,INFO
"And it, it just makes stuff move down.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, but I, I, I like jogging,",,INFO
I don't mind that.,,INFO
"I can get out and do that,",,INFO
"Uh, I can't.",,INFO
as long as it's not hot.,,INFO
"If it's hot, you can't do that.",,INFO
"But in the rain, oh, I love to run in the rain,",,INFO
"just, you know, be careful not to slide.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But you can't ride your bike at all in the rain, can you.",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"you can't,",,INFO
it's dangerous.,,INFO
You slide.,,INFO
At least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could,,INFO
"but a regular ten speed with those skinny tires,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
you slide all over the place.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, I, when I did ride my friend's bike, that one time, I had, uh, I don't know what I was trying to do.",,INFO
I was trying to make a U turn,,INFO
"and I never could make a U turn in a bike,",,INFO
"I can do it in my car,",,INFO
but I tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked,,INFO
and I told her a dog was chasing me,,INFO
But I wrecked it into the curb.,,INFO
I didn't hurt it too bad.,,INFO
"I scratched it on the, the oh,",,INFO

"All right,",,G_G
bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
"Okay, uh,",,CAT
"I was just trying to think about how I, how I dress for work, you know,",,INFO
T I is a very casual atmosphere.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, what I usually do on the weekend is, is lay out five outfits",,INFO
"and, uh, on Monday I, I wear the, the worst looking one",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Because it doesn't seem like people are really, ar-, you know, are that alive on Monday, you know,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"And then progressively through the week, I'll, I'll wear nicer looking things",,INFO
"and then on Friday most everybody wears jeans, jeans and sweatshirts, or, you know, jeans and blouses or something like that.",,INFO
"Uh, but mostly what I wear are skirts and blouses or, you know, skirts and, uh, pullover sweaters or, uh, you know, little two piece dress suit, suits like,",,INFO
but.,,CAT
"Yeah, uh,",,CAT
"you know, that's a good way to approach it.",,INFO
"I've never thought about, um,",,INFO
I do plan my clothes a week in advance.,,INFO
"Actually, I plan them a month in advance.",,INFO
"I usually do a month at a time,",,INFO
so I don't repeat an outfit.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, um, I've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on Monday, because really no one's paying attention.",,INFO
"But anyway, um, I really, I don't work outside of school.",,INFO
"Um, I work in the computer lab at school",,INFO
"so I can just wear whatever I have on for school,",,INFO
"an, and, um, and really it's,",,CAT
"I try to dre-, dress presentable but very comfortable.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Like, um, in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that",,INFO
"and then in the winter time it's jeans or, or pants.",,INFO
"I usually, uh, you know,",,CAT
"college is so casual,",,INFO
"you really don't want to dress up unless you, you, uh, have a job",,INFO
"and you have to be there right after school or something like that,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"Like where I work, it's, it's pretty casual, uh,",,INFO
"it's, it's, I guess it's more like a, a college campus",,INFO
"also, I mean there's hundre-, you know, hundreds of people work for T I.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, a lot of people just, just wear jeans and, and, uh, sweats all the time",,INFO
"and they dress up like when customers are coming in,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"or, uh, when we have department meetings or something like that.",,INFO
"And, uh, you know, a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their, the real, uh, higher ups,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"like the the, lawy-, the T I lawyers, and, uh, those that work for the, the higher executives, those secretaries. They, uh, they really dress up all the time.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"So there's a good combination in the hallways all the time, you know",,INFO
Well that's good that they're so casual.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, uh, my brother works for T I",,INFO
"and he's a computer programmer, or computer engineer.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, you know, whenever he was going to school, he was expecting to having to wear, uh, a tie or a dress shirt everyday.",,INFO
"But, uh, he goes to work in his blue jeans, t-shirt,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and tennis shoes,",,INFO
and he just loves it.,,INFO
And that's very acceptable at T I.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I believe at I B M they, they make you wear a blue suit and, uh, some kind of colored shirt and a tie.",,INFO
That's what I've heard.,,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"I wo-, I would hate to be in that atmosphere.",,INFO
"But, uh, I mean, they, they just moved into the new building,",,INFO
he calls it the new building.,,INFO
"I don't know,",,CAT
it's where all the executives are.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, um, and so they were, they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the, all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans.",,INFO
"But, he just left for Italy today at four,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
and he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them.,,INFO
I see.,,CAT
"Over in T, I mean for T I but over in Italy.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"oh, T I is everywhere.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
he was so excited about going.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, uh, he didn't carry any ties or anything because he, he just went over there with the that attitude, well if I don't take it then they won't make me wear it",,INFO
"That's true,",,CAT
that's a good idea.,,INFO
"Because, uh, he just, he didn't, you know,",,INFO
he's not really into all that.,,INFO
He would wear it if he had to for his job and all,,INFO
"but, you know, if he had the preference, I mean his, his preference is, um, blue jeans and a t-shirt,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But I think that's great about T I,",,INFO
"and also, uh, to get off the clothing, the smokers, you know, how they have the,",,INFO
"The,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
the different designated areas for smokers and stuff.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
I think that's great.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke, smoke area and you don't smoke, you almost strangle.",,INFO
"Oh, really.",,CAT
Do you smoke?,,QUESTION
So much smoke in the air.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"areas, the smoking area, you know, it's closed in,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and if you don-, if you don't smoke and you go in there,",,INFO
"tha-, everybody that goes in there smokes",,INFO
"so it's full of smoke when, when you go in there.",,INFO
I used to smoke a long time ago.,,INFO
"I think that's, um,",,INFO
"I used to burn my clothes, talking about getting back to clothes",,INFO
I used to burn my clothes with cigarettes.,,INFO
That's one of the reason that I stopped,,INFO
"Well, um, y-, you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college.",,INFO
Well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions,,QUESTION
"and, uh?",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"she always had, uh, yeah, she always had to have a lot of clothes.",,INFO
"See that's how, that's how I am",,INFO
but my mamma was not raised like that,,INFO
"and so,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"I, I wasn't either,",,INFO
"she, my daughter, she's real good at finding sales though, you know.",,INFO
"Oh, me to,",,INFO
boy I have,,INFO
"Sh-, she'll buy a lot of,",,INFO
"to, hunt them down",,INFO
"sh-, yeah, she'll buy a lot clothes, at the end of seasons, you know,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, just have them for the next year.",,INFO
"And she, you know, she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and, uh, buys clothes.",,INFO
"Uh, whe-, you know, when they were coming up, I, I didn't sew,",,INFO
"but now I've, I've learned how to sew,",,INFO
"so I'm, well I'm, I'm still learning how,",,INFO
"but I'm ge-, and I'm getting much better at it",,INFO
"and I,",,INFO
That's great.,,G_G
I'm going to be able to make my own clothes.,,INFO
I wanted to take a sewing class at school,,INFO
"but I just haven't fit it into my schedule yet,",,INFO
"but that, I mean, that can really benefit.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Um, that's something that I'd be very interested in, very interested in learning.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"because clothes are s-, are really expensive.",,INFO
"Uh, they're outrageous!",,INFO
"You know,",,INFO
"uh, uh, a little simple shell, shell blouse, you know, that you can make for about, say ten dollars at, you know, at, at the most out of a decent fabric,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"boy, runs you like twenty something dollars in the store.",,INFO
"Yeah it's,",,INFO
"Just a little shell to go under a suit, you know.",,INFO
it's marked up.,,INFO
"It is, it is really outrageous",,CAT
"but, uh, I mean like whenever I, I was growing up and all, my mom,",,INFO
"I never understood this then,",,INFO
"but I do now,",,INFO
"but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars,",,INFO
"or,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"um, or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that",,INFO
and she always told me it was because I was still growing,,INFO
and she wasn't going to buy me something I was going to grow out of next week.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
especially to pay that kind of money for it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I have a friend who, uh,",,INFO
"she had a, she had a ba-, a little boy",,INFO
"and, uh, she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus.",,INFO
"I mean,",,INFO
Oh no,,G_G
"she dressed him, uh, fabulously.",,INFO
"And then, seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And she finally learned that you just can not do this, you know. *",,INFO
"So now she finds the basement sales and, just like, you know, everybody else.",,INFO
That's the best way to shop.,,INFO
"I mean, I always thought my mom was being mean to me",,INFO
but I look back at it now,,INFO
"and my child is going to,",,INFO
"I mean, I'm going to raise mine the same way.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Um, I don't know,",,CAT
"I just, they're just so outrageously priced,",,INFO
it's just incredible.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"and you,",,CAT
"I try to, uh, always catch the sales.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Always,,INFO
"And, yeah,",,CAT
"and you just have to keep buying them, you know.",,INFO
"If you, if you, if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the, the quality is really not that great, you know, for the price that you pay.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it, it depends on, um,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"there's, there's always a reason why they're on sale",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So that, that has a lot to do with it.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"But, um,",,CAT
"well,",,CAT
"Like I bought, I bought the most beautiful swe-, uh, sweater from, uh, I believe it was Ross Dress For Less",,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"And it wa-, it was really pretty,",,INFO
"it was just, you know, it was just plain, a plain, uh, ro-, you know, round, uh, necked, uh, sw-, sweater.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And it had, like, it was embellished around the, the top, you know,",,INFO
"it had, uh, leather, leather designs and, um, some other, other little things on it",,INFO
and I just thought it was so pretty,,INFO
"and I go-, I got it at a real good price,",,INFO
I think maybe it was nine ninety-nine or something.,,INFO
"Oh, that's great.",,G_G
"And it was so pretty,",,INFO
"and after I wore it a couple of times I realized why, why it was,",,INFO
"Uh, oh.",,G_G
it was so cheap.,,INFO
"There was, in the middle of the back of it, there was,",,INFO
"it's like there,",,INFO
it had been slit,,INFO
"and they had like just sewed it back together,",,INFO
"Oh, no.",,G_G
"right in the middle of the back, you know,",,INFO
"wasn't a seam or anything, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"And that's why it was so cheap, although, it's not, it's not really noticeable, uh, from the outside,",,INFO
"but,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"but still, it's, you know, it's really not, not, not a good quality.",,INFO
"And then I was told by somebody that works for J C Penney's that, uh, Ross, Ross is just one of those places that sell, sells seconds.",,INFO
The defect.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"um, they don't really buy the first quality,",,INFO
they buy the second.,,INFO
"And, uh, places like J C Penney's that they'll reject the seconds,",,INFO
they'll send them back every time.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But places like Ross Dress For Less and, uh, T J Max.",,INFO
"T J Max does that,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
yeah,,CAT
we have a T J Max over here,,INFO
"and, um,",,CAT
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
so what kind of cars are you looking at?,,QUESTION
"Well, we've, uh, we've, we've test driven the Oldsmobile Delta Eighty-eight",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac, about three or four years old",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"because, uh, I get married in a couple of weeks",,INFO
and I have two kids,,INFO
and my fiancee has two kids,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
so we need a car that's big enough for six.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"And so we went, I guess it was two weekends ago, we went, uh, car shopping",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and looked around.,,INFO
We found something interesting at Crest Oldsmobile Cadillac up there on Central Expressway,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that, uh, in addition to getting a new car there, they can get you a car that's new",,INFO
"but it's been, uh, a demonstrator model",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
for two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you for a new car.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, they call this program cars,",,INFO
"and they come,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"with a new car warranty,",,INFO
and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
That's a real good deal.,,G_G
"In fact my dad recently got a, um, a Pontiac, uh, believe six thousand",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and he got a demo.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
And it's been a real good car,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and it's, it's like new",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it only had, had very, very low mileage on it.",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
And so I think he got a real good deal.,,INFO
"Of course, they're fully loaded usually.",,INFO
Oh yeah.,,CAT
"So it's, I think it's a pretty good option.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think so too.,,CAT
"Are the, uh, Oldsmobiles that you're looking at, are they the demos",,QUESTION
"or they used,",,QUESTION
are they new,,QUESTION
"Well, the ones that we were test driving were the, uh, were the new ones",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
there.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well now, uh, now, they may be the demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And then the Cadillac is, is definitely a used car",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
The guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes.,,INFO
"He says it'll probably be gone in a done,",,INFO
and it's probably gone by now.,,INFO
Oh no,,G_G
Those things go fast.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, of course we're not, we can't consider getting a brand new Cadillac, because those are twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But when they're three years old they're,",,INFO
the price already drops in half.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So then it becomes, uh, more realistic.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
That's what I'm thinking about on my next car is do I want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"or do I look for a used car that's maybe two, three years old that",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"but that's, you know, low mileage and in good shape.",,INFO
"But I just, I kind of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it.",,INFO
"Is it a lemon,",,QUESTION
or,,QUESTION
That's right.,,CAT
or is something wrong with it,,INFO
but,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
I guess that's a risk you have to take.,,INFO
"Well, you can reduce that risk by, uh, having the car checked out,",,INFO
"I mean, you know, if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but if you've narrowed it down to one or two,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you can have the car, uh, uh, checked at, uh, an independent service station",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong, because they don't have any financial interest in it.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
And then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"About how much do they charge to do something like that,",,QUESTION
do you know?,,QUESTION
"Oh, I'm thinking around twenty or twenty-five dollars.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's not bad.,,G_G
"No,",,CAT
huh-uh.,,CAT
It'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car,,INFO
"I would, I would think so.",,CAT
to find out.,,INFO
I would think so.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Well, it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because I just got mine paid off about a month ago,",,INFO
"and I,",,CAT
Isn't that a good feeling.,,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
I don't want to think about buying a car for a while.,,INFO
I just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and, uh, you know, hang on to the one I've got for a few years because it's, it's, it's almost four years old,",,INFO
but it's still in great shape.,,INFO
I have a Mazda R X seven.,,INFO
"Well, what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years",,COMMAND
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it.,,COMMAND
"Yeah,",,CAT
I just about could really,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"because I think my car,",,INFO
"if I continue taking good care of it, it's going to hold a pretty good resale value",,INFO
Oh yeah.,,CAT
"and, uh, if I consider going the used car route and save up some money, I shouldn't have too much trouble at all.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I would think that's true.",,CAT
Could you hold on for just a moment?,,COMMAND
Sure.,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
"I'm on a cordless phone,",,INFO
"and I was picking up, uh, some background noise,",,INFO
so I just switched the channel up on it.,,INFO
I didn't want to interfere with whatever they're trying to record.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"right,",,CAT
that's fine.,,CAT
Anyway.,,CAT
"But, uh, I really, I really enjoy the car I have now,",,INFO
"and I do want to hold onto it and, and you know, enjoy it while it's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever,",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
in fact it never has,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"and, uh, it's been kind of nice,",,INFO
"and I, surprisingly enough after four years, I'm not tired of the car at all",,INFO
and,,INFO
Well.,,CAT
I want to hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while I'm not tired of it and while I'm single,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and can handle a two seater for now,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
and get that out of my system.,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
Because one of these days I'll be getting a six seater probably too.,,INFO
Eventually.,,CAT
So,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"the first two cars I ever bought, well, uh, uh,",,INFO
"I've bought three cars,",,INFO
and I've always bought them new.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
The first car I kept for thirteen and a half years,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
and got a hundred and sixty-one thousand out of it.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
The second car I ever bought I drive to work now.,,INFO
"That just turned ten years old,",,INFO
and I've got a hundred and twenty-two thousand miles on that.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So that, that's kind of in the way I've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, uh, my car is using two quarts of oil a week now.",,INFO
Oh my gosh,,G_G
"About, about a quart every hundred miles.",,INFO
"Oh, no.",,G_G
"So, but, uh, it runs fine,",,INFO
"all you hav-,",,CAT
it's just very thirsty.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"If I just keep the oil in, it seems to be okay.",,INFO
"But, you know, that's a sign that I'm going to have to do something sooner or later.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
What kind of car is it?,,QUESTION
"It's a, a Buick Century.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Are you going to trade it in on this new one,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"my fiance is selling, uh, a nineteen seventy-eight Cutlass Supreme that she has.",,INFO
"It's actually,",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
in better condition than my car.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And so she's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
to keep the monthly payment low.,,INFO
So she's going to sell it rather than trade it in.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
That's probably the best thing.,,INFO
You lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in.,,INFO
"Or maybe more than that, as I've learned.",,INFO
Oh really.,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"When I bought my R X seven, I, uh, best offer I got for my other car was twenty-five hundred.",,INFO
Well I turned around and sold it myself for forty-two hundred.,,INFO
"So,",,CAT
Oh there you go.,,G_G
You can do much better.,,INFO
"I'm glad you're, you're taking care of it yourself.",,INFO
"I, I think trading it in, they just use that as additional,",,INFO
"they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you're buying,",,INFO
"but they just, are going to give you that much less for your trade in.",,INFO
Well that's fact.,,G_G
What I think.,,INFO
"So,",,CAT
I think you're right.,,CAT
"But strangely enough, the best off-, I mean, the best bargaining I had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place I got the best price",,INFO
Interesting.,,G_G
"trade in,",,INFO
"but it's a place in Arlington,",,INFO
"and I think, maybe, as you get outside the Dallas area,",,INFO
"I kind of,",,CAT
I bet you it's kind of what I decided.,,INFO
"Well, maybe because it's outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better prices,",,INFO
plus I was going through that T I fleet discount program.,,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
"did, did you use it at the car shop place.",,QUESTION
"Well, it's before they had that.",,CAT
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
I had gone over to Texins,,INFO
"and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the, in the fleet program,",,INFO
"That's right,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"and what you could expect, they said, you know, a five percent over cost",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and then options at cost and everything.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So, I figured out a price based on that.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's good.,,G_G
"But I, I guess I got a pretty good deal, because I went back to the Town North Mazda right off Central",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and offered them the same price as what I knew I was going to be able to get it for in Arlington,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price, especially if we add on the equalizer",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and the cruise control.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"He said, You're going to get a car that's got flood damage or hail damage.",,INFO
And they just laughed at me.,,INFO
"And I went the next morning to Arlington,",,INFO
and they gave it to me for that price.,,INFO
"And what's so funny,",,INFO
"they took the car, they, I knew they were going to pull it from Town North because that's where the white one was.",,INFO
Is that right.,,CAT
"And they had already told me, We located one at Town North.",,INFO
So it was that same car.,,INFO
My gosh.,,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage I got the car off your lot for that price",,INFO
And you laughed all the way to the bank.,,QUESTION
Oh I did.,,CAT
And I laughed real hard when I took it in for the two thousand mile checkup,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, that they required you to do.",,INFO
"And I took it to Town North,",,INFO
"and sure enough I saw that guy,",,INFO
and he recognized me.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"He said, Oh, hi, Dana,",,INFO
"and he kind of looked down and saw that car,",,INFO
and I'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"of course, when the place in Arlington went and took the car",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
because I told him there's a place in Arlington that's going to give it to me for that price.,,INFO
"He said, No they're not.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And the next day they pulled the white car and took it to Arlington.,,INFO
So I'm sure he knew,,INFO
Such a deal.,,G_G
So I loved it.,,INFO
"I sat there,",,INFO
and I just had the biggest grin on my face.,,INFO
I'll bet you did.,,G_G
It was kind of nice.,,INFO
"Well, Dana, it's been really interesting,",,G_G
I appreciate talking with you.,,G_G
Yeah.,,G_G
"Good talking to you too, Don.",,G_G
Okay,,G_G
have a good evening.,,G_G
"Okay,",,G_G
good luck in your car hunting.,,G_G
Thank you much.,,G_G
Uh-huh.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"well, what's your opinion about capital punishment?",,QUESTION
"Well, Cathy, I think that, uh, capital punishment certainly has a place in our society, um, maybe from the sense that there are some things that we just can't afford to have repeated, even in the remote chance of repetition.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"I think I would agree with you on that, too.",,INFO
"I, I can't see any point in keeping someone who's obviously beyond any kind of rehabilitation, uh, keeping them, you know, paying for them to live in prison for years and years and years when you could probably just eliminate the problem.",,INFO
Maybe spend the money on someone who could possibly be helped.,,INFO
"That might be true,",,INFO
"um, I'm,",,CAT
"what I don't know, is where do we draw the line.",,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, do we say that every one who commits murder in the first degree is liable for capital punishment if that's what the jury decides is an appropriate punishment for their crime,",,QUESTION
or do we extend it beyond that?,,QUESTION
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
beyond murder or just beyond like first degree murder?,,QUESTION
"Well, either, you know.",,CAT
"Uh, I have a, a nine year old daughter,",,INFO
"and there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even considered capital crimes, that, that I would consider basis for murder.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
well that really gets into a sticky issue.,,INFO
"Uh, I could see that too.",,INFO
"I think there's probably things I could think of short of murder that someone, I think someone would probably deserve to be killed for.",,INFO
"But, gosh,",,G_G
"and who's going to decide which is how bad, you know,",,QUESTION
"something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me,",,INFO
"and, uh, it's gets into a pretty sticky issue.",,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT
it does.,,CAT
"A lot of that has to do with the cultures that we grew up in and what's termed acceptable and, um, to what's allowable and where are we.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, you know, if we were, lived in a different country, then murder is not so bad.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But over here, where we're promised the civil liberties of purs-, life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, then taking that away is a, a heinous act.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
in some eyes.,,INFO
I think some people give up that,,INFO
"I think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges than, than what most people think of them as.",,INFO
"I don't know what, um, Texas's criteria for capital murder is, do, capital punishment is,",,INFO
do you know?,,QUESTION
"Are there some set guidelines, like only under these circumstances?",,QUESTION
I don't know.,,CAT
"I believe it's, uh, at the discretion of the judge or jury.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I used to live in Virginia,",,INFO
"and I know when they first reinstated capital punishment it was only, um, if someone killed a police officer or someone committed rape and then murder.",,INFO
"Those were the only two circumstances where you could give someone the death penalty, which I think is a little too limited.",,INFO
I tend to agree with you there.,,CAT
"Um, my belief is that, is that, um, any crime that's freely committed, you know",,INFO
freedom of choice,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"these people had a choice of committing this crime, that involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"such as rape, deserves punishment by death.",,INFO
But then I'm also told that I'm a pretty harsh person.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"in general terms I'm not so harsh,",,INFO
"but then whenever I hear of a specific case, you know, where someone did something, then it's like, yeah, put it to them",,INFO
"So, I think I probably tend to be a little bit harsh, too, as far as that goes.",,INFO
"Because,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"I think you're right,",,CAT
"that person voluntarily gives up when they decide to commit that crime,",,INFO
"they voluntarily give up their right to continue on with their happy life,",,INFO
"just beca-, you know,",,CAT
they ruin someone else's life.,,INFO
"All right,",,CAT
I can see a difference between a person who goes out to rob a store for food,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"than a person who commits a crime to, either for the thrill of committing the crime or the thrill, the feeling of power that they get from it, or to acquire drugs for some other, I mean acquire funds for some other illegal activity.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, that second group of people falls into the group that I say give up their rights,",,INFO
"the, the first guy, you know I just assumed it was a guy, the first person,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"that went out to rob a store for food, that to me is, is a different set of circumstances, where he, he deserves help instead of, uh, loss of life.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
he didn't go out with the intent of hurting someone else.,,INFO
That's right,,CAT
"or with the,",,CAT
Or with no regard for someone else's well being.,,CAT
"What about, uh, like teenagers that get involved in a gang and do a drive by shooting or something like that. Say fifteen, sixteen year old.",,QUESTION
"Would you consider, uh, capital punishment for them?",,QUESTION
I think I would probably lower the age to about fourteen.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"There's some,",,CAT
"and I, I certainly don't know myself,",,CAT
"but somebody needs to do a study that says at what age true and complete logical thought to include the, the consideration of, of long term consequences",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
begins.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"what age they're accountable,",,INFO
"You know,",,QUESTION
for their actions.,,INFO
"I have an eighteen year old,",,CAT
"and, uh, well he's nineteen now,",,INFO
"and I don't think that I saw it in him until maybe last year,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"And I have an eleven year old and a nine year old,",,INFO
"and I don't, don't see it in them yet,",,INFO
"but I'm, I'm not sure where it begins.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I know that they are lowering the age of, uh, whatever is considered a minor.",,INFO
"I think the kids, certain kids have been tried as adults who were a lot younger than they used to be,",,INFO
"like,",,CAT
"I think I read about a boy that was nine or ten, that got mad at some playmates and went in and got a gun and just opened fire on them,",,INFO
"and they were trying to charge him as a,",,INFO
,,
"What kind, h-,",,QUESTION
"What kind of cars do you, do you usually drive?",,QUESTION
"Right now we, I've got a, uh, four year old Subaru and a two year old Honda.",,INFO
"Oh, my goodness.",,G_G
"Well, we're, we're, we're sort of, sort of a General Motors family,",,INFO
I guess that's the way we were raised.,,INFO
"And, uh, uh, we were overseas with T I for a number of years",,INFO
and when we came back we suddenly find out we've got five licensed drivers in the family.,,INFO
"Oh, goodness.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
and four cars,,INFO
and we bought some year old cars from National Car Rental.,,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
At least two of them.,,INFO
We bought an Olds Calais and a Buick Skylark.,,INFO
"Uh, for, you know,",,CAT
they each had twenty-one thousand miles or something like that.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them,,INFO
and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that.,,INFO
"Uh, then we've got an eighty-six Chevy Spectrum that we bought new.",,INFO
My daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And we've got a eighty-four Toyota that we bought used.,,INFO
So we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers.,,INFO
It's like musical chairs,,INFO
I bet.,,G_G
You're one short.,,INFO
I bet.,,G_G
"And, uh,",,CAT
"but you know, it's interesting the two,",,INFO
even though my dad was a Chevrolet man forever and ever and ever,,INFO
and we were in the retail milk business,,INFO
and he had all Chevrolet milk trucks,,INFO
"and, and we bought automobiles and all that,",,INFO
it was almost like,,CAT
and a Chevrolet dealer was our friend,,INFO
"and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a, but a Chevrolet it would be like going and spitting on his grave",,INFO
"But, uh,",,CAT
Yep.,,CAT
"as we got older and got away,",,INFO
"and then we thought, well, you know, you still could buy General Motors products",,INFO
and it was probably not that bad.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"But, uh, we lived in Malaysia for T I in nineteen, uh, eighty-one, two, three, and four.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, and, of course you don't buy General Motors products over there",,INFO
No.,,CAT
But we bought a Volvo,,INFO
and I have never had a car that I've loved more.,,INFO
I just can't afford them here.,,INFO
"Uh, but I, I just loved that car.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, we bought a, uh,",,INFO
"we lived in the Philippines for T I in eighty-five, eighty-six, and eighty-seven",,INFO
"and we bought a, uh, Ford Telstar,",,INFO
which is somewhat similar to the Taurus.,,INFO
"It's sold in, uh, in uh, the Far Eastern coun-, uh, Far East countries more than here.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
But we really liked that.,,INFO
And have you had experience with cars other than the ones you have?,,QUESTION
"Well, yeah",,CAT
"we had, uh, we had,",,CAT
these are the first cars that my husband and I have ever purchased ourselves.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
The others were hand me downs through the families.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And those were always G M cars.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, Buicks and Chevrolets.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, we were real happy with them,",,INFO
"but all the ones that we ever had were the, you know, eight cylinder,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"really rugged,",,INFO
"The b-, the big,",,INFO
G M cars.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And all we had heard was, was a lot of negative press about the smaller cars,",,INFO
"and we both drive, well, forty-five miles round trip every day.",,INFO
"Sure,",,CAT
sure.,,CAT
"And so we wanted a smaller car,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"when we got ready to buy, we needed a smaller car to get better gas mileage",,INFO
"and quite frankly, we were afraid of the, of the G M small cars.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, as far as durability.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So we kind of,",,CAT
"when we had our larger cars, we didn't mind, uh, keeping them up,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them, all of them, you know,",,INFO
it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
it seems that something goes every month.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"it,",,CAT
"And I'm afraid we're going to be in that in another year with all of ours,",,INFO
"you know,",,CAT
we got three eighty-sixes and an eighty-four,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And we'll probably be there with all of them.,,INFO
"You know, it's the same thing, you know,",,INFO
"I don't know whether, uh, you classify the Skylark and the Calais as,",,INFO
well I guess they're intermediate.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, but, uh, we went on a family trip to Massachusetts",,INFO
and there were five of us,,INFO
"and five, five of us never go anywhere together here.",,INFO
"Every-, everybody's heading off in their own direction.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And I rented a Buick Le Sabre,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and it's the first big car I had since I had my nine passenger Impala station wagon from seventy-six to eighty.,,INFO
"And it made all the,",,CAT
"I, I had forgotten what driving a big car was like.",,INFO
It's like a yacht.,,INFO
It was just nice.,,INFO
It floated.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"What,",,CAT
"we, we sold or we, we traded in our Le Sabre for our Subaru.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
it was a great car.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It just,",,CAT
we ran the wheels right off of it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, you know I've read,",,INFO
"I'm in the quality business at T I,",,INFO
I'm a quality manager,,INFO
"and we're, we're uh, we deal,",,INFO
"we sell,",,INFO
I'm in the semiconductor group,,INFO
"and we sell to, uh, Ford, Chrysler and G M, uh, G M Delco.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And there is a, amazing,",,INFO
"I am just, uh, really impressed with the, with the quality consciousness that the, tho-, these companies have put into their procurement",,INFO
"and it's, I, it's come out as a result of the competition from the Japanese.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, uh, I",,CAT
"and, you know, we used to think Ford products were tinny.",,INFO
"I mean I was growing up,",,INFO
"I was taught when I was growing up, you know, that, that that real people bought General Motors products,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and peons bought,",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
Ford products.,,INFO
But just with the quality requirements that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants,,INFO
"and they're really, uh, uh, stressing this partnerships in quality,",,INFO
"and you know, G M and Chrysler are doing that,",,INFO
"but I really think Ford's got a leadersi-, ship position in this right now.",,INFO
And I think it's showing up in their automobiles.,,INFO
Their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, uh, we went to, uh, Austin a while back to a basketball tournament",,INFO
"and we were going to be meeting some of my wife's relatives down there,",,INFO
"so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down, we'd rent one,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and we went up to the local Budget,,INFO
and we were going to get a Olds eighty-eight or something.,,INFO
"He said I'll tell you what, for a dollar a day more I'll give you a Lincoln Town Car.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
And we drove that down,,INFO
and I hated to turn that back in.,,INFO
I bet,,G_G
We had that for three days.,,INFO
"And I absolutely loved,",,INFO
except I couldn't want to have to park it in tight places all the time.,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"Uh,",,CAT
"I wouldn't want to have to pay for the gas, either.",,INFO
but I absolutely loved that automobile.,,INFO
"And, you know, it wasn't that I'd,",,CAT
"driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon,",,INFO
but on the trip down and back I filled up both coming and going,,INFO
so I knew what I actually got on the trip,,INFO
and it was about twenty-four miles a gallon.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, and, you know, we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it, let it float.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, it was pretty nice.",,INFO
"Are, are,",,QUESTION
.,,CAT
are you planning on getting any additional or other cars?,,INFO
No time soon.,,CAT
"Uh, we're, our, our, we won't have any more licensed drivers for about thirteen years.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Oh, yours is small.",,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"So, we, uh, so we don't plan on purchasing any more any time soon.",,INFO
"Both of our cars are getting,",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"oh, around sixty thousand miles on them.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
We drive a lot.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You got another, another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, we've got,",,INFO
probably we'll get something in the next couple years.,,INFO
"My son will graduate from high school this year,",,INFO
"and, and he's going to go to Richland College one year behind us,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"it's right,",,INFO
"in fact, uh, our house is adjacent to the Richland property.",,INFO
He wants to go to Texas Tech,,INFO
"and he's probably going to have to go to Richland a year to get some grades in order,",,INFO
"but, uh, the next year when he goes out to Tech, he wants a pickup,",,INFO
"and I want,",,INFO
A pickup,,CAT
a pickup.,,INFO
I may get one and not let him have it,,INFO
"But, we have been looking at these red Chevro-,",,INFO
"they, they're very popular around here.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"These, uh, uh, red Chevy pickups,",,INFO
"and, uh, we'll probably do something like that,",,INFO
"uh, uh, incidentally,",,CAT
"uh, uh, I don't know,",,CAT
"uh, the, uh, the Credit Union has got a deal now where you decide what you want",,INFO
and you call this number,,INFO
"and, uh, they go negotiate the price for you.",,INFO
"And, and, or, or send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, my boss just bought a Chevy pickup",,INFO
and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way.,,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, uh, you know, you, you figure out the options, go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and, and tell him what you want",,INFO
"and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy, a certain person at that dealer's place.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So I'm going to try that the next time I buy one.,,INFO
I think that would be a good idea.,,INFO
"And, and, so, you know, I can go around and comparison shop and see if I can get a better negotiation on my own.",,INFO
"But, once, one thing that's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I've, we've, we've, we've kind of been the types that will say, this is what we intend to spend,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"this is the car we want,",,INFO
will you sell me this car for that price.,,INFO
And for that price.,,INFO
"And, and we've had",,CAT
"we, with our,",,CAT
"when we bought our Subaru, the guy was like, you can't do this to me,",,INFO
"and we're were just, like, okay fine, we, we won't then.",,INFO
We'll go somewhere else.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You know.,,CAT
"I mean he's like, no, no, no.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But,",,CAT
"And, uh, and I, I think that's probably the way you've got to do it.",,INFO
"When, when I was young, I went in and bought a, uh, or made a deal on a sixty,",,INFO
"this is nineteen sixty,",,INFO
"I'd first come to Texas, and made a deal on a sixty red Impala convertible",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that I just loved,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and this guy gave me this deal, you know,",,INFO
"I told him how much I wanted to pay,",,INFO
and for every fifty dollars he'd have to go in and check with the boss,,INFO
"and then I'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate, uh, we would go ahead and buy.",,INFO
"Uh, uh, if he could get this rate I promised to buy",,INFO
and I left there on a Saturday afternoon just totally exhausted.,,INFO
"I, I was only twenty-five years old or something",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I, I left there",,INFO
"and I, I, uh, I'd never done this before because I'd always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from,",,INFO
"and, uh, uh, so I, I got back",,INFO
"and a salesman that lived in the apartment had, asked me, uh, uh, if,",,INFO
"he'd heard I was going to get a car, and asked me what I paid for it.",,INFO
"He said, well, hey, uh, before you go buying anything,",,INFO
he says call this friend of mine at Will's Point.,,INFO
There was a guy that owned a Chevrolet dealership up there.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I called the guy and made an appointment to come up Monday morning,,INFO
"and just driving fifty miles out of town, it was a difference,",,INFO
"and, I mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars,",,INFO
"but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty-five hundred,",,INFO
Goodness.,,G_G
is all we paid for cars in those days.,,INFO
"And, uh, uh, so I called back the guy in Dallas",,INFO
"and I told him that,",,INFO
"I'd left him a check for tax, title and license and everything,",,INFO
"and I said I want to cancel my order and, and don't try to cash the check because I'm going to, I've stopped payment on it already",,INFO
"and he says oh, somebody's taking,",,INFO
"he said what did you get a deal for, Bill.",,INFO
"And I told him,",,INFO
"he says, somebody's taking you for a ride.",,INFO
"And I said, no somebody took me for a ride last Saturday",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"And, uh, uh, and I, I find that, uh,",,CAT
and for the longest time then I drove up to Will's Point,,INFO
"and, and the, and the fellow died since then,",,INFO
"and, and some of his relatives have taken over the business",,INFO

"before he moved up to middle school,",,INFO
and it was just packed.,,INFO
"I mean, it was a, a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT

"Uh, so we had to do a bond issue and, and, um, vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that's what the prefer to do, or to, uh, work on the, work for another school to be built, which is a good idea,",,INFO
"but in the meantime, the school still has lots and lots of kids in it.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"So, um, I think one thing is that would,",,CAT

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, my wife teaches kindergarten here in Richardson.",,INFO
"Oh, great.",,G_G
"Uh, but, in general, I, I think the, the, you know, one of the reasons that we, we, uh, the, chose to live in Richardson when we, when we came here was the, was the schools,",,INFO

"We see through the, out the country.",,INFO
"uh, right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"And I think, I think part of that is that, is the, the, uh, a big part of that is just the demographics,",,INFO
"the population in those schools are, are, typically, uh, people that very much value the education and support",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"the, the school systems",,INFO
I think that's right.,,CAT

"but if there was ever any sort of a, uh, if ev-, if I was ever in trouble in school, I was also in trouble at home",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"even more so,",,INFO
"and I think that part of it is, is not exactly with the schools, but with the, with the, uh",,INFO
"The home,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"the culture that doesn't, doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support, uh",,INFO
I think that's right.,,CAT
"what the schools are, are trying to do.",,INFO
"It is so hard with a family system, um, either divorced or, or just one parent",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"or just li-,",,INFO
"and then, if both of them have to work, even that is a, a hard situation",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"for the children, uh, to, to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I think it's real important that the parents work with the school, um",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think what you said is, is really a pinpoint, though, that the student and the family life really adds or detracts",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
what's happening in the school,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"so, um, what about your wife,",,QUESTION
"is she, she happy at school",,QUESTION
or .,,CAT
"Well, uh, she, she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher.",,INFO
I bet she does.,,G_G
"She has, she has two half day classes.",,INFO
So she,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"has, uh, you know, on the order of twice as many students as",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
as the teachers in the higher grades,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"and uh, uh, but her, her background is in, is in, uh, child development, and",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, so forth,",,INFO
"and so kindergarten is as high as she, as she wants to teach,",,INFO
and she's,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"she's teaching rather than something else because that, that, that's the jobs that are available and that, the schedule matches, uh, you know, with our kids and things like that.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So, yeah,",,CAT
"uh, and, but, uh, the ...",,CAT
,,
All right.,,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT
I think we're terribly taxed.,,INFO
"I, I think the Republicans have taxed us just as much as the Democrats,",,INFO
and I don't think there's a change between one party than the other.,,INFO
"Uh, I think we get a lot back,",,INFO
but not as much as we should.,,INFO
"Uh, I guess what I feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it, there's got to be something.",,INFO
"When, when we pay so much for the, for the debt, instead of using the money for where",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"it ought to go, it, it's just, it's ridiculous.",,INFO
"What kills me is when they had a chance to, to, uh, put into ac-, action the, the g-, the Glen-, Rub-,",,CAT
"what is it, uh, the act where they had to cut everything across the board",,QUESTION
"The Gramm, the Gramm Rudman Act.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"they kept doing, they kept putting off doing that.",,INFO
Why did they do that?,,QUESTION
That's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
well I think they spend too much.,,INFO
"They, they spend too much on themselves, too,",,INFO
"the, the,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
I think so too.,,CAT
"A lot of the, the taxes gets back to the members of the Congress and everything all running for twenty years, rather than.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
well. Things like mailings.,,INFO
They don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things.,,INFO
They just think once they get there that they can do just anything.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"they don't, they don't try to, uh",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
you're right.,,CAT
to conserve.,,INFO
"And of course, here at home, we end up conserving and conserving",,INFO
"and, I mean, when I don't have money, I don't buy something.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
no,,CAT
"I think, uh, it is the Congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money, uh,",,INFO
They sure don't seem to.,,CAT
The national debt is terrible.,,INFO
"Uh,",,CAT
"There are a couple of things I think we need to really work for,",,INFO
and I don't know quite how to do it.,,INFO
"But I think we need to have the one line, uh, uh, veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything.",,INFO
If it's a good idea,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
it can be done again.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"You know, and if it's not, so what.",,INFO
At least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months.,,INFO
"I saw one on TWENTY TWENTY about a month ago I guess, whereas one, I think that he was a Senator from Pennsylvania or something like that.",,INFO
"Maybe it was, uh, Connecticut,",,INFO
"I'm not sure,",,INFO
"one of the small states up there, where he had a bill through for another, uh, a drug agency that would be located there,",,INFO
and he was the only one that wanted it.,,INFO
Was going to cost millions of dollars.,,INFO
"The drug agency didn't want it,",,INFO
and he was going to build it in his home town,,INFO
"and they were going to hire a lot of people,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and it was ridiculous, you know, the whole thing",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"this is, that's right.",,CAT
"And, and, you know, they asked him about it.",,INFO
Do you really need this?,,INFO
This is going to cost a lot of money.,,INFO
Oh yes,,INFO
we need it.,,INFO
But do you know that the drug agency doesn't want this?,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And they do things that are, you know, just like the, uh,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
that.,,CAT
"And the trouble is, you don't, you have so little input about it.",,INFO
You don't know,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"enough to know what, what to do about some of this stuff.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"I,",,CAT
"They're supposed to do what we say,",,INFO
"but they do what they, they want to do with it.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's right.,,CAT
"The other thing about is I think, uh, limiting their time in office would be good.",,INFO
"I, I just",,INFO
"Absolutely,",,CAT
absolutely.,,CAT
can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got.,,INFO
We need to get that through.,,INFO
"We, we have said that, I've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two yea-, two terms is enough for all of them.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, whether you're mayor, all the way up, city council, the works, I think. Certainly President, that, uh, two terms is plenty.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I think that's right.,,CAT
"And then we get these professionals out of there,",,INFO
"and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves, you know, rather than",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
wouldn't that be too bad,,INFO
living off of us.,,INFO
"Well, that's right.",,CAT
"I think,",,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"I think, uh, people in general,",,INFO
"the, the, the idea of what you need to, to exist is so outrageous that it's not",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
hardly.,,INFO
"You know, it starts at the courts,",,INFO
it starts everywhere,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"until we can't, we've just lost control of, of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, you know.",,INFO
"Well, it's so much money",,INFO
"and you can't even add it up, you know,",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"you can't even,",,INFO
"that's why they think,",,INFO
can't even conceive of what they're talking about.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
when you talk about the trillions of dollars,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
on this and that.,,INFO
Our national,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"debt in the trillions of dollars, you know.",,INFO
"I mean it jus-, and, and you just,",,CAT
"the other thing is, it's, it's all very well to give money to help people, other people,",,INFO
and I think we need to do that.,,INFO
"But there are, they need to put more limits on them.",,INFO
They need to restrain,,INFO
"Foreign aid,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
about what they do.,,INFO
Foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless it's absolutely,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
necessary.,,INFO
"They, they've given that away for fifty years.",,INFO
"I, I, you know, I think that's probably, un-, unless we can afford it,",,INFO
if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again.,,INFO
"I agree,",,CAT
I agree.,,CAT
"You know, I don't really mind helping people,",,INFO
"but you, you need to get rid of this thing that's, that's just, uh, eating us up",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, and get things on a, on an even,",,INFO
"if it were, if it were a family, we'd be up before the, the magistrate",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"for, for doing all these wicked things, you know,",,INFO
"but the government does it,",,INFO
and it's all right.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I know we're taxed to death on every, every thing.",,INFO
"I don't know what's the best way to do it,",,INFO
"but, uh, they don't even talk about that.",,INFO
They just raise it.,,INFO
"They don't even consider it, like you saying",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"to cut something back, you know.",,INFO
"Well, sounds like.",,CAT
"They are at least doing something now, with the, the military, you know,",,INFO
"they're cutting some of that,",,INFO
"but of course, now, you know T I,",,INFO
"you know that's hurting us but although,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
it's good to see them doing some things there anyway.,,INFO
But T I has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else.,,INFO
"And if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic, uh",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
weapon systems.,,INFO
"But, uh, that's the only good that I've seen Congress do, you know, and everybody",,INFO
Well.,,CAT
"and all the Congressmen and the President and everybody, uh,",,INFO
"I think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens, we're going to have to bite the bullet.",,INFO
And we're all going to have to do it.,,INFO
"I, it just isn't fair, though, that when this happens in some places, it needs to all come off everywhere.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"That's why I thought, well, you know, this is the time.",,INFO
"They need to put that into act-, into action and show they mean business. That they've got to cut, they've got to cut costs.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"The only taxes I think that are well spent,",,INFO
"well not the only, but, uh,",,CAT
"I think the, now I, I don't understand the present school thing,",,INFO
"but, uh, I have two daughters,",,INFO
"one's in college already,",,INFO
and one's about to be in high school.,,INFO
"But uh, I think that paying for school, schools is the, schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime.",,INFO
And so I don't mind paying for school,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think that's right.,,CAT
"taxes even though my kids will be out of it, you know.",,INFO
"Well, I don't, I don't really mind paying taxes for, for positive things that are helps, like roads and",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"making sure that, uh, that water is safe, and some of these things.",,INFO
"But, um, you know, it, you just feel like it's out of control.",,INFO
You feel like,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
they do not have control of it.,,INFO
The spending is out of control.,,INFO
"And that, and so then it just aggravates you, you know,",,INFO
"you think, I could spend my money,",,INFO
I could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"oh, I agree with you.",,CAT
"So it's,",,CAT
"I, I think that's a wide open subject",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
what you said.,,INFO
People need to take a stand.,,INFO
"I think the people will here shortly, uh.",,INFO
"Well, I think that's right.",,CAT
"If they don't do, if they don't, if they don't pull it in and start doing something, I think they're really going to have to I think.",,INFO
"I think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out, too, that, what they did last election,",,INFO
"and, uh, ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in, you know,",,INFO
"so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes, you know.",,INFO
They're supposed to represent us.,,INFO
That's what they're called,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
but they don't.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"May, may, may, maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there, guys and gals whatever they are.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
in some ways we're awful lucky I guess.,,INFO
"There a lot of, lot of places where it's worse than it is here.",,INFO
But,,INFO
"I know,",,CAT
but it.,,CAT
"still, you don't want it to get that bad, good heavens.",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"that's right,",,CAT
"you don't want to,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be.,,INFO
"we need to get, try to get hold of it and, and have it be, things be honest",,INFO
"and, I guess, in the fact I don't really mind paying taxes.",,INFO
But I would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent. That they're doing something that's positive for,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
for somebody.,,INFO
"I don't really feel like, uh, I don't really feel like I use taxes very much",,INFO
I don't know,,CAT
maybe,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's, you're right.",,CAT
"I do more than I,",,INFO
I guess I do.,,INFO
"I use them in the, in roads and lot of things,",,INFO
"but, uh.",,CAT
"Well I think one of the good ones in the metroplex, uh, in the last say twenty-five years or so, maybe longer, they've built all these dams.",,INFO
"You know, the Corps of Engineers have, uh, soon as they finish a lake, they'll go at, get another one.",,INFO
"And that we haven't had, we've had droughts here in long summers",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"we've had good water supply,",,INFO
"and that's due to the Corps of Engineers building, looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us, you know.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
they've done some good things.,,CAT
"The state actually did some good, good work on that, in that a couple of years ago.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, Sam Johnson came out and talked to us about that",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
about what they had done.,,INFO
"And they, they really had done some good, some good work.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think anything for water supply like that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
California should do more of that too.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"there are a lot of p-, places where they're in real trouble,",,INFO
and,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and I think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too, if they don't take, if they don't take that early stand.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"They just finished Joe Poole Lake over here,",,INFO
and they need to start another one.,,INFO
I think every time they finish one they ought to just have,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
another one in line.,,INFO
The water's critical.,,INFO
that's probably right.,,CAT
The growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait until something,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
til they need them.,,INFO
"Well, it's good to talk to you.",,G_G
"Okay,",,G_G
yeah.,,CAT
How many calls have you made?,,G_G
"Oh, about nine.",,G_G
"Oh yeah,",,G_G
I'm up to twenty.,,G_G
Are you a T I -er.,,G_G
"No,",,G_G
"I just, just a housewife.",,G_G
I just heard about it and found it fun,,G_G
"Oh, well, great,",,G_G
"great,",,G_G
okay.,,CAT
"Guess I like to talk, that's all",,G_G
"Well, it's been some interesting subjects,",,G_G
yeah.,,G_G
Right.,,G_G
Thanks for calling.,,G_G
Uh-huh.,,G_G
Bye now,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
Now then I think that,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
are you there?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
I'm here.,,INFO
All right.,,CAT
Do you have any one that has been in a nursing home?,,QUESTION
"Uh, well, only my, um, my grandmother, but for a very short time.",,INFO
"Um, she, uh, she was just more or less in a, in a nursing home for, uh, recovery from a broken hip",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
because she could receive more medical attention.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"But, um, that,",,CAT
"physical therapy was there and whatever,",,INFO
"but I think, in visiting her there, um, it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in, uh, weren't there mentally.",,INFO
"Uh, she was probably the only person in the, um, whole nursing home that, uh, still had all of her mental facilities about her.",,INFO
"So that was, uh, that was very disheartening.",,INFO
"Well, what do you think can be done about that?",,QUESTION
"I mean, what can we do,",,QUESTION
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"it's really hard, I guess.",,INFO
"I, I come from a family of, um, of, uh, take care of your elders, I guess.",,INFO
"Uh, my, my dad's mother is an invalid,",,INFO
"and she lives with my aunt and uncle,",,INFO
"and they care for her, you know, all around the clock.",,INFO
"Though she's not, uh, she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention, she, because of arthritis, she's just unable to get out of bed.",,INFO
"So, I guess, you know, there's that family commitment.",,INFO
"Um, I know that my parents, my mother is trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can. Um,",,INFO
"Well, I can remembe-,",,CAT
of course I'm,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
old enough to remember when the family or the church took care of all of this.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"We did not have to call on, on someone else,",,INFO
"and I feel,",,INFO
"no, you tell me how you feel about,",,COMMAND
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well probably, I think, as long as the person's able to, um, to understand what's going on around them",,INFO
"and I think, you know, my grandmother right now is still able to walk around,",,INFO
"and she's still able to, uh, to do some things for herself, though she gets Meals On Wheels",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"which I think is a great thing, because, um, it saves people from having to prepare food for her, because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on, or whatever, although she does most things very well, it still makes a little bit easier for her.",,INFO
"Certainly d-,",,CAT
Uh.,,CAT
"I worked with an agency in West Texas that they, it's where they really started this concept of Meals On Wheels",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"If they didn't have to, you know, go into a kitchen",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"my mother expired just, just a little over a year ago,",,INFO
"and we had finally,",,INFO
she didn't want to live with either my sister or me,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but we, we got, found a retirement center for her,",,INFO
and it was beautiful,,INFO
"and they had all these, they didn't even have nursing care there.",,INFO
"So until,",,CAT
"as long as mother was, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
mobile and,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"got her food,",,INFO
and she was with people with whom she enjoyed.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that,",,CAT
"I think, you know, it's really funny,",,INFO
"I have two grandmothers still alive,",,INFO
and my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible.,,INFO
She's like openly told people.,,INFO
"She's always been very good about knowing,",,INFO
"yes, she's eighty-nine,",,INFO
"and she said that she would really like to stay in her house as long as possible, because it's her home.",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"But when the time comes, um, she, and she can't do things",,INFO
"and she has to be cared for, whatever, she would prefer, and she's actually said this, to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment, uh, probably with like a living space and a bedroom",,INFO
"Yes, sir.",,G_G
"with maybe a kitchenette, so that if she, you know, if she wants to fix herself something light, she can do that,",,INFO
"but if she wants to go to a meal, she can go down the hallway, uh, to a room where there's a cafeteria",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and there's other people there,",,INFO
and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company.,,INFO
Being a widow,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I find that eating alone is one of the hardest things,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
I have to do.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I have just recently retired,",,INFO
and I am finding it extremely hard to adjust to.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So, uh, mother had the little kitchenette",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and she could do all these fine things that she just, ha-, had a microwave, had to pop",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
her popcorn.,,INFO
Now this is wonderful.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But when it came time for a full meal, then mother was able to go with people",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"and, and enjoy.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think, I think that probably, until, until they're really invalids, uh, the elderly are invalids, I think that they should be able to interact with other people",,INFO
"Oh, I think so.",,CAT
"in an environment that they choose, if they can, if the family can afford it.",,INFO
Well.,,CAT
"I mean, um, see, I know that my grandmother would like to stay in her house,",,INFO
"and my parents actually said, you know, that they may have to take their end, sometime, so, because, you know, my grandma, she says who she wants to live with,",,INFO
"she's pretty, you know,",,INFO
"she lets people know,",,INFO
,,
"Well let's see, um,",,CAT
"I, I like to go out to eat,",,INFO
"I really do,",,INFO
"but being from Dallas, um, I think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open and close every we-, month",,INFO
"and we ave-, we have a really high turn over rate.",,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
Oh yeah,,CAT
"and, and this is, I mean there are streets just called restaurant rows",,INFO
"and, uh, you can get everything here from, um, a very spicy Indian meal to, you know, the favorite barbecue and, and, uh, just anything your little hearts desires around here,",,INFO
"so, here they have to entertain us to make us come back.",,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"And I guess it's all one big game because you, you just never run out of places to go,",,INFO
you really don't.,,INFO
That's good.,,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
"I never really thought about that,",,INFO
"but, uh, a good turn over would be sort of nice.",,INFO
"Course if you find a place you like and it works out that no one else likes it, it would be sort of sad to see it go under.",,INFO
Really,,CAT
"and, and we go to, you know, like an older part of town",,INFO
"and we just notice how many, oh well",,INFO
"that restaurant's changed,",,INFO
"and oh, gee, there, they've changed",,INFO
"and, oh, we've got to go try that one, you know,",,INFO
"and it's, it's really,",,CAT
"you have the pick of the, you know, the crop here.",,INFO
"Are they big into am-, ambiance down there",,QUESTION
"or is it more like,",,QUESTION
Oh!,,CAT
"uh, Texas to me makes",,INFO
it seems like it would be portions would be the big thing.,,INFO
"You know, your, your fourteen ounce steak with your potato and stuff.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"right,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, you can get that too.",,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"they've got everything here from the, uh, French Room which is ultra, ultra to, um, um, Dean Ferrings , uh, uh, restaurant which is the Mansion on Turtle Creek.",,INFO
I mean we've got beautiful places to go.,,INFO
"You can get as dressed up or, a-, you know just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, you know I guess, uh, some of the foods that we really enjoy though are the, um, um, like Chinese,",,INFO
Um,,CAT
and we're always searching around for Chinese.,,INFO
"And now, of course, they've added the Taiwanese,",,INFO
"and, and, um, uh, various, you know, any, any part of the country you want to hit, they have got it.",,INFO
"I mean, Vietnamese restaurant we went to, you know, last week. It's great,",,INFO
"it's good stuff, you kno-,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, uh, it's, so it's very, very mixed",,INFO
"and, uh, you know, I think if you like food like we do,",,INFO
"I, I don't know if that happened before or after we moved here",,INFO
"but, um,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, you get a lot of, uh, great variety of things here,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"But if you were going to a restaurant, say, um, where would you go?",,QUESTION
"Oh, well we had, uh, we have a lot of favorites here, uh, in Northern Virginia",,INFO
"and of course we've got D C to call on, you know,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and there's all sorts of things down there.,,INFO
"One thing about D C is that there are a lot of traditional restaurants where, you know, it's, the guy used to be the cook for the Capitol",,INFO
"and so he stays in the same restaurant for twenty years, you know,",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
and he's got a big clientele,,INFO
"and, um, so there are, there are some hang outs where you can go if you want to see people.",,INFO
"You know, it's, it's sort of like Hollywood in a way because there's, there's favorite haunts for Southerners and things like that.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"Um, we don't hang around with them, because usually it's, you know, ninety dollars a plate or something silly like that.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right,,CAT
"So, uh, but, uh, my wife has a, a friend that w-, runs one of the restaurants down there",,INFO
"and we've been down there and had French cuisine,",,INFO

I think so,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT

"during the summer,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"and then, I don't know. We just have an awful lot of engagements,",,INFO
"and we're just having to turn a lot of people down, um, because, you know, uh, we don't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row.",,INFO

It really depends on who shows up.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT

"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"I think it's, you know what's I think is so nice is that in this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you",,INFO

Yeah.,,CAT
"And,",,QUESTION
"Preparing it,",,INFO

that's what I think too.,,INFO
"I don't know how you feel, um,",,CAT
we moved here from another state.,,INFO
"We lived here before, went out and came back,",,INFO
"and that particular state had an occupational income tax, but no sales tax.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And what you find out is, there's, one evil is the same as the other.",,INFO
"Here you don't, there's no occupational tax",,INFO
but it's a heavy sales tax.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So they get you coming and going.,,INFO
"Now it's even, it's even higher in Dallas County,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
Was it. *,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it's really, I know, it's just, um.",,CAT
It's eight and a quarter I think.,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
it is.,,INFO
I was shocked.,,INFO
"I went,",,INFO
we bought a new washer,,INFO
"and the man said, and that's eight percent.",,INFO
"I said, eight percent. What ?",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So it's really kind of sad,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"And then I don't know how, you know, in terms of when you all do your federal,",,CAT
"but it just seems like, if you're strictly middle income, it seems like you get hit the worst.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Is that what you think?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"because it's, at some point it goes up to thirty-three percent",,INFO
"and then the people that make, you know, five hundred thousand dollars and, and, and higher than that, they don't have to pay,",,INFO
and sometimes they have to pay even less taxes.,,INFO
"Doesn't seem quite fair, does it?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
it isn't.,,INFO
Because they have the money to shelter things,,INFO
"and, I don't know, somehow get a, huh",,CAT
What?,,CAT
"Oh, I thought you were going to say something.",,QUESTION
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"They somehow seem to get around these,",,INFO
"the things that we can't, you know,",,CAT
"that make, don't make that kind of money.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
I don't know.,,CAT
"I mean, if they're in business, and, and they're making money,",,INFO
"I could see if they're losing money,",,INFO
but they're making money,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
then they should pay taxes then.,,INFO
"I know,",,CAT
"and just somehow it doesn't seem, you know,",,INFO
"and then, I, you",,CAT
"mean you look at like, uh, that country singer, uh, what's his name, Willie Nelson.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I was reading about him in the paper and I said, Well, you know, he knew he was making money. *",,INFO
"Some, he didn't look that stupid.",,INFO
Why didn't he pay his taxes? You know. *,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"In a way, it's almost like he had so much debt that, uh, filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
you know.,,INFO
"So. Do you file federal or joint income tax,",,QUESTION
or do you? *,,CAT
I just file federal income tax every year.,,INFO
"And do you feel like you get hit by, you know, too much?",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I just got divorced,",,INFO
so I'm single again.,,INFO
"So, and you know, it's, it's a lot worse for single people, because they pay the same amount as, as the people that make the same amount of money and they're married.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And we, right now, we don't own any property.",,INFO
We lease.,,INFO
"So we're in the same,",,INFO
"we don't have children,",,INFO
"so we're in the same kind of,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"it's not as bad as being single and divorced,",,INFO
"but it's sort of like, if you have like X point five children and earn, you know, you kind of get hit with, you know,",,INFO
"I, I mean, it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage, because,",,INFO
doesn't that sound stupid.,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, I mean, there's actually less tax implication if I don't work full time compared to what my husband does, you know. *",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
So it's kind of hard.,,INFO
"Whoever works less, they can get a tax credit for that.",,INFO
Excuse me.,,CAT
"If both of the, both of the spouses",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"work, then you get a tax credit for that.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"otherwise you're just, you know,",,CAT
"and if you have kids, you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or something",,INFO
"Well, it's two thousand now.",,INFO
"Oh, it is.",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
for everybody.,,INFO
"Oh, my.",,G_G
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Well that's not too bad.,,INFO
"Then you get a, you get a child care exemption,",,INFO
"but it's not enough, you know.",,INFO
"I mean, you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, and they only give you like, I think it's about five or ten percent of that.",,INFO
"Oh, my goodness.",,G_G
"You know, it doesn't even, it's not even,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I guess that's my call.,,INFO
I guess I better go,,G_G
"Oh, okay.",,G_G
"Okay,",,G_G
well it was nice talking to you.,,G_G
Nice talking to you.,,G_G

"We're, we're at the point now,",,INFO
"I go-, I quit working about six months ago to start this house",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I'm out of cash,,INFO
and I'm not out of project yet.,,INFO
"Oh, no.",,G_G
"So, uh, I'm going to go back and do some consulting work.",,INFO
"As far as budget's concerned, I'm, I'm fairly fortunate.",,INFO
"Uh, we've, we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra, we can make it on what my wife makes.",,INFO
"So, you know, the project's kind of halted until then.",,INFO
"But as far as budgeting is concerned, you know, we have, uh, some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, you know,",,INFO
"we always put ten percent back,",,INFO
and that's a never touch.,,INFO
"Uh, into savings.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
"Either savings or investment, one of the two,",,INFO
but we don't ever put it in a high risk.,,INFO
It's just always going to be there.,,INFO
"Well, that's pretty good.",,G_G
"And as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, uh, what I would call extravagant expenses, you know,",,INFO
"we, uh, we pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, you know, just travel to and from work and clothing and food",,INFO
"Boy, that's pretty good.",,G_G
"and the rest of it, you know, we pile into the house.",,INFO
"And, uh, you know, I'm fairly fortunate.",,INFO
"I mean, our credit cards are out to the max right now because I'm",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"a little behind on that,",,INFO
"but, uh, we're still making the payments on them.",,INFO
"It's just, when you,",,INFO
see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
and do it yourself.,,INFO
"it's, it's tough here too.",,INFO
You have to have the contractor sign with you.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
But it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
", where I live, that is.",,INFO
"And where I live, it, it's pretty scary, because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and you screw up, you don't get it finished,",,INFO
the bank can eat the contractor.,,INFO
"Oh, bad for him, huh.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
bad for him.,,INFO
"But, the homeowner can't be touched.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
It's a homestead state.,,INFO
Is that right?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"see right now if I quit paying any of my bills,",,INFO
the only thing they could do is cut off electricity.,,INFO
They can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes. Period.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"You know. They can take your car and your clothes and your, anything",,INFO
"that's not the tools of your trade,",,INFO
"but as far as, uh, you know you're pretty much bullet proof in this state.",,INFO
"Well, that's kind of handy.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I just finished James Michener's TEXAS book.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Pretty interesting.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Texas has quite the history.,,INFO
"Well, you know, we're, we're not ones to budget much, you know",,INFO
.,,CAT
We just going to spend it all.,,INFO
That's kind of what we do.,,INFO
"We, uh, we're L D S",,INFO
and so we pay ten percent,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
tithing,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and then, you know, we put I guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
But that sometimes we use for emergency type things.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, and my wife doesn't work.",,INFO
"We're fortunate that way, that I make enough to do what we want to do.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"we're pretty, pretty fortunate as far as the, uh, the budgeting is concerned, because, you know, we don't have any long term debt.",,INFO
"You know, uh, we paid cash for car.",,INFO
"Well, we bought the car on time, one of them,",,INFO
"but we, you know, we since paid it off.",,INFO
Well that's pretty.,,G_G
"The land is paid for cash,",,INFO
so we don't have to worry about that.,,INFO
That's a great position to be in.,,G_G
"Well, it's fraught with other problems",,INFO
Is that right?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
I'm not very motivated,,INFO
Oh,,CAT
What kind of consulting do you do?,,QUESTION
"Uh, systems consulting. Computerization for construction firms.",,INFO

"This guy's place burned down,",,INFO
"and he had a bunch of computer stuff,",,INFO
"and, you know, I bought it all.",,INFO
It was two hundred bucks for everything he had.,,INFO
You got a buy.,,G_G
"Well, some of it wasn't worth anything, you know.",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"You know, a lot of the, uh, diskettes were just totally unusable.",,INFO
"Melted, or Just wet",,INFO
"or,",,CAT
"Well, yeah",,CAT
", or wet",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"But I did get out of there with, uh, Vermont Views, which is a huge,",,INFO
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"uh, so what do you think about the school system?",,QUESTION
"Well, I think they're, they're having a lot of trouble right now.",,INFO
"I know my son goes to a private school,",,INFO
"but, uh, I think they're, big city public schools by definition are having a, a tough time right now just from, uh, probably from budget cuts and, and everything else going on.",,INFO
"Uh, why did you choose a private school?",,QUESTION
"Well, I had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a, at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school,",,INFO
so,,INFO
Public school.,,CAT
"he's, he has been going to private since kindergarten",,INFO
"Oh, has he?",,QUESTION
"So,",,CAT
Then how does he like it?,,QUESTION
"Oh, he's loved it.",,INFO
He is a senior in high school this year,,INFO
so,,CAT
So,,QUESTION
"he's,",,INFO
he's been there all the time.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"he's done it the whole twelve and, uh, so many years",,INFO
"and it's been, uh, it's been really good for him.",,INFO
How big of a school is it?,,QUESTION
"Uh, overall on campus about twelve hundred, but in the upper school, upper four grades, uh, about four hundred and something",,INFO
so it's maybe a hundred per grade.,,INFO
"A hundred per grade, that's a good size.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
it really is.,,CAT
"Kind of gives them the, you know,",,INFO
I get a little leery of the real small ones that they don't get much interaction with kids,,INFO
"but, uh,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that was, we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture",,INFO
and,,INFO
"So they don't,",,CAT
"he's done, he's done",,INFO
That's good.,,G_G
"really well,",,INFO
"and just, he was just ahead at an early age",,INFO
"and I didn't feel like, uh, in, what was available, particularly in the first three grades",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
And I just didn't think that was going get it.,,INFO
"I thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead, uh, every day.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
But yet still be with his peers,,INFO
"Still enjoy the,",,CAT
age wise.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, one thing I think I've noticed is, uh, my oldest is in kindergarten,",,INFO
so I'm in a little different,,INFO
You're just,,INFO
ballgame.,,INFO
getting started.,,INFO
"I'm just,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"starting her,",,INFO
"but, uh, seems to me that, uh, kids these days, uh, can really get away with murder",,INFO
"and the teachers don't have as much, aren't respected as much",,INFO
"and, uh, they have to be so careful of the things they do and say.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I know.,,CAT
That's,,INFO
"And, uh, makes me",,INFO
a big problem.,,INFO
"a little nervous that, uh, students don't seem to show that respect",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
We wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we,,INFO
No!,,CAT
were in school.,,INFO
"Heavens,",,G_G
no.,,CAT
Wouldn't have thought of it,,INFO
and,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
you wouldn't.,,CAT
and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"And, uh, the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what I understand, uh,",,INFO
I think that's wrong.,,INFO
"I think we need to get back to the, show some respect",,INFO
"and, course, I guess the teacher used to warrant that",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"anymore like it used to be, basic respect for",,INFO
For other people,,INFO
for elders,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"and adults and particularly in, in responsible positions have not, uh, I don't think have, had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases",,INFO
and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands.,,INFO
"Well, how do you think that that's happened?",,QUESTION
"You think our society's just, uh, stopped talking out,",,INFO
"or this, uh",,INFO
"I guess, I,",,CAT
"generation's just kind of changed a little bit, uh,",,INFO
"Well, the world changes,",,INFO
"so I mean, obviously, kids are not the same now as they used to be.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
I mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things.,,INFO
"They have a whole lot more, uh, variety of things they they're, that they see and do at an earlier age,",,INFO
"so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time,",,INFO
"but, but still, I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to, to teach, uh, basic values and basic, uh, respectful of, uh, -ness of authority.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
And I just don't think that this,,INFO
That just isn't coming through,,INFO
doesn't always get emphasized,,INFO
is it.,,INFO
"anymore, uh,",,INFO
No.,,CAT
"I mean, I remember, uh, well, it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi's.",,INFO
We used to have to wear,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
had to wear,,QUESTION
dresses,,INFO
"dresses, didn't you?",,INFO
"and then you had to, a-, go to dresses,",,INFO
they had to be a pantsuit,,INFO
and it was polyester,,INFO
and it had to be matching,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"And when it was skirts, it was like, get down on the floor",,INFO
and we hold the ruler up here,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
and it's no,,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
more than so many inches above the knee,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
Because it was mini skirt time back there at one time.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
so it's really changed.,,INFO
"It's, uh, really kind of gone the rounds,",,INFO
so I think that maybe that's effected it to some degree.,,INFO
"They say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit,",,INFO
"so I,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think that probably does have, have something to do with it,",,CAT
"and it's also,",,CAT
"Do, uh, does this school your son goes to, do they, uh, re-, require to wear a uniform",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"they do not do uniforms, although one, where he was between like second and eighth grade",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
did.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"there are quite a few of your s-,",,CAT
,,
"Okay, Eric.",,CAT
"Uh, are you married",,QUESTION
and do you have a family?,,QUESTION
"Uh, yes I am to, uh, both questions.",,CAT
Okay,,CAT
and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances.,,QUESTION
"Uh, yeah",,CAT
we do.,,INFO
"We, uh, uh,",,CAT
"basically there's the, you know, the expenses that are fixed during the month",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know the ones that come every, every month",,INFO
"and we, uh, enter those into, uh, into a spread sheet",,INFO
"and, uh, whatever is left, uh, after that we,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"you know, we sit down and agree on kind of what, what sort of range we are going to",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
generally going to shoot for.,,INFO
I see. Uh,,CAT
So what do you do?,,QUESTION
"Well, that's basically what we do.",,INFO
"Uh, about every, every three months or so, we re-evaluate our budget",,INFO
and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks.,,INFO
I work part time at night,,INFO
Wow,,G_G
"and he works, and my husband works full times days",,INFO
"and so we have four checks,",,INFO
but that works out nice because we get paid every week,,INFO
and,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"so that does help,",,INFO
.,,CAT
that helps a lot.,,INFO
"And then, uh, we don't have a lot ex-, extra for extra spending,",,INFO
.,,CAT
so it's pretty well ear marked.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
All allocated out.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Every penny is ear marked,,INFO
"but, uh it, we have found that works the best",,INFO
"and and so if we can just divide them up, all the major bills up.",,INFO
"In fact, we found it easier to divide the major bills up, you know, cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half,",,INFO
"but and divide those up between all,",,INFO
uh-huh.,,CAT
"All the checks,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"And so we are not taking a huge sum out, out of one",,INFO
and then the next pay check we're real short,,INFO
"or,",,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"we found that, uh,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"it's definitely helped, uh, get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses.",,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
"We were, before we started doing that kind of a thing, we were, uh, spending, uh, money for things that, you know,",,INFO
we kind of tended to eat out a bit more,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"than we should have,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and it was easy to, uh, let things get out of hand.",,INFO
"We thought it uh, thought it to be really helpful.",,INFO
We have gotten some of our loans paid off really,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
because of this and stuff like that,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Well, it helps you to focus where your money goes",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"and and I am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget,",,INFO
"but you're wondering my, when you put down all the money that you do bring in",,INFO
"and then you're saying, my word where did all that money",,INFO
"That's a lot of money,",,INFO
but,,CAT
go.,,INFO
Where does it go?,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Uh,,CAT
"But,",,CAT
"and also we have found that if we write down,",,INFO
and we did this.,,INFO
"We are not real consistent with this,",,INFO
but we did it for about a month,,INFO
"and we wrote down everything that we bought when, you know, every pay check",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and so we could see where every penny went,,INFO
and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend,,INFO
and like I say we haven't been real consistent with it.,,INFO
"It's,",,CAT
we should cause it does help.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"the other, the other thing that that we've found that helps is, you know, we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"it's just to, uh, uh, get up the money in advance and put it in, uh, uh, so long as it wasn't you know, unreasonably high, but for things like food expenses",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
or whatever. Just put it in uh,,INFO
.,,CAT
in an envelope or whatever,,INFO
"and that way it kind of forced us to, uh, stick to that amount. * Should end with a slash. This is an independent clause, as is B's next turn.",,INFO
"Wel-, just stick to that,",,INFO
uh-huh.,,CAT
"That is,",,CAT
"And then once that was gone, well * should be start of a new slash unitsee B.58 utt2",,CAT
.,,CAT
if the entertainment amount was gone,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
That,,INFO
"for the month say, oh, it's gone",,INFO
that sounds like a really good idea.,,INFO
So.,,CAT
And it really helpful.,,INFO
"Uh, have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet?",,QUESTION
"We, we haven't.",,CAT
"We our our initial goal was just to retire debt, uh, completely retire debt for car payments and",,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
credit card,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, credit card debt and all of that.",,INFO
"We are just at a point where, where we could start thinking about it",,INFO
so,,CAT
Oh that's good.,,G_G
That's a good feeling,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT

I don't know,,CAT

seems to me.,,INFO
"Well,",,CAT
I guess I'm like my parents.,,INFO
"The younger generation gets away with hell,",,INFO
"but, uh,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT

"I think,",,INFO
"you know, uh, as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do.",,INFO

"I think it's,",,CAT
"crime has gone, got a lot worse in the last",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
I agree.,,INFO
"last ten, fifteen years,",,INFO
and maybe that has a lot to do with it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT

to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,G_G

"That's true,",,G_G
"But, uh,",,CAT

Yeah.,,CAT
I think.,,INFO
"It's, uh,",,CAT
It's hard for me to say.,,INFO

around that we could find and put them in,,INFO

Uh.,,CAT
"and then, you know, they have someone that comes around and pick it up, you know, every afternoon",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's neat.,,G_G
"which, you know, is an excellent idea,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
at work because I know the amount paper they go through there,,INFO
"because,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's right.,,CAT
"I guess one of the things, I think, that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"about it,",,INFO
"there's needs to be more public, uh,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I would agree with that.,,CAT
"service of, programs or something that would let us know had a happens to it",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening,,INFO

really,,INFO
"and I, I think that's a shame",,INFO

Exactly.,,CAT
"can you put all together or,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"is there some reason not to,",,INFO
"uh, now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use,",,INFO
I don't know,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but I, I'd be glad to organize it,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
if that they'd tell me what it is I'm doing,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"because that would, that would be really helpful. *",,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"I agree with you there,",,CAT
"another thing that I like here which is,",,CAT
"I do with,",,CAT
"I have to actually go to two different recycling areas because one of them is that, uh,",,INFO
"their aluminum cans is for, uh, Children's Hospital, for a burn fund",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"so all the monies are donated, you know,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"for the recycling to Children's Hospital, which I think is an excellent idea,",,INFO

that's great.,,G_G
"there, you know, because the other,",,INFO
"Now that gives,",,INFO
"public,",,INFO
you a little bit of incentive there.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"right,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and before even at work,",,CAT
"before they started the recycling plan, which at work they've only been doing since January first of this year, I had had everyone in my department recycling",,INFO
"and, you know, I would have them drop,",,INFO

"right, drop their cans off in my office",,INFO
"and then I would haul them, you know, here to this place for the Children's Hospital Fund",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"which got people really going into it,",,INFO
"I think that's,",,G_G
"but,",,CAT
right.,,INFO
"I think, I think helping us be more enthu-, enthusiastic about it,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"helping us maybe, maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
*,,CAT
"That,",,CAT
there you go.,,CAT
Making sure *,,CAT
That's for sure.,,CAT
"But I, I think that's",,CAT
"right I think they, there needs to be a little bit more in the area of, of, uh, ad-, advertisement,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and letting, public letting you understand,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"more of what it is you're doing, why you're doing it, how you're it's done and,",,INFO

right.,,CAT

Right.,,CAT
"and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT

and I freeze two containers of it.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
Then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice.,,INFO
But neither of my kids will eat it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know,",,INFO
so then,,INFO
"So it,",,CAT
they eat a pizza or,,INFO

"But, my kids love it.",,INFO
"I was going to say, my kids both eat it.",,INFO
"I guess that's one thing that I particularly like, um.",,INFO
"But I think it's good for, you know, for, for company, too,",,INFO
and I've made it a few times.,,INFO
"Um, and you can make a lot at one time",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"when I needed to make something to, uh, to give somebody.",,INFO

"And you sprinkle, uh, that, those, uh, toasted onion rings.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,G_G
Those are good aren't they?,,QUESTION
On top of it for the crunchy.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And that's it, you know",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"And it, it, it goes",,INFO
That sounds good.,,G_G
and it's filling because of the rice.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
You cook the rice before you put it in?,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really, kind of gives it a",,INFO

that cholesterol fat free?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
That's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"new things like that because like I told my husband this summer, I love to eat, you know, chicken salad and tuna salad",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and stuff like that,,INFO

I know.,,CAT
"You know and now it's, it's, it's okay",,INFO
"and you can even,",,INFO
I used to just put a tiny bit in.,,INFO
"Well now, I'm just putting more and more in",,INFO
I don't like tuna salad unless it's got lots of mayonnaise in it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and it's only, it used to be like a hun-, hundred calories per tablespoon",,INFO
and now it's like twelve.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Oh!,,G_G
I know.,,CAT
"I just think that's the best thing to have happened,",,INFO
I'm just so excited about that.,,INFO
Anyway,,CAT

we did the low-cal stuff.,,INFO
"Well with my kids I don't,",,INFO
they get enough sugar and,,INFO
Yeah.,,INFO
stuff anyway.,,INFO
Mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway.,,INFO
Yes,,CAT
And they don't need any added help.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"So, when we're here at home, you know, with sweets and stuff, they, they don't, we don't really do that much.",,INFO
I do a lot of fruits,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
instead of the cakes and the candies and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, stuff like that.",,INFO
"And, and drink wise they have Kool-Aid, milk or water.",,INFO

Oh really?,,QUESTION
Have you ever found out,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
about your kids.,,INFO
not yet.,,CAT
"Um, and my other one does not.",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"So, oh, year or so ago he found out",,INFO
and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down. And did!,,INFO
He was able to get it down.,,INFO
"It's, I think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
things in cholesterol.,,INFO
He's never eaten any eggs.,,INFO
He's never had anything but skim milk,,INFO
"and you know, I've never bought butter",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
and things like that.,,INFO
"But, um, oh, he just left for the doctor again",,INFO
"and it's, it's kind of back up.",,INFO
"Um, so he needs to be careful again.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So we've really been talking about the foods, you know, for him to, to be sure to eat",,INFO
The lower cholesterol foods and stuff,,INFO
"and, uh, so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days",,INFO
.,,CAT
And all that kind of stuff does really help.,,INFO
"Well, I think we've probably talked long enough",,INFO
and,,CAT
,,
"Okay Charles, uh, gun control,",,INFO
"what are you, uh, for, in favor or no comment?",,QUESTION
I'm very much in favor of gun control.,,INFO
"Oh, you are?",,QUESTION
Yes,,CAT
I am.,,CAT
"Well, this should be very interesting,",,INFO
.,,CAT
because I'm against it.,,INFO
"I don't, I don't mind people owning guns,",,INFO
"I just think it should be a little, you know, a little, a little more regulated.",,INFO
"Well, you know, uh, now he-, here's something that, uh, first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic, uh, weapons.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"Uh, now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons.",,INFO
"I believe that's correct,",,INFO
uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, yet, their, uh, the gun control enthusiasts are, are, uh, preaching about the gun control and how they should be, we should have stronger laws and what not.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have.,,INFO
"That would certainly help,",,INFO
I'm sure.,,INFO
"Now this is not just a state law,",,INFO
"this is a federal law,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
controlled by the Treasury Department.,,INFO
Yep.,,CAT
"Uh, for fully automatic weapons.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, all right, now for instance,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"in California where they passed the uh, uh, semiautomatic",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"or, or, uh, now what was it they called them?",,CAT
"The military version, attack weapons,",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"right,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
or something?,,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
that are automatic or semiautomatic?,,INFO
Yep.,,CAT
"I really don't have any problem, Jack, with, you know, uh, people using firearms for sporting purposes.",,INFO
"I don't have any problem,",,INFO
"the only thing I,",,INFO
I am in favor of the seven-day waiting period.,,INFO
"I would like to see that, see that happen.",,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"well, now, uh, I've got to admit I'm inclined to agree with you there",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, even though I am a member of the N R A,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they are again-, they, their reason being that well, if you let one little law get through, pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
and so forth and so on.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I understand that.,,INFO
And you've got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way.,,COMMAND
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"I, I, like I say, I don't have any problem with people using firearms, you know, for sporting purposes or hunting purposes,",,INFO
"I just think it's just may be a little too easy you know, to acquire one.",,INFO
"Uh,",,CAT
"On, on a whim of some sort.",,INFO
"That, that's true.",,CAT
"Uh, now did you hear about the, the control that they have up in Virginia?",,QUESTION
I'm not sure I have.,,CAT
"Uh, it, it's, it's a little hard to believe,",,INFO
"but they can, uh, of course,",,INFO
like just like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law.,,INFO
"Anyone ever convicted of a, a felony is, cannot purchase a weapon.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they don't have a waiting period, because they have access to computer records concerning all these felons.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And the-,",,CAT
"uh, when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in, uh, uh, Virginia, the salesman just calls some number and, uh, punches in your name,",,INFO
"and if it comes up negative, okay, fine,",,INFO
"and you get your gwu-, your gun right then and there.",,INFO
I see.,,CAT
"Uh, but they are the only state that does it.",,INFO
"Hm, that's interesting.",,G_G
"And, uh, according to Virginia, it didn't cost all that much.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and frankly, I, I don't understand why a state doesn't have those records available anyway.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"Uh, uh, at least",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
you would think they would.,,INFO
"uh, records of, of, uh, known felons",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
which are available to local police departments.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
I'm surprised that more states doesn't do that.,,INFO
"Uh, uh, uh, certainly those, those records are available,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and all they would have to do is expand it.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"To, uh, uh, well, connect them into a modem somehow.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I wouldn't think it'd be that difficult to do.,,INFO
"Well, Virginia is not a particularly rich state,",,INFO
"and they managed to fi-, squeak out a few bucks to do it.",,INFO
"Yep,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"And, uh, it's, uh, uh, one-hundred percent successful.",,INFO
"Hm, that's interesting.",,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
I just heard about this last week.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, they were bragging about it,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"with,",,CAT
"uh, uh, they should have, have pride in this because it's, it's a good system,",,INFO
Absolutely.,,CAT
and it's working well.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I agree.,,CAT
And they don't need that seven-day waiting period.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Because the whole idea of that waiting period was,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"so that, uh, it, uh, the police could check up on you.",,INFO
Yep.,,CAT
"Well, you know what's going to happen there,",,INFO
"those files are going to back up on somebody's desk, just some of that typical bureaucratic work.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that's another, uh, uh, thorn in my side,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"bureaucratics,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
I agree.,,CAT
politicians.,,INFO
"Yep,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"I was,",,INFO
So anyway,,INFO
"just thinking there's,",,INFO
"well, we seem to be one in favor and one against.",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"I guess that's about right,",,INFO
"Although neither one of us are, are, uh, really uh, uh, dyed in the wool.",,INFO
"Uh,",,CAT
"Uh, we,",,CAT
"but we both,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I'm not totally rigid on the subject,",,INFO
"I just think there should be, you know, shouldn't be quite so easy to do.",,INFO
"well, there should be some way of checking,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"now here in, in Texas, uh, all you need is a driver's license.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, even felons can still get a driver's license.",,INFO
"Sure, uh,",,CAT
"So I, I don't think they are too,",,INFO
"well, they're not rigid enough here, in Texas.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
But don't tell the N R A I said that.,,COMMAND
"I wo-,",,CAT
I promise.,,CAT
I won't,,CAT
They're liable to tear up my membership.,,INFO

I can understand that.,,G_G
"I have four sons scattered all over the country,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and a f-, few grandchildren.",,INFO
Yep.,,CAT
And I'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them.,,INFO
That'd be neat.,,G_G
Sure would.,,CAT

so I remembered something I learned I think when I was five years old,,INFO

but that's all I've done.,,INFO
"Oh, really.",,CAT
Uh.,,CAT

but I haven't done it in so long that I probably wouldn't remember how,,INFO
Do you make sweaters and things or just blankets?,,QUESTION
"Well, if I remember I think we made some, like Christmas stockings,",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
and sew them together and make Christmas stockings and maybe some slippers or something like that.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
I see.,,G_G
Nothing as big as a blanket.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
I know that my husband's grandmother does a lot of that.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff,,INFO
"but,",,CAT

I think I'm ready,,CAT
Okay,,CAT
okay.,,CAT
"Uh, you want to start off?",,COMMAND

"since I am in the forty age, I'm a fifties baby",,INFO

"uh,",,INFO

"Very much, yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Very much,",,G_G
and I think you'll have to agree,,INFO
and,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"and since we were in, uh, sort of the ground level, the bra burning of the sixties,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh,",,INFO
"and I think, you know, it got off to a really radical,",,INFO
"it has a radical fringe to it that, uh, I've sort of backed away from.",,INFO
I think all things get started sometimes in that manner.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, they come in that way.",,INFO
"And, to make a change, you know, you have to make a splash.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, to continue in that vein, I think it got a little bit warped and off the track",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"in several areas,",,INFO
but I really do think that women have made a contribution,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, to human beings, I mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions",,INFO
and it's okay,,INFO
"and I think, uh, you know on the other hand, I don't know that men have changed that much.",,INFO
"So in, in contrast to the women's changes, uh, you know, the men stay steady,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and then the women change around them.,,INFO
"I hadn't thought much about that,",,INFO
but that is true.,,G_G
"That,",,CAT
"Uh, I think men are trying.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Some of them.,,INFO
"But they don't have a national organization of men,",,INFO
No.,,CAT
"to, uh, help them out",,INFO
and,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"uh, what's changing them, though, is the economic situation,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
where both,,INFO
Very much.,,G_G
"team, it has to be a team partnership now,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and they both have to work,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they both have to raise the children,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"if we're going to have any kind of future at all,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, and that, I think has been the downfall of the last ten years.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, the me, oh,",,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"the, the yuppiedom,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"the whatever it was, the, you know, women didn't know how to go about doing the careers",,INFO
"and they wanted to compete with men,",,INFO
"they wanted to be like men,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and that's wrong.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men, men",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Not,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
"they, they hurt themselves a little bit in that way.",,INFO
"Absolutely,",,CAT
"and so that's, you know,",,CAT
"they sort of threw the thing back another, you know, ten years,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that they've had to, you know, restructure,",,INFO
"but I saw the greatest T-shirt the other day,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"I got to get some for all my men friends,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"it says, let men run the world, women have more important things to do",,INFO
There you go,,G_G
There's a lot of truth in that.,,G_G
Right.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, I think men and women both have valuable, valuable assets to offer",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, you know, we shouldn't,",,CAT
"we were made differently,",,INFO
That's right.,,G_G
"however you come to that conclusion,",,INFO
"we were biologically, physiologically, made differently",,INFO
"and there is great wonderment,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"in that,",,INFO
"and, uh, you know, we should respect that in each other",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT
it shouldn't be destroyed.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"And, and, you know, just sort of all s-, swooshed into one channel",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"sort of thing,",,INFO
"it's, it's viva la difference",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
someone said that,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and I think that you can truly respect the other person,",,INFO

Yeah.,,CAT
You know.,,INFO
Well that depends on what day of the month it is.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
"But, uh, I don't know,",,CAT
"I guess we've gotten more of a,",,INFO
"in, in terms of that, I think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and our roles,",,INFO
"and, but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"I think now when both are working they have a more ch-, more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, that's, that's a very different way to do,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, the woman doesn't start off at home,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"raising the kids and goes back into her career, you know,",,INFO

I don't know what I would do without my friends having all their kids.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I just love the babies,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT

Have you been that way long?,,QUESTION
"Just eight years,",,CAT
just,,CAT
Just eight years.,,CAT
the most important years of my life you know,,INFO

it has been.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, so there have been major, major adjustments,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but that's another story.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, you know, my husband has really, really filled in the gaps,",,INFO
"I mean I,",,INFO
That makes a big difference.,,INFO
I couldn't ask for a better life.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean if this is the way it had to be,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"this is the best way,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I could possibly do it,,INFO
"and, and that has a lot to do with his strength and his, just pitching in and, and his being able to, you know, all, all ego aside, do a lot of things",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"that really,",,INFO
"so, when I say men haven't changed I guess I should look at my own backyard sort,",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
of thing,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Well, probably your role",,INFO
"and, and the way you are also has changed, though.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,G_G
"You know, compared to what it would have been twenty, fifty years ago.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,G_G
"I mean, boy,",,G_G
"I mean I, I would have had so,",,INFO
I had so much guilt to begin with,,INFO
"and the changes that had to take place, you know,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
where I couldn't do a lot of things,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, just adjusting to that,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"that, uh, yeah, that was a major change,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but so, I guess uh, in the end, you know, you each take your own situation and you, and you deal with it the best you can,",,INFO
but,,INFO
"The best you can, yeah.",,CAT
"but, but women I think are a whole, you know sort of riding the course,",,INFO
"they're, they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there,",,INFO
I think the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation.,,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"that's the only thing I worry about is the, the child's love and security.",,INFO
"That,",,CAT
"I think that's being damaged, uh,",,INFO
"I think,",,INFO
a lot.,,INFO
"we're going to see a generation of kids that, you know, are just going to be a little bit, uh, oh, not very nurturing.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I think,",,CAT
"I do, too.",,CAT
"I, I think, uh,",,CAT
"now some, some women can, can do both.",,INFO
They're very capable of working,,INFO
"and, and,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"but I wish they weren't so many,",,INFO
"I, I wish they weren't role models for everybody,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
because it's so dangerous.,,INFO
"It, it really is, yeah.",,CAT
"It's dangerous for the woman, too, to think that she can do that",,INFO
"and then when she can't, you know, the failure of that is,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, her life sort of falls apart",,INFO
and she doesn't know who she is,,INFO
"and she's,",,CAT
"So many have to work to make a go of it, it seems,",,INFO
Absolutely.,,CAT
"or they say they do anyways,",,INFO
"and, but I think ones that don't have to, the,",,INFO
it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there.,,INFO
"Well, you know, I think that's, that's really, I think it depends on what part of the country you're in.",,INFO
"Well, that could be.",,G_G
"Uh, I, I would almost just say that because, you know, down here in the south",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, a woman's role is,",,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"a woman's role,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"sort of thing,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and you know,",,CAT
You mean it's stronger there?,,QUESTION
"Uh, oh, yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
Much stronger.,,G_G
"And, and I think that, uh, you know, career women still have a lot of problems here,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"with the good old boys,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"here in Texas sort of thing,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
making career moves,,INFO
"but,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, you know, in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents, uh, it's just like the way it, it has been for years.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean, you know, since the days of the pioneers, around here.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"That's the woman's role,",,INFO
Yes.,,G_G
"and it, and it's hard for her to, uh, you know, watch her peers be appreciated, I think sometimes,",,INFO
"but then I'm not there,",,CAT
so I don't know that.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
And I have women that do both,,INFO
"and I see a little jealousy on the part of, you know, the woman what has two little boys",,INFO
"and, and she has an au pair, which is a live-in college kid working for her",,INFO
and then she has her business in the back,,INFO
Uh.,,CAT

"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
all the time.,,INFO
And so I see I little bit of that,,INFO
"and I always wish there was a balance, you know,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"with the one and, and wish she could spend more time with her kids",,INFO
"and the other gal I wish she could just get out of Dodge,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
for a while,,INFO
"But they're both,",,INFO
Get some peace and quiet.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"they're both different people, too.",,INFO
"That's,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"definitely,",,G_G
so. You're right about that.,,CAT
That's where the trouble lies.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Some people, some people can adjust and have both, do both well,",,INFO
"And that's,",,CAT
and others can't.,,INFO
That's true.,,G_G

Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that.,,INFO
Word processing.,,INFO
"Well, more, uh,",,CAT
do you know Latek?,,QUESTION
No I'm,,CAT
"Wo-,",,INFO
not familiar with that.,,INFO

but I don't usually use a word processor to do it,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
and we don't have too much standard software.,,INFO
"Like I haven't bought, we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all.",,INFO
So we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that.,,INFO
"We use it more for just writing programs when we need to or, um, doing research, looking at the speech signal and then doing writing, and also as a just as a terminal,",,INFO
and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that.,,INFO
"So, you've got, you've got a modem in it then.",,INFO
"Uh, neither one has a modem,",,CAT
but we have a modem.,,INFO
At home,,QUESTION

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but, uh, went out of town for a while,",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without, uh, even without using it on the computer,",,INFO
"I could turn a computer on,",,INFO
it'd start squawking.,,INFO
So I finally opened up the box and took it out.,,INFO
So that was it.,,INFO
I think that's the thirty second warning.,,INFO
"Oh, I didn't hear it.",,INFO
"Do you hear, the, the beep in the background.",,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT

In Manhattan.,,INFO
Are you at home now?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
I'm at home.,,INFO
So you've got a lot of traffic noise real close.,,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal I mean, because there's a lot of background noise that, you know, people can hear.",,INFO
So it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up.,,INFO
"Um, yeah,",,CAT
"and often times that,",,CAT
"I can't talk on th-, can't do this much later than now, between sort of like six, five thirty and six thirty or something like that, because the traffic outside, they honk the horn so loud I can't even hear the phone call.",,INFO

"She told me some of the things you can do,",,INFO
"and it's just a, a very handy tool to have.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and you can do a l-,",,INFO
it makes things very convenient.,,INFO
"You can save a lot of money, too. Certainly cut down on long distance charges if you, if that's what you have in mind.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"I've never tried using that,",,INFO
I don't know too much about it.,,INFO

"uh, I,",,CAT
not heavy use.,,INFO

I've been through three classes,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I have a great deal of respect for it.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, I haven't done much word processing work with my job.",,INFO
I do some,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I,",,CAT
and the D Base work I've done was strictly class related.,,INFO
"I've never used D Base, um,",,INFO
but I've heard both good things and bad things about it.,,INFO
"Well, it's probably the granddaddy of most, uh, data base management systems.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
It's got some pretty strong competitors.,,INFO
"Some of them have reviews that are better than D Base,",,INFO
"so, I, I think by now, it's a matter of, uh, personal taste.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use.,,INFO
I can understand that very easily.,,INFO
"I've used, I've had a class on, um, R Base and also in Paradox",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Do you think you D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more.,,QUESTION
Or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days?,,QUESTION
"Um, I wouldn't say compatible, but",,INFO
"But, uh",,CAT
certainly comparable.,,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT

"I me-, there was no reason for him to really come into, you know, great stardom or anything.",,INFO
"I remember, I saw him in a concert, when I was,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think, I think it,",,CAT
I think it was in high school.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
He was very good.,,INFO
"I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in, uh, Philadelphia.",,INFO
"It was in J F K Stadium, if I can remember.",,INFO

Hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I've, I graduated back in seventy-nine,",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"Um, um. Uh-huh.",,CAT
"but, but I've really,",,CAT
"I, I loved,",,INFO
"I mean, I was, I was really into the album oriented music, even then,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"so I was really familiar with a lot, with a lot of, of the A O R type music.",,INFO
"Um, the album oriented like the, uh, James Taylor,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"and, the, uh, the Beatles,",,INFO
"and you know, I mean, a lot of people they go, they're better than the Beatles,",,INFO
"and I'm like, you know,",,INFO
.,,CAT
you don't know what you're talking about.,,INFO
No,,CAT
"I mean, the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles It was just,",,INFO
You can only laugh,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you just sort of,",,CAT
"you know, well I guess I can just humor them, you know At this point.",,INFO
Right,,CAT
"well, they,",,CAT
"I guess our age is showing when, we, we think that.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"but well, you know, I, I, I've liked a lot of the new music.",,INFO
"I think, um,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"um, when",,INFO
"I saw some promise, you know, with, with a lot of the new wave, when it, when it came out, uh,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
back in the mid and early eighties.,,INFO
"And then, um, I don't know",,CAT
"music is kind of in a weird, it's in a very weird position right now.",,INFO
"I think that,",,CAT
"I mean, I like, you know, things like to hear, you know, what they call world music. Which is, you know, using all these natural forms of music",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
Like Paul Simon.,,QUESTION
"Like,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
Paul Simon.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, you know, really that's not world music.",,INFO
"But, what, what Paul Simon's doing, I think is, is, is great because he's, you know I think, I think that using, I guess what they call it is eclectic, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"drawing from a lot of different sources and making, you know, a synthesis of a new type of music. Um,",,INFO
What do you mean by world music?,,QUESTION
"Well, world music is, um,",,INFO
"a lot of the, a lot of where they, where they make music that they adapt to a, to another kind of, to another type of listener.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, for example, let's say you're taking like an original Brazilian form of music and, with a certain style,",,INFO
"and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for, let's say another audience, let's say a North American.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, then when they hear it, it, it's a really, it's another form of music, and,",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"you know, sort of, um, trying to draw out the best sources.",,INFO
"The, the best of every type of music.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Because, I mean, there are some, I mean,",,CAT
"I, I li-,",,CAT
"there are some, you know, types of heavy metal that I really like,",,INFO
"but, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that I, I completely like heavy metal.",,INFO
No.,,CAT
"I, I think,",,CAT
"you know, and it's the same way with,",,INFO
"you know, world music takes the forms that have really been, um,",,INFO
"I guess, I",,CAT
"you know, the best example or, you know, the cream of the crop, I guess you could say,",,INFO
"and then, and then taking those, those qualities, and then applying, in the styles, that are really, um, that are extremely enjoyable, and then taking,",,INFO
"So then it becomes a kind of music of, of its own, so to speak,",,QUESTION
"or, uh,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
it becomes a kind of music of its own.,,INFO
"I mean, when you listen to it, it's um, uh,",,INFO
"I think that they don't use, elec-,",,INFO
"some of it,",,INFO
"it's,",,CAT
"they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"so, you know, well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now, and from West Africa, that's considered world music, because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"But, they're, they're trying to make it somewhat more modern.",,INFO
"I, I, I,",,CAT
"a good, another good example was I heard Miles Davis,",,INFO
"and Miles Davis worked with Robbie Shoncar,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"if you can believe it, I mean,",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"You know, he's a jazz performer,",,INFO
"and then he's playing with Robbie Shoncar,",,INFO
"who's a very good, he's a very good arranger.",,INFO
"Uh, arrangement to, uh,",,INFO
we're going to have to get off.,,COMMAND
"The,",,CAT
"are they trying to ,",,QUESTION
I don't know.,,CAT
"But, uh,",,CAT
We've talked our five minutes though.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"okay,",,CAT
"but, I mean, when I heard his album, I heard it and it was just incredible.",,INFO
I've been listening to that a lot lately.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I listened",,INFO
"and, I heard,",,INFO
"you know, you hear this guitar,",,INFO
and then you hear the muted trumpet.,,INFO
I,,CAT
"me,",,CAT
"and you never would think that they, that they can actually play together",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
Oh yeah.,,CAT
,,
"A, uh, Golden Retriever.",,INFO
"Ooh, that's",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
one of my favorite kinds of dogs.,,INFO
Is it really?,,QUESTION
How long have you had it?,,QUESTION
"We've had him for,",,INFO
"let's see, he just had his fourth birthday.",,INFO
Fourth birthday.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
and we got him when he was about eight weeks old,,INFO
"and, uh, he's pretty okay,",,INFO
we like him.,,INFO
Does he shed a lot?,,QUESTION
He does.,,CAT
That's the one thing we don't like about him.,,INFO
"In fact, we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off.",,INFO
.,,CAT
He'd probably look pretty funny if we did that.,,INFO
How much does he weigh now?,,QUESTION
"He, actually, he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything,",,INFO
and they put him on the scale,,INFO
and he's up to ninety four now.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"But he's not a real, he's not a real tall, uh, dog for a Golden Retriever.",,INFO
"He's kind of stocky, shorter and stockier.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"But,",,CAT
Is he good with family?,,QUESTION
He is.,,CAT
"It's, uh, just me and my wife",,INFO
"and, uh, he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids.",,INFO
.,,CAT
We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I can,,INFO
"Because I,",,CAT
understand that,,INFO
.,,CAT
Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
How about you?,,QUESTION
"Well, we have a cat who's also about four years old.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And he's our spoiled child right now, too",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And he also sheds a lot.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, we, uh, we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday.",,INFO
"But we figure we'll get the kids and then the, the dog",,INFO
That's probably a good idea.,,INFO
They're good though.,,INFO
"Uh, have you ever had a Retriever before?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
but my husband had one when he was growing up.,,INFO
"Because I, I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs.",,INFO
They don't tend to get real jealous or territorial.,,INFO
They like to play.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
Especially with the kids.,,INFO
They love to play with kids.,,INFO
"Is, is your dog an inside and outdoors?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
he's pretty much an inside dog.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
He stays in.,,INFO
"We, we're kind of in a, not a real busy neighborhood, but more so than I'd want him to be out too much",,INFO
and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside.,,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
He's really a wimp.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"And when it comes to being alone,",,INFO
"uh, now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants, he likes that,",,INFO
but he does not like to be tied outside.,,INFO
"He'll, he'll just bark and bark and bark.",,INFO
"Um, when he gets outside, does, in, does he run away and then eventually come back?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"he's, uh, taken to the training pretty well",,INFO
"and, uh, he knows where our yard is",,INFO
"and we have a pretty small yard,",,INFO
but he seems to know the boundaries.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"And he usually is good about staying within them,",,INFO
"although our next door neighbors have a dog, too",,INFO
"and, uh, she, she is good friends with my dog.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah?",,QUESTION
And so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff,,INFO
"but,",,INFO
.,,CAT
he's pretty good.,,INFO
He stays out of the street,,INFO
"and, uh, if I catch him I call him",,INFO
and he comes back.,,INFO
"So he, he's pretty good about taking to commands and",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
and things.,,INFO
Did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or,,QUESTION
No,,CAT
just,,INFO
we never did.,,INFO
train him on your own,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"I, I trained him on my own",,INFO
"and, uh, this is the first dog I've had all my own as an adult.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"We've had kid, or we've had dogs when I was a kid,",,INFO
"but this, this is the first one that I, uh, took in,",,INFO
"so I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get it all right the first time,",,INFO
"but, uh, he, he seems to have picked it up pretty well.",,INFO
I,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
never really to hit him or anything.,,INFO
"Just, you know",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
firm tone of voice and those,,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
sorts of things.,,INFO
"I, I see other people out there",,INFO
"and they hit their dogs and try to,",,INFO
"and, and those horrible collars that they put on them with invinc-, invisible fencing,",,INFO
"least I,",,CAT
Invisible what?,,CAT
"Invisible fencing,",,INFO
have you heard of that?,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
what is that?,,QUESTION
"It's, uh, it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little, uh, transducers or emitters in your yard",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
at the perimeter,,INFO
and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it,,INFO
"and if they get too close to that perimeter, it",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
it zaps them.,,INFO
Boy.,,G_G
Yeah,,CAT
I'd be afraid to walk around if I was that dog,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog",,INFO
and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to,,INFO
so he held on to the collar,,INFO
and he walked out to the perimeter.,,INFO
He said it was a good jolt.,,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and so, I, I don't take too well to, to those",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
sorts of training techniques.,,INFO
I don't think they're always necessary.,,INFO
"If you put enough patience into,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
just be consistent and diligent,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
with it,,INFO
"and, um,",,CAT
"It's, uh, is your cat an indoor cat or an",,QUESTION
Yeah,,CAT
outdoor cat?,,INFO
"he's indoor and all declawed because I know the, uh, average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months.",,INFO
Somebody just told me that,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
because of the leukemia?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that and also just, uh, getting hit, I guess, or getting beat up.",,INFO
And the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"So,",,CAT
Quite a difference.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"What, uh, what kind of climate do you have?",,QUESTION
"Well, uh, it's, we just moved recently",,INFO
"so now we're in the, uh, Dallas area",,INFO
and it's very,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
very nice,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"Um, I guess what, I guess my task.",,INFO
I usually ride my bike.,,INFO
"I have, uh, a stationary bike and, uh, a regular bike.",,INFO
"And when I can, I like to ride my regular bike outside, because it's so much nicer.",,INFO
"The stationary bike is, is so, uh,",,INFO
Boring.,,INFO
boring.,,INFO
"But I have head phones,",,INFO
"and I, plus I have it, uh, in the living room",,INFO
"so I either watch T V,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"or we have a fish tank,",,INFO
"so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied.",,INFO
"If, I like to have the T V on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied.",,INFO
It kind of takes the time away,,INFO
"and I don't realize, really, that's really the only time I ever watch T V, is when I'm on the bike.",,INFO
"But, and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know,",,INFO
"and that just kind of gets myself, uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess.",,INFO
But it's definitely a task.,,INFO
You think so?,,QUESTION
I can't say that I really enjoy it.,,INFO
"I wish that I did enjoy it more,",,INFO
but I do it because I have to not because I want to,,INFO
"I bought a stationary bike,",,INFO
"but I find that if I sit on that seat too long, it hurts.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"And I haven't figured how to get that soft,",,INFO
and I tried even tying a pillow to it.,,INFO
"But two years ago, I joined, well, it's not quite two years, it's almost two years, I joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I love it.,,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
I just love it.,,INFO
So is it just women that go there?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
It's totally women.,,INFO
"See, I think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place, uh, a, a health club.",,INFO
Because I don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise.,,INFO
"You know, so I have tried to just do stuff at home",,INFO
"and, uh, I just feel conscious about it.",,INFO
"I mean, I'm not big, you know, or anything,",,INFO
but I still don't like other people watching me.,,INFO
"I like to be able to sweat, have my hair a mess.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"feel that, okay fine, if my bathing suit slips a little bit I don't have to be conscious",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
of it being a little bit too low.,,INFO
"And I, my bathing suit's just one piece,",,INFO
"so there's no big deal all the way around,",,INFO
but,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I don't have to be conscious of what I'm doing or how I'm doing it.,,INFO
"And it's, uh, oh, it's just, I don't know, it's, it's a total free relaxation.",,INFO
"Because, hey, you can do what you want.",,INFO
"You're a female,",,INFO
and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing.,,INFO
"That's what,",,CAT
And they've got such fantastic equipment in there.,,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
"That's,",,G_G
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
that's great.,,INFO
"How,",,CAT
And I love the water aerobics.,,INFO
I love the water aerobics.,,INFO
Do they have a pool,,QUESTION
"or what is,",,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
They've got a nice one.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
They have two types of water aerobics.,,INFO
"They call it aqua exercise, I guess is what they call it.",,INFO
I've heard that that's really good for you to do.,,INFO
It pushes you because you're pushing against the water,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
in itself.,,INFO
So it is like double strenuous.,,INFO
But you're not being double strenuous on your own body.,,INFO
Because you're pushing it yourself.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
So you're doing it yourself.,,INFO
"So you don't really feel like you're really working that hard, do you?",,QUESTION
Huh-uh.,,CAT
When you're in the water?,,QUESTION
Huh-uh.,,CAT
"The only thing that I ever felt was, every time I stop and start going again, because I end up getting two jobs once in a while.",,INFO
I end up having to quit for a while.,,INFO
"But I get blisters on my toes on the bottom because,",,INFO
"Oh, wow.",,G_G
I really jump a lot.,,INFO
"Well, that's funny,",,G_G
I never would have thought of that.,,INFO
"Well, a lot of people wear those little, uh, terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom. Especially around the pool.",,INFO
So they just,,INFO
"Like wat-,",,QUESTION
wear them right into the pool.,,INFO
Are they water shoes?,,INFO
"Is that,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
They're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with,,INFO
"Oh, okay,",,CAT
okay.,,CAT
"rubber, you know, soles,",,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
okay.,,CAT
"so that, you know,",,INFO
no big deal one way or the other.,,INFO
"Huh, that's really funny",,G_G
"But, I never think about it until after you go there for about a week, your toes, you start getting blisters anyway.",,INFO
So no big deal.,,INFO
"Huh, that's,",,CAT
But it's fun.,,INFO
"So, how often do find yourself going?",,QUESTION
"Um, on a, if you're doing it on a regular basis, how often do you go?",,QUESTION
I try to make it at least three times a week.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"That's really,",,CAT
"For a while I was doing it every day. Just,",,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
"going, uh, five days a week.",,INFO
I wish that I could make myself exercise every day.,,INFO
"But I do force myself to do it at least three times a week. Which I don't feel like is enough,",,INFO
"but i-, it's, it's at least something.",,INFO
"You know, it, it,",,CAT
"I just force, I have to force myself to do it, like I said, because to me, I really don't enjoy it.",,INFO
But I know that I have to do it.,,INFO
"I mean it's just, it's, it's not a question of whether I want to, you know.",,INFO
"Well,",,CAT
"But,",,CAT
"When I was working up at, uh, The Summit,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"here in Plano, I'd leave there,",,INFO
and I'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock.,,INFO
"Oh, that's,",,CAT
"Oh, actually about four thirty because they start at five to six,",,INFO
"so I was there by four thirty, every night.",,INFO
And the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Because no matter what I did or how I did it, I invariably got myself wet.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But the water only comes up basically to your, anywhere from your waist to your, oh, chest, I'd say.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So I mean, it's your choice where you want to go,",,INFO
"but,",,INFO
"Did you ever,",,CAT
I enjoyed it higher.,,INFO
"Well, I'm sorry",,G_G
That's okay.,,CAT
"Uh, did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for T I?",,QUESTION
Did you,,QUESTION
"I have a,",,CAT
ever try that?,,INFO
"I have a bad back,",,INFO
so I'm very limited what I do.,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"It's like I can walk,",,INFO
but if I walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"Especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard,",,INFO
it will bother me.,,INFO
"Then that would,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
it will bother me.,,CAT
"I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you, wouldn't it?",,QUESTION
"Well, that, what pushed me that way though, was basically was the fact that when I went in there, is wasn't for the water aerobics.",,CAT
I went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And, uh, she said, Hey, go for the swimming pool.",,INFO
She says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor.,,INFO
She says in fact you get more.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"I said, okay, because I'm not a swimmer.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I like water.,,INFO
I'm not scared of it.,,INFO
"But I couldn't,",,INFO
"I guess I could swim across the pool,",,INFO
but I'm no swimmer per se.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
But I found that this worked really well.,,INFO
And I came out of there,,INFO
and I saw my stomach going down well.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"I dropped, oh, I'd say almost twenty pounds.",,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
Just by watching what I ate.,,INFO
"And they fix you up with a diet, which worked real good.",,INFO
What if you're already on one?,,QUESTION
"I mean,",,CAT
What?,,QUESTION
A diet?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean, when you go in there, they wouldn't make you do theirs. Would they?",,QUESTION
"Oh, no,",,CAT
they have nothing to do with that.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"See I joined, uh, when this one down here opened up, I joined as a V I P.",,INFO
"And the V I P gives you, uh, oh, gives you a diet, a computerized diet.",,INFO
"And they go over all your health and all your history,",,INFO
"and they show you how, everything to do, and how to do it, and the whole nine yards.",,INFO
"So it became part of the package,",,INFO
so I went through it.,,INFO
It worked out well.,,INFO
But they have packages where they just offer the exercise program.,,QUESTION
Is that what you're saying?,,QUESTION
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
You can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too.,,INFO
"I see,",,CAT
okay.,,CAT
"I just went and took the, because they were offering it as an opening benefit,",,INFO
"so it was, it's less than what you pay now for going in there,",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
after all this time.,,INFO
"So it's like when I got laid off,",,INFO
"I went back in there, and start all over again because it had been a while since I'd done it.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
So I get all the same treatment again.,,INFO
So it's kind of nice.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"That's,",,CAT
"Like I said, I like it.",,INFO
I like the heat.,,INFO
"I like the,",,CAT
"I jump out of the swimming pool,",,INFO
and I go into the hot tub.,,INFO
Oh,,CAT
And I love it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
That would be really nice,,INFO
"Because I have n-, I have never,",,CAT
"let me reword that,",,INFO
I think I have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore.,,INFO
But that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"That's,",,CAT
I knew I was pushing too far.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But usually, when I go into the hot tub before I go swimming, or when I come out, I'm totally relaxed when I go home.",,INFO
It's no big deal.,,INFO
"So you really do enjoy your exercise then, since your,",,INFO
It's fun.,,CAT
It's fun.,,CAT
"Uh, I've gotten on the bike.",,INFO
"And they've got, uh, the stepping bike, where you step.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I've enjoyed that, watching how well I can walk up and down stairs.",,INFO
"That's, you know,",,CAT
"I wanted,",,INFO
But most of the others to me are very dull.,,INFO
"I wanted to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike,",,INFO
but I got talked into the bike instead.,,INFO
"And I don't know,",,CAT
I really wanted a stepper.,,INFO
I'm considering maybe even buying one of those too.,,INFO
But I'm not sure if I'll get benefit out of both of them.,,INFO
"I mean, I don't know if it would really do any good having both of them.",,INFO
"Which one do you feel is better, since you use them both?",,QUESTION
"Um, I get bored very easily.",,INFO
"Uh, the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit.",,INFO
"Like you said, you can sit and do it, and watch the T V and not even really be conscious of what you are doing.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"With the stepper, you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down.",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"So you have a little, you know, little,",,CAT
"you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
to what your gear is.,,INFO
"Uh, I,",,CAT
it would depend upon which one you want.,,INFO
"I think now that I've had the bicycle,",,INFO
I would go to the stepper.,,INFO
"But if I were you, I would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while.",,INFO
Because you can buy a month's membership.,,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
And see what you feel is best for you.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"Because it all depends, you know, for everyone their own what they want to do.",,INFO
Because I jump on the bike here at home.,,INFO
"Mine has its, see, the handle bars go up and down,",,INFO
Uh-hum.,,CAT
"so I can sit there and read and listen to music, like what you said,",,CAT
and it has no effect on me.,,INFO
"So I mean, it's boring",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
,,
"Basically, uh, my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases.",,INFO
We really don't get into small little purchases.,,INFO
"If we're going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card,",,INFO
"but, other than that it's not something that we use a lot of.",,INFO
"Uh, we may have only two or three versus, uh, I know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or, uh, up to a dozen credit cards,",,INFO
"but, uh, ours are just major credit cards that we have and, uh, use, uh, use only when when we feel it's necessary to make a big purchase.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
is that like Visa and,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
and Mastercard.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Do you have department store credit cards too,",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Uh, yeah,",,CAT
one Sears.,,INFO

"Sears is pretty major with us simply because we do, uh,",,INFO
Appliances.,,INFO
Appliances and things like that,,INFO
and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate.",,INFO
"If you've got the cash to pay for something, it's better to do it that way than versus credit cards, unless it's a small enough sum that you can do it within a two, three month period,",,INFO
but,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"if it's, uh, any large purchases, uh, you've got to kind of think about, uh, how much you're going to put down as far as, uh, payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or",,INFO
Right,,CAT
"twenty percent interest taken off,",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
"My, my husband and I do basically the same thing,",,INFO
"but we, we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise us.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
We still pay it off every month,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
if it kills us,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But, we do it mainly for, you know, the cash flow,",,INFO
"what is that, oh, float.",,CAT
"That's the word, float.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Sure,",,CAT
sure.,,CAT
"And, I often will keep tra-, track of what I've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
already.,,INFO
"Sure,",,CAT
so you know.,,CAT
"And sometimes just,",,CAT
and keep a list and make sure I,,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
I don't go over a certain limit.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Especially around birthdays, you know.",,CAT
Exactly.,,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
Exactly,,CAT
"If we go out to a restaurant, oh, just to float it,",,INFO
"or, I don't know.",,CAT
"Or, if it's a business transaction",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"a lot of times that's important, too",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"my husband has a, a,",,INFO
to keep a better receipt of it.,,INFO
"So, yeah.",,CAT
"Or anytime like a plane ticket, or, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Even if we have the,",,INFO
"I'm sure we'd have the cash before we got it,",,INFO
but,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
the float,,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for that.,,INFO
"Oh, sure.",,CAT
For the month or whatever.,,INFO
That thirty days,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
or whatever.,,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
We have a new one from A T AND T,,INFO

"Uh-huh,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Be interesting,",,INFO
"that's nice, because you can use it for a calling card also.",,INFO
"Exactly,",,CAT
sure.,,CAT
"It's a Mastercard, too,",,INFO
so,,CAT
"Sure,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"It's kind of fun, uh,",,INFO
but you get a lot of junk mail about them.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah",,CAT
"and you always get these preapproved, uh, credit card things coming through, uh,",,INFO
"your credit is great,",,INFO
so let's send you another credit card,,INFO
or,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
you're such a,,INFO
"it's preapproved for,",,INFO
a wonderful person,,INFO
"That's, that's to entice you to get more credit cards.",,INFO
We'll give you five thousand dollars,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
up front,,INFO
"And so, you know, we always laugh about that because it's quite a bit",,INFO
"I mean, you know, you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
Right.,,CAT
"Do you have, uh, an annual fee on yours",,QUESTION
or do you get yours through a bank,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Uh, ours is through a bank, yeah. *",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
We had it a long time ago through a bank,,INFO
and it just a,,CAT
"but,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I can't see paying an annual fee for it.",,INFO
I mean I almost,,INFO
"Oh, you're already paying them, uh, if you're, if you don't pay it off within that month, interest, anyway,",,INFO
"so, yeah,",,CAT
that's exactly it,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Okay.,,G_G
"Well, it sounds like I'm being paged otherwise.",,G_G
Okay.,,G_G
So,,G_G
"All right,",,G_G
thanks a lot.,,G_G
Good talking to you.,,G_G
Bye now.,,G_G

"What do you do there in Lubbock as far as, uh, recycling is concerned?",,QUESTION
"Well, you know they actually started",,INFO
"and I assumed it was T I wide, uh,",,INFO
"they, they started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, I've you know",,CAT
either computer paper or different types of paper.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I've had some ideas on how I think they could probably do it a little less expensively and accomplish the same purpose,",,INFO
"but I, I guess I need to put it on paper and turn it in",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Wha-,",,QUESTION
Uh.,,CAT
what would be more efficient about it.,,INFO
"Wha-, what,",,CAT
"Well, the way they have, you know, they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module, or down the hall",,INFO
or,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"a lot of people aren't going to get up, walk out of their offices and go there.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, where I use to work we had what we called tree boxes.",,INFO
That's just what we called them.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And they were recycled cardboard.,,INFO
They were eight and a half by eleven,,INFO
and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there,,INFO
"and when it filled up you called, you know facilities whoever to come pick it up",,INFO
and they brought you another box.,,INFO
"So not only is it, you know,",,INFO
"I think more people would take advantage of it and use it, uh,",,INFO
"I think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to, to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
kind of type thing.,,INFO
I see.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I, I, uh, was going to say cause I know I have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for for paper on it",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
you know,,INFO
"and, uh, if",,INFO
If.,,CAT
"if I have a, if I, I printed up something that I don't need it, just chunk it in the, in the paper.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
but somebody still has to collect all that,,INFO
That's true.,,G_G
and bundle it together,,INFO
"and whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full, you close the box, it's already bundled, it's already done for you.",,INFO
Certainly that's a good idea.,,G_G
So you're saving a lot of time and effort.,,INFO
I just need to put it on paper and,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I guess recommended it to somebody and see if they thinks it's feasible,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, uh, what else do they do in the Dallas area?",,QUESTION
"Well, uh, as far as T I is concerned, I'm not sure.",,INFO
"Uh, and I have heard, you know, uh, in residential situations.",,INFO
I live in a dorm,,INFO
"and I have heard in residential situations, uh, like in Plano",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, that they are doing, uh, stuff like having recycle picked up",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"where, uh, the city, uh, I guess the sanitation department, uh, as part of their responsibility picks up, uh, the recycled items as well, you know, the plastics and the paper uh, and aluminum",,INFO
"and, uh, the only responsibility of the, of the, patron is to separate them",,INFO
"and then the, the,",,CAT
"uh, I guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them",,INFO
and it doesn't cost the patron anything.,,INFO
"Doesn't really cost the, uh, department.",,INFO
Anything extra.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"They don't pay, they don't pay for the recycled items.",,INFO
That sounds good.,,G_G
"There's,",,CAT
"I, I've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where, you know, from the kitchen where you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other",,INFO
"or the, the even, uh,",,CAT
"there are areas that can recycle the, the tin cans, like your",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, vegetable things come in",,INFO
"and, uh, so I, I've not done that,",,INFO
"but that's kind of what I want to set up so. Because we do go through aluminum cans, you know.",,INFO
That's probably the one we use most.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, but,",,CAT
"Well, wh-, what kind of services do you have there in Lubbock as far as,",,QUESTION
"uh, where can you take your recycle items? *",,QUESTION
"I, I lived in Abilene for a, uh,",,INFO
I went to school there at Abilene Christian,,INFO
"and I,",,CAT
"it was so hard to, uh,",,INFO
you know if you,,INFO
Find a place.,,INFO
you wanted to recycle you newspapers it was impossible.,,INFO
"Well, uh, uh they, they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers, aluminum cans, those are the two major items.",,INFO
"You know, we can take oil, like car oil, recycled oil to,",,INFO
"they have, uh, uh, dump areas like at the fire departments",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
throughout town.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I think they can do the plastics, like the liter bottles",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
things like that.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, but, I, I don't know.",,CAT
I know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"Well, that's good.",,INFO
I do that,,INFO
I think people are becoming more aware.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know of, of the waste",,INFO
"and you know I, I like to see, you know,",,CAT
you drive through Burger King now and the bags are recycled paper,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and you know, so, you know I feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it.",,INFO
"You know, maybe it's making an impact",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Do you tend to buy more recycled items that, if something, uh, the pack says recycled and something else doesn't?",,QUESTION
"Do,",,CAT
would you tend to chose the one that does,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
I'm not as good about searching something out like that,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but if I am there and the choice is there,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
I would probably take the recycled product.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, you know, that's just where I probably need to be a little more responsible, citizen wise, you know, looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way.",,INFO
"Sure,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"So, uh, you know, they are getting away from the styrofoam,",,INFO
,,
"Well, do you do any recycling?",,QUESTION
"Uh, we do here.",,CAT
"Uh, see, what do we recycle?",,CAT
"We, they recycle,",,CAT
they have bins,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and, uh, plastic bottles",,INFO
and I think that's all they have.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
What about you guys?,,QUESTION
"Well, we, uh,",,CAT
"there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here, although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is, uh, aluminum cans.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, uh, we've got a, we've got a couple of different things, uh, places, uh,",,INFO
they're like unattended aluminum can smashers,,INFO
"And you can go up there and, and, uh, redeem,",,INFO
"we've got one that gives you like a penny a can,",,INFO
"so if you,",,CAT
Really?,,QUESTION
Yeah,,CAT
For smashed cans?,,QUESTION
"Well, actually, you have to give, put them in there unsmashed.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, when you do that it, it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot.",,INFO
"Oh, can you, can you hold on for just a minute?",,COMMAND
Sure.,,CAT
I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"that I pressed it hard enough because, okay, just succeed",,INFO
Okay?,,QUESTION
"Oh, okay,",,CAT
"well, I guess, I guess,",,INFO
"Well, I heard it that, I heard it that time",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"Okay,",,CAT
"well, anyways, you guys only get a penny a can.",,INFO
"Well, when you buy like, uh, canned drinks and stuff like that, do they charge you for the deposit?",,QUESTION
"Uh, no,",,CAT
you probably get charged like a nickel,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
or something like that.,,INFO
Exactly,,CAT
"and so it's like they charge you for the deposit,",,INFO
"so when you turn in the cans unsmashed, you're just, like, reimbursed.",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
Type of thing.,,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
they don't charge us that extra nickel.,,INFO
"That's sort of nice, though",,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it, it really is.",,CAT
"Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the, off the price, if you want to think of it that way.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So when we get like, uh, uh, a twelve pack, then that's like twelve cents back.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
so you guys can actually get ahead,,QUESTION
Yeah,,CAT
"But, uh, they have sort of like, uh, things that you c-, you're not like reimbursed for or paid for.",,INFO
"Like we can recycle, uh, clear glass, brown glass, green glass.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, and milk jugs and, uh, newspapers, you know,",,INFO
everyone does newspapers.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
everybody does newspapers.,,G_G
"But, that, that kind of stuff.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But they, they said they can't be smashed or else, uh,",,INFO
it doesn't fit in their little containers,,INFO
"and they're not reimbursed by the, the people who are over them or something.",,INFO
"Well, shoot, maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed, uh, Pepsi cans and whatever",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
up there,,INFO
"Exactly,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"send it to this address,",,INFO
no,,CAT
.,,CAT
"But, uh, let's see,",,CAT
"they said that, how, ways, can encourage recycling, uh,",,INFO
"I, I, I tell you what, what really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, e-, even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it, you know what I mean, then people tend to do it. Uh,",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's,",,CAT
"In other words, taking care of the environment is, is all well and good",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, uh",,INFO
As likely to do it.,,INFO
likely to do it,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"as if, uh, if you get something back for it. You know.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"And, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass on to the consumer, you know, it kind of reminds me of using an A T M card, you know, to get money",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
or doing your banking.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, if it's free, people will use it,",,INFO
"if it costs them something, then they're not as likely to use it.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
exactly.,,CAT
You know.,,CAT
"But, uh, I know we had a problem down here with, uh, oil, people taking oil out of their cars",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and just putting it down the d-, you know, the s-, the drain sewer.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, all that, because there was,",,INFO
"apparently a lot of people, you know, every time they change the oil,",,INFO
"they just dump all the res-, their old oil down there.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Now they're starting to recycle that stuff.,,INFO
"Oh, that's good.",,G_G
"Uh, another thing I thought of, I guess, to recycle would be like clothes, because I mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other.",,INFO
"And one way that we do it sort of in, in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And that way, you know, you don't get near enough as, as much as you bought it for,",,INFO
"but you, you got the use out of it",,INFO
"and what you're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever, anyways, you can get a little bit of money for.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And so,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"that's something that I've never,",,INFO
"I, we're, we're new to Iowa",,INFO
"so that's something that I hadn't, you know, looked into before.",,INFO
"But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I know a lot of places, they, uh, uh,",,INFO
,,
"Okay, Mary.",,CAT
Yes.,,CAT
"Um, the, uh, the latest one I've seen, uh, had to do with a, uh, uh, the, uh, basically a manhunt, um,",,INFO
"and it was, uh, it was called MANHUNTER, actually.",,INFO
"Uh, the, uh, the guy, uh, apparently had a, a, mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people. Uh, just, uh, kill them with, with as much blood and, and guts as possible.",,INFO
"Oh, how awful",,G_G
"It was true, it was truly awful.",,INFO
"It was not one that I picked,",,INFO
"but, uh, uh, it, it did show some, some, uh, some interesting things about the F B I",,INFO
"because they were the, the, uh, the characters trying, trying to get him were F B I people",,INFO
"and, uh, uh, of the, of the few good things that were in it, it did show, uh, a lot about the F B I. About the training, and, and how they go through training and how they try to, to develop, uh, uh, a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that.",,INFO
"And it was, uh, uh, it was pretty telling about the, the, the F B I and their procedures.",,INFO
I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, uh, going, I guess.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, they keep it rather secretive,",,INFO
yes,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Well the most recent movie I saw, uh, I'm afraid was, uh,",,INFO
"well two, two of them actually.",,INFO
"Uh, the RAIN MAN was one.",,INFO
Oh that was great one.,,INFO
"Wasn't that fabulous,",,CAT
"and,",,INFO
"Oh, I loved it.",,INFO
and DRIVING MISS DAISY.,,INFO
"You know, I haven't seen that one yet,",,INFO
and I need to go see it.,,INFO
"Oh, you need to see that.",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black,,INFO
and this all took place in the South.,,INFO
Oh my.,,G_G
"And, uh, normally never the twain shall meet.",,INFO
"You bet, especially in the South.",,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT
"right,",,CAT
"and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie.",,INFO
The acting was phenomenal.,,INFO
"Well as, it, as I recall it got some Academy Awards, didn't it.",,QUESTION
"Oh yes,",,CAT
Jessica Tandy won best actress,,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
"Oh yeah,",,CAT
that's right.,,INFO
"It, it might have one best picture, too.",,INFO
Yes,,CAT
"it did,",,INFO
yes,,CAT
it did.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Just as RAIN MAN, uh, with Dustin Hoffman,",,INFO
"That was,",,CAT
"uh, that, that was tremendous and Tom Cruise.",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
"I, I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of, uh, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman,",,INFO
"but, uh.",,CAT
"Yes,",,CAT
"uh, oh, that was, that was, uh, what the, much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it must have been great just being with him on, on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his, for his lines and all that stuff.",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"Which is just forty-five miles from, from where I am, where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton.",,INFO
"Is, is the Kmart there?",,QUESTION
"Oh, we do have Kmart here,",,CAT
you better believe it.,,CAT
Isn't there a Kmart everywhere?,,QUESTION
"That was, that was so funny,",,INFO
"he had to,",,INFO
or was it Kmart.,,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
He had to buy his underwear at Kmart.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right,,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
That was hilarious.,,INFO
"The, the, I guess the, the first, the first, uh, scene in that movie that really got my attention, uh, concerning the, the disease and all that was when he, uh, dropped the, the, uh, the toothpicks,",,INFO
Oh yes.,,CAT
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
Unbelievable.,,INFO
"Well, you know there are people, uh, referred to as savants also,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, who can do most phenomenal things",,INFO
and everyone feels they are totally retarded.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"wel-, because that's the way they, they might seem outwardly,",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"but, boy there's a lots going on in there",,INFO
It's amazing,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah,,CAT
"and I, the, the, I think the, the best thing about RAINMAN was the, uh, the way that they put together the, the real awfulness of the, of the, of the disease,",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"only,",,INFO
"an, and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it, you know,",,INFO
"and, and, and you need to, to work with it, uh, you know, certainly on, on a daily basis but then ag-, then again work with it toward a good end.",,INFO
Yes,,CAT
"and the,",,CAT
"Not, not toward winning in Las Vegas, for example.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
well the warmth that developed between them,,INFO
"and again it, I think was a picture of relationships.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Again the relationship, uh, between the two, uh, that, uh, never would have occurred, uh, by accident.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"I was, uh, I was so impressed with that movie",,INFO
I saw it three times.,,INFO
Did you.,,QUESTION
"I can, I can se-, tell you, oh, so much about that movie, just because it, it really rang, uh, rang a lot of my, uh, my personal background.",,INFO
"I, I have a, a brother myself that's, that's older",,INFO
"and, uh, he's not, you know,",,INFO
"nothing, nothing, of course, serious is wrong with him",,INFO
"but, uh, but we have gone through these, these lapses of, of a relationship,",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"somewhat, sometimes,",,INFO
"and then, you know, uh, for, for, for no real, you know, direct reason, I guess, uh, we, we get into, uh, uh, a really good relationship for a while and then, you know, back and forth",,INFO
"so I, I was really able to, to relate to the, the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers.",,INFO
That was neat.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well that's tremendous,",,G_G
"that, it's good because it does make you think, about your own family.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT

"I'm like, oh, come on.",,INFO
Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, uh, uh, with the kinds of problems that he had.",,INFO
And to make it believable.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT

I don't know about any body else,,INFO

they're not going to take those courses.,,INFO

If it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices,,INFO

if you let them all walk around carrying guns,,INFO

if everyone walking around carrying a guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire.,,INFO

"it's more of a police action in itself,",,INFO

Yeah.,,CAT

"What,",,INFO
that was the topic.,,INFO
I consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Say a person, uh, uh, get,",,CAT
all of a sudden my combat in me goes up,,INFO
"and say I've got the vibes, this guy's fixing to do something,",,INFO
I go ahead and pull my piece.,,INFO

And I make sure this persons sees it so that he's got now doubt that I will use it on him,,INFO
and I will use it right then.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"If he doesn't back up at that point he deserves what he gets because I have sent the clearest signal you mess with me, you mess with my family, I'm going to dust you.",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well as, as someone who would, would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander, I feel more comfortable with people having blades because, uh, you're not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly",,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
"Well, if I'm the one doing the shooting I don't miss.",,INFO
That's the kind of training I've had.,,INFO
I mean ...,,CAT
,,
"I think that, uh, one, uh, advantage of having, uh, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't, uh, convict someone who, uh, really shouldn't be convicted.",,INFO
Definitely.,,CAT
"Um, and I think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, uh, helps to ensure that.",,INFO
"I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Have you ever served on a jury before?,,QUESTION
"Uh, I have twice.",,CAT
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
It was a pretty wild experience.,,INFO
"Uh, what sorts of cases were they?",,QUESTION
"They were just, you know, small time cases where, uh, trailers and banks were involved, you know.",,INFO
So were they criminal or civil?,,QUESTION
They were civil.,,INFO
They weren't,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
they weren't any criminal.,,INFO
"What, uh, what was the verdict?",,QUESTION
"Did the, did the jury have trouble reaching a decision?",,QUESTION
"Uh, the jury, it was, uh, let me see, I think it was ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"so it was,",,CAT
"they,",,CAT
"and, uh, the one changed his vote at the end.",,INFO
So did it become?,,QUESTION
"So it became unanimous, you know, after they turned it in",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and then he changed his mind after they turned it in,,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
but it then became unanimous.,,INFO
"Uh. But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, right?",,QUESTION
You just needed a majority?,,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
"What was, what was the other case?",,QUESTION
That was also civil?,,QUESTION
"The, the other case was just traffic,",,INFO
"the,",,CAT
"and, you know, it was seat belt law",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and it, it didn't even hardly",,INFO
"Oh, didn't really even count.",,INFO
"go through,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"I'm, I'm a college student",,INFO
"so I haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"um, and, uh, I did get one summons actually at one point,",,INFO
"but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad time.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, you learn a lot going to the juries like that though.",,INFO
"Yeah, I mean, I, I really, I would like to, uh, to do at some point, um,",,INFO
"but, I, I haven't.",,INFO
"Uh, one, one thing that I, I think is, um, you know, maybe is a problem is, uh, I, I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now,",,INFO
but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.,,INFO
Especially sort of.,,CAT
I wouldn't think that it does,,INFO
"How, wha-,",,CAT
"I mean, from, from my, from what I experienced in them,",,INFO
"it didn't, you know, it didn't turn out the way I planned it, I mean, the way that I would think that it would go.",,INFO
"Uh, you thought it turned out pretty well?",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"but it was, you know, it was,",,CAT
jury was unorganized,,INFO
"and it was, it was just wasn't organized enough for me.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I'm not used to it not being organized,",,INFO
and I just assumed that it would have been.,,INFO
"Oh, so it was just kind of a zoo",,INFO
"and the jurors just sort of,",,INFO
someone had to figure out what was going on?,,QUESTION
That's about what it was.,,CAT
Um. That's interesting.,,INFO
"Did it, did it work out pretty well in the end?",,QUESTION
"I mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, uh, sort of a moderator role in the trial",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"they, well they picked one person,",,INFO
"and then he finally, you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have.",,INFO
"So it work-, it did end up working out pretty well?",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
it ended up working all right.,,INFO
"The one thing I sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like pro-, product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"you know, it's not just a matter of, um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy,",,INFO
"and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract,",,INFO
"it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues,",,INFO
"and I wonder if, uh, if there's really, um, if the system works adequately in, in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion.",,INFO
"I, I don't think that they, they, they educate them enough to, to really know what's going on.",,INFO
"In, in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind.",,INFO
So.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"the, the bank was suing them for, uh, because they went to get the, the trailer",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"that, which was, uh, seemingly their property.",,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
It was on his property.,,INFO
"Oh, so the deal was that he had, uh, borrowed money from the bank to buy it,",,INFO
and,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
he hadn't made the payments.,,INFO
So they came to get it.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And then when they came to get it, well, it was on the landlord's property",,INFO
and he wouldn't let them take it off.,,INFO
"Uh, so they were suing to get it back.",,INFO
"So, and they are, it was a double wide,",,INFO
so they'd already taken it apart.,,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
So they left it there,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it.,,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"So they were suing him for the money,",,INFO
"and, you know, there's no way they could because it, it was the moving company,",,INFO
,,
Hi.,,G_G
Okay.,,CAT
"So, uh, with the issue of trial by jury, uh, I actually found the whole question about whether you need a, a unan-, a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"actually, I, I agree that that's an interesting thing.",,INFO
"I, I believe that's a, for, for civil suits it's not unanimous, right,",,QUESTION
"but for, for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law?",,QUESTION
"I don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because I thought there were cases where, uh, I don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors, but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve.",,CAT
.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I actually thought I'd read that, too",,INFO
and that's why I phrased it that way.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I wonder,",,INFO
"the difference, yeah, the difference could be that for, uh, state, if there is such a thing, state felonies versus federal felonies that federal, things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote,",,INFO
"and things that are under state jurisdiction, even criminal don't require,",,INFO
"but I don't know what the, the laws,",,CAT
"do you think that that's an unreasonable, uh, requirement that they be unanimous?",,QUESTION
"Well, I'd be curious as to what the, uh, requirement for a, an acquittal is.",,CAT
"And I, I don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal.",,INFO
"But I don't know whether you need an, a unanimous, uh, vote of not guilty to acquit.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that, that would be an interesting change.",,INFO
"It was also allow the, uh, idea that if you had one person who was, uh, very disagreeable that, I mean, it, it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because, uh, the fact that it's w-, the, the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt, uh, criterion that it, uh, increases the, the likelihood of getting the proper judgment.",,INFO
"So, I, I think, if anything, it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I'd agree with that.,,INFO
"But I've never had the, the opportunity to serve on a jury, although I've been out here and registered for, I guess, about five years.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
actually,,INFO
"But,",,CAT
"I, I thought that that would be very interesting thing to do.",,INFO
I would like to do that.,,INFO
I've been out here twenty some years,,INFO
"and I've been called, uh, three different times,",,INFO
"but I've never actually even made it into the, the jury box.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"And, because there have always been a number of people",,INFO
"and, and I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions.",,INFO
"Uh, I,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
I also think that would be really good.,,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"Well, the people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is a, you know, something like a nine, three or, or more severe and, and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and in fact, I'm not sure that that's any more, uh, liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than, than anything else.",,INFO
"Well, the, the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this, is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three, or some such number, that there's, an effect starts being that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
going on,,INFO
"and that that, uh, peer pressure,",,INFO
"and in some cases if it's a long trial, the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time, that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I'd,,INFO
"Uh,",,CAT
"read one book, I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things, that, uh",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases, and in many cases looking at what had, at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right, went back to the jurors, uh, based on the deliberations.",,INFO
"Some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict, uh, you know, everyone was getting on them so, so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I understand.",,INFO
"You, you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude, uh, to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response.",,INFO
"I think of the movie, uh, TWELVE ANGRY MEN.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
You ever seen that movie?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
once.,,INFO
"Uh, yeah,",,CAT
"it's, it's, it's exactly that situation where, uh,",,INFO
it's Henry Fonda,,INFO
and it's eleven to one,,INFO
"and he's the one,",,INFO
"I, I believe he was opposed to the conviction",,INFO
"and, uh, and he held on",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
,,
Okay.,,CAT
So what do you guys having up there?,,QUESTION
"I haven't been up there since, oh, Lord, forty-eight, I guess",,INFO
Forty-eight.,,CAT
That's a long time. Uh.,,INFO
"Well, no,",,CAT

Yeah.,,CAT
"We got him a little Jesus doll, uh, about a year ago,",,INFO
and he has always kept that.,,INFO
He likes it,,INFO
"Well, I really like,",,INFO
"now we get channel fifty-five, although we do not have cable,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
we do get channel fifty-five.,,INFO
"And that is a, uh,",,CAT
"like, a, a song,",,CAT
they sing songs on there,,INFO
"but they're, uh, worship through music kind of things.",,INFO
"But they are up to date, uh,",,INFO
"and some of them are like, uh, videos",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"like music videos, that go along with the songs about church and Jesus.",,INFO
"And,",,CAT
"So it's a,",,QUESTION
"And I,",,INFO
a Christian songs?,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, that sounds fun.",,INFO
"The Chri-,",,CAT
it's called the Christian music station or something like that.,,INFO
That's something.,,G_G
"Well,",,CAT
"And, uh, I really like that.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, I turn that on, on Sunday mornings.",,INFO
"And I do not, you know,",,CAT
"and so my kids do not, uh, have an",,CAT
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"Okay,",,CAT
"now when you baby-sit, what age group children do you sit with?",,QUESTION
"Well, gosh",,G_G
"all kinds, um,",,INFO
mostly between the ages of two and ten.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, last, like a few summers ago I kept two children every day for the entire summer",,INFO
"and, I mean, they became like my children",,INFO
I'd think so.,,G_G
"And, um, and they live in an apartment complex",,INFO
so we swam a lot,,INFO
and we played on the playground a lot,,INFO
and then we would go to a movie on Thursdays,,INFO
"and, um, there was always an activity,",,INFO
"you know, they had their favorite T V shows and things like that that we watched",,INFO
and then we took naps,,INFO
"and, um, I don't know",,CAT
"it, it just seems like there was always something to do.",,INFO
Children are so full of energy.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, oh, they were, they just, the-, they just keep you going",,INFO
Now was this a one parent or two parent family?,,QUESTION
"Uh, one parent.",,INFO
One parent.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"She's just,",,CAT
How much time did she spend with them?,,QUESTION
Not much at all,,INFO
"I mean, I would get there at eight o'clock in the morning,",,INFO
the children usually weren't awake by then.,,INFO
And she would get home at like five thirty in the afternoon.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And they would have dinner,,INFO
and then it was time for them to go to bed.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, now at this particular time the children were two and six.",,INFO
"But then I also,",,CAT
"I've been baby-sitting this child, uh, for about eight years,",,INFO
he's nine now,,INFO
"and, um, you know, I've watched him grow up",,INFO
and he's like a little brother to me.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And it's changed over the, over the years, um,",,INFO
we get along a lot better now that he's older.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, we do different things now,",,INFO
we used to play ball a lot,,INFO
"but now it's, he likes to watch T V",,INFO
and he's into wrestling.,,INFO
"And, um, I kept him on Friday night,",,INFO
"we went sh-, we went to go see a movie and, um, things like that",,INFO
"but I feel like, I don't know, when I have children I want to be able to spend a lot of time with them.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
.,,CAT
"you say your, you go to school?",,QUESTION
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
I go to L S U.,,INFO
And what are you studying?,,QUESTION
"Uh, communications.",,INFO
"Well, sounds like your getting a lot of experience in communicating with children",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"I mean, I love children.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, I don't know,",,CAT
"seem, when I was growing up my Mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high.",,INFO
"And I don't,",,CAT
"it would, I think it was very beneficial to us.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean, like in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books",,INFO
and we went skating a lot,,INFO
"and, you know, she was just always there for us,",,INFO
"but nowadays if there are two parents to a family, the mother works just as hard as the father does,",,INFO
and the children either stay at home and get into trouble,,INFO
or they're stuck in a day care.,,INFO
"And I just, I just don't want my children to have to be raised like that.",,INFO
"All my friends, they, their parents worked all the time,",,INFO
they got to stay at home by themselves,,INFO
"and when I was younger I thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"like I couldn't ride my bike across the street, but they could because their Mom would never know it.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But now I realize that it was better because, um, they have got into a lot of trouble,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
because of lack of supervision.,,INFO
"Well, that, that certainly can happen now if",,INFO
"you, you say you're in communications,",,QUESTION
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to?",,QUESTION
"Well, I'm majoring in, uh, public relations.",,INFO
"Public relations,",,CAT
"so,",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"so, you would have a job with a company?",,INFO
"Yes, ma'am.",,CAT
"Rather than, uh, radio or television or newspapers or,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
what have you.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"and, uh, then you'd be willing to give up your job to stay home and with, or stay with the children?",,QUESTION
"Well, I would like to, uh, stay at home with my children for at least the first five years.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But what, what I plan to do in the future is, um, go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and work on my doctorate and teach, um, college,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and in that case then I'll be, I'll be at home when my children are at home,",,INFO
"but I'd like to stay at home with them until they get in, at least into kindergarten,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"where they're at school from what, eight to three or something",,INFO
"and then I would be at my school,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
teaching.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, um,",,CAT
"Well, that, that's, uh, is an advantage of being in the education field.",,INFO
I spent thirty-four years in education.,,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
"and,",,CAT
What grade?,,QUESTION
"so,",,INFO
"oh, I started out with college and then went to high school",,INFO
"and then I preferred the high school age level much better than I did the college,",,INFO
"Oh, did you?",,QUESTION
"because you have a closer relationship with the, uh, students,",,INFO
What did you teach?,,QUESTION
"that,",,INFO
I taught physical education.,,INFO
"Oh, oh, I started out as a P E major,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
in education.,,INFO
I wanted to be a P E teacher.,,INFO
"Well,",,CAT
I sure did.,,INFO
"I, uh, I found that, uh, it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"And, uh, and it worked out fine from that standpoint, uh, plus the fact that, uh, when I left, uh,",,INFO
"usually, uh, my husband was seldom home for maybe forty-five minutes or so",,INFO
"and then our son, he had to get on the bus,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and he did get on the bus,",,INFO
it was his responsibility,,INFO
"and he never ever thought of, uh, not going to school he said, in view of the fact that he was certain I had a hot line to his school.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Because, uh, I, uh,",,INFO
Absolutely.,,CAT
"well, I, I was in physical education then",,INFO
"and I just kept getting pushed into administration,",,INFO
"wound up in administration,",,INFO
"and so,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"he thought surely that I, or I would have bought a hot line,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"to know if he ever skipped school, which, of course, was not the case",,INFO
and I wouldn't have checked on him.,,INFO
"However, uh, there are, there are, points both directions in that, uh, from the standpoint of parents working and not working.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, I listened to more than one parent say I don't know what this child wants.",,INFO
"I'm working two jobs,",,INFO
"they each have their own television,",,INFO
"they each have their own telephone,",,INFO
"they each have their own rooms,",,INFO
"they each have this,",,INFO
they each have that.,,INFO
"I'd say , but what they don't have is you.",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
They need some attention.,,INFO
Absolutely.,,CAT
"And, uh, I think out",,CAT
because that is the way of getting attention.,,INFO
"Well, see whenever my Mom stayed home with us, we did without a lot,",,INFO
"I mean, we were,",,CAT
"it's hard to make it on one income,",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
but we did,,INFO
"and, and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years.",,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
"And, um, you know, we, we only had one car,",,INFO
"we only had one telephone, you know,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
we didn't get to eat out all the time,,INFO
"but I, I feel like that it helped me now because I appreciate the value of the dollar,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and, um, I also had the supervision that I needed while I was growing up,",,INFO
and I hope that I can provide that for my child too.,,INFO
"And we certainly, uh, we need more of that,",,INFO
"we need more parents willing to supervise,",,INFO
"though we've had such a breakdown in the family structure,",,INFO
"Oh, we have.",,CAT
"from the standpoint of, of, uh, church and school and everything along the way.",,INFO
"And that I think has contributed much to, uh, the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that we're having. Uh, that the students', uh, parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very very beginning",,INFO
"and I think my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one, two, and three. To get the students off to a good start let them have positive, um, uh, experiences,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"from the lower levels so they want to continue learning and, uh, keep going and not wait until they're, they're in the ninth and tenth grades,",,INFO
"it's too late then,",,INFO
"you cannot,",,INFO
It is.,,CAT
reverse that trend at that point.,,INFO
"It's way too late,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
I agree.,,CAT
"And, uh, while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school",,INFO
and they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point.,,INFO
"And, that is just as valuable,",,INFO
It is.,,INFO
"at that time, as to the rush in the elementary .",,INFO
"Because all the peer pressure,",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
it starts in high school,,INFO
and the parent really needs to be there for the child.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, uh, the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something.",,INFO
"Uh, we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football",,INFO
"and I did keep statistics for his team,",,INFO
"and,",,INFO
"Oh, great.",,G_G
"his Dad did take movies of the football team and movies of the basketball team,",,INFO
and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, wh-, I feel that I learned a great deal from my students, uh, with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents.",,INFO
"And a thing such as, uh,",,INFO
"one of the biggest complaints I well remember because I spent a lot of time with seniors,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"uh, was, um, carrying their",,INFO
"when I was your age I didn't have this or that,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and I know I never ever said that because I knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people.,,INFO
"Well, I guess that was good that you were, you were hearing it from other students.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
and I had to deal with their problems,,INFO
and I could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect,,INFO
and our son would share this,,INFO
"and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of, of, uh, lines. So that,",,INFO
"Well, um,",,CAT
I think he benefited from my experiences.,,INFO
Does your son work for T I?,,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"he, uh, works, uh, for a different company.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
in the Dallas area,,INFO
"but when he went away to coll-,",,INFO
"and he was on the lawns from the time he was in the seventh grade and, uh, a small and all the way through college",,INFO
"and he held three jobs. Wally was in college * Could this Wally be ""while he . . .""?",,INFO
and we didn't even know it.,,INFO
"Oh, goodness.",,G_G
He didn't even tell us.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"Uh, that he had three jobs",,INFO
but when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account,,INFO
"and, uh, we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go,",,INFO
"if he got married he was on his own,",,INFO
if he flunked out he was on his own ...,,INFO
,,
All right.,,CAT
"Well, um, we lived,",,INFO
"I grew up in San Antonio,",,INFO
"and I was used to the heat,",,INFO
"and I was used to what couldn't grow down there,",,INFO
"and we had a small, um, farm house out in Castroville which is just, uh, to the west of San Antonio",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and we did a lot of gardening out there, and, uh, mostly in raised beds so we could keep the, uh, soil nice, because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil, very hard to, to grow, very hard to cultivate,",,INFO
"and when we came up, here, uh, to California, uh, we're in the Monterrey area,",,INFO
"and it's very, uh, nice sandy soil, rich soil,",,INFO
and the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow,,INFO
How fine.,,G_G
"so we've been out here, well, really in the house since December,",,INFO
"and we've been uh, planting flowers that we could never plant,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"in San Antonio because the heat would just dry them up after, you know, about three good weeks of nice weather before the heat started",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
and here they are supposed to last year around,,INFO
Oh boy.,,G_G
"so we have some really pretty flowers growing,",,INFO
"and, uh, we're at the edge of a forest area, so there's a lot of pine mulch",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Just about anything you would want in Texas as a gardener is here just around us.,,INFO
.,,CAT
We got here at the end of about a four year drought.,,INFO
We've had a whole lot of rain.,,INFO
"Uh, it's been raining pretty much continually now, uh, off and on, maybe one day of break, for about a month.",,INFO
"So,",,CAT
Oh really.,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"we're getting replenished,",,INFO
"and so there is,",,INFO
"when I first came here everything was yellow,",,INFO
the grass was dead everywhere.,,INFO
"And now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous, lush and green and beautiful,",,INFO
and I hope that it holds out here after the summer.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"But, uh, that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening,",,INFO
"and that's about the extent of what we've done, just a little bit on the patio, and waiting for the rain to subside so we can mow.",,INFO
"We, after about a month, we finally got to mow this weekend.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"But, um, we're just so happy to see green.",,INFO
It's just so nice.,,INFO
We haven't really done too much else other than that.,,INFO
"Um. Well we just moved to our first home,",,INFO
and we had lived in a condominium before.,,INFO
So we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties.,,INFO
So we're just learning the ropes here,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But when we moved in, um,",,INFO
"our backyard has so many bi-, tall trees in it that there jus-, there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So we're, you know, going, talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things, and learning about different kinds of grass.",,INFO
"We trying to go, grow grass,",,INFO
"and it just seems so funny to me that, when I grew up in Missouri,",,INFO
and you didn't have to worry about growing grass there.,,INFO
It just happened automatically.,,INFO
So do you have to get a shade tolerant grass?,,QUESTION
"Is that what you're,",,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
We are.,,INFO
"We tried, we planted some fescue last, um, fall",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it's really, really pretty,",,INFO
"and, um, green, * I think this should be part of the previous slash unitwhat follows the conjunction is NOT a clause",,INFO
"it stayed pretty, pretty green throughout the winter,",,INFO
"and it's pretty goo-,",,INFO
"it's not as thick and as nice,",,INFO
"it doesn't look like it can withstand too much, you know.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"Does that last through the summer, too?",,QUESTION
"It's supposed to die off like in August,",,INFO
and then you replant it in September,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"So, but we don't,",,INFO
"the Saint Augustine and all that supposedly was back there just wasn't,",,INFO
"like I say, there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the backyard.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, um, so mostly, you know, we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and flower beds or even gardens, that, we're just saying, let's get some grass",,INFO
Just get grass to grow.,,INFO
Let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much. You know.,,INFO
"Well, when we had our house, um, out in Castroville, the problem with ours is that the, uh, plots there are a third of an acre",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And trying to keep grass alive during a summer on a piece of ground that big was expensive,,INFO
Oh yeah.,,G_G
To water it,,INFO
"and, uh, and eventually, well, especially when it was so bad last year, well, I guess it was the year before now, uh, it was so hot that year,",,INFO
that was the year that I think it started out a hundred in February.,,INFO
Oh no.,,G_G
"Um, we were just watering all the time.",,INFO
"Finally what we did was we said, we're going to have to let the back yard die.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"It's going to have to do whatever it's going to do because,",,INFO
"On its own,",,INFO
we can't really afford the front yard.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And so when we left, you know, the back yard had some, um,",,INFO
I think it was Saint Augustine that we had.,,INFO
"It had held onto a small portion,",,INFO
"but primarily once the weeds start in the back we were just, you know, resigned to, well, the only way we were going to fix this one is that if you plow it all under",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and put everything back on top of it again.,,INFO
"But, I don't know.",,CAT
"That's the bad thing there, is, that we spent so much money,",,INFO
or you would spend so much money trying to keep a large lawn alive.,,INFO
"That was the only thing I didn't like about lawns,",,INFO
"and we were sitting there wondering, there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out.",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
So.,,CAT
"It's pretty remarkable because growing up we've always had a beautiful, lush green lawn,",,INFO
"and we never,",,INFO
there was no such thing as watering your lawns,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
in Missouri.,,INFO
It just happened.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, um, so it's been real fun here to see,",,INFO
"there's a big market for the nurseries and for the landscaping companies,",,INFO
"and a lot of people, um,",,INFO
we live in north of Dallas.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, um,",,CAT
Arlington area.,,INFO
Plano.,,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
Plano.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
up north,,INFO
And so there's a lot of market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the Dallas area,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and big market for, for yards, yard work.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I imagine,,G_G
"So, well everybody, it seems like everyone is so particular, especially in the Dallas area.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"There, there's so much money",,INFO
"and everyone can afford,",,INFO
they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn.,,INFO
"And, another thing I've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes",,INFO
the area is so small,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
that they take great pride in being able to use whatever lawn they do have to look really nice.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
they do.,,INFO
"I noticed that they're really putting in small back yards, because they have these, most of the houses have the alleys",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that run behind,",,INFO
"and, so that really cuts into your backyard space,",,INFO
and. But we don't do our work here out of enjoyment so much as,,INFO
"right now, we're just, this is, we just moved in in September,",,INFO
so we're just still at the point where we're talking about the necessity.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
I know.,,INFO
"Oh, it's awful the first house.",,INFO
"Our house in Castroville was the first one, too.",,INFO
And we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening would run into,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and the time that it took, especially when you start mowing,",,INFO
"and then when it comes to fertilize, then it would come to raking,",,INFO
and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water.,,INFO
"And the one thing that I did notice is that people that have the underground irrigation systems, the sprinkler systems, just, that was the way to go",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
if you could do it.,,INFO
"People that were building the new homes that put those in, that was, that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient.",,INFO
They would just turn it on,,INFO
and the timer would run,,INFO
and it would water their lawn,,INFO
and they didn't have to worry about it at all.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
And that was so nice.,,INFO
"But, we didn't have that luxury,",,INFO
"so we were dragging th-, the sprinkler around everywhere.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"And so, I hope you can find, uh,",,INFO
I don't know what type of grass grows in the real shady areas.,,INFO
"I remember the guy that was on the radio, um,",,INFO
"they had a gardener,",,INFO
"and he,",,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"I had this one, well I've still got the book.",,INFO
"It's, um, I think it's just called TEXAS GARDENING,",,INFO
and it talks about the different grasses to use for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas.,,INFO
Hm.,,CAT
"We,",,CAT
"But there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant,",,INFO
but I don't remember what it is.,,INFO
"But it's got like a boot, on the front of the book.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
It's just a real fancy decorated boot.,,INFO
It's like TEXAS GARDENING.,,INFO
"And it talks about, you know, different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it",,INFO
"and it goes into the full gamut of gardening. You know, everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to, uh, how to prune.",,INFO
"But one of the things I do remember was when it talked about the grass,",,INFO
"Grass,",,CAT
"and there being the shade tolerant types of grass,",,INFO
and I think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"But I don't remem-, I don't remember if it was Raleigh and Saint Augustine or, or what.",,INFO
Or what it was.,,INFO
But I do remember they had used a blend.,,INFO
"Well, we're going to have to do that because we have the shade, the trees,",,INFO
"this is an established and older home that we moved into,",,INFO
"and, um, the trees are just so tall",,INFO
"and there must be ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that like even if its raining, you can go out in our back yard and not get wet",,INFO
"Oh, but that's so neat, because so many homes don't have that.",,INFO
"So you'll be cool all year around,",,INFO
"in the summer, that's great.",,INFO
"Well, that's what we're looking forward to,",,INFO
and that's what they say the payoff is,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"It makes the biggest difference,",,INFO
"Well, we ha-,",,CAT
when you have the big old trees.,,INFO
"And the people that moved in next to us, they built a new house on the empty lot",,INFO
and they just had their brand new little trees.,,INFO
They didn't have any shade,,INFO
"They, any time they had people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during the day.",,INFO
"Too hot,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"So, oh, that's great that you have them.",,INFO
Are they oaks?,,QUESTION
"Well, there are all different kinds.",,INFO
Oh that's even better.,,G_G
"There are some oaks, magnolias, and like plum trees, peach trees,",,INFO
there are some big tall oak trees ...,,INFO
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"you ready to discuss the, the topic?",,QUESTION
What's the topic?,,QUESTION
"Okay,",,CAT
"the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in America and how they relate, or how they differ today than they were ten, fifteen or thirty years ago.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
You ready for that?,,QUESTION
You bet.,,CAT
Okay,,CAT
I'll let you lead out.,,INFO
Pardon me?,,CAT
I'll let you lead out.,,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
"well, there's, uh,",,CAT
it's kind of an interesting topic,,INFO
"and one that I think is quite fascinating because, uh, couple of years ago, I guess, uh,",,INFO
"not very, not very long ago, seemed like the whole world, not just the United States, but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in, uh, you know, a very comfortable position, so to say, even though the, the cold war was, was in full swing. You know,",,INFO
"you had the, the Russians against the Americans, the Communists against the Free World,",,INFO
"and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically, not only on the political front but also on the economic front, where, uh, couple of years ago we had, uh, America was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned,",,INFO
and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period.,,INFO
"We're also have a very humongous trade deficit,",,INFO
"and, uh, and that's kind of frightening.",,INFO
"Also, you know, a couple of years ago, ten, fif-, fifteen, ten, fifteen years ago, an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life,",,INFO
"and thirty years ago, that was, that was basically it, whereas now we're expected to have a career change every, you know, every couple of years and possibly fi-, four to five career changes throughout our lifetime,",,INFO
"and so I think, uh, you know, things,",,CAT
"there's been an awful lot of social change lately,",,INFO
"and we-,",,CAT
"and, uh.",,CAT
I think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"is that the, they seem to be social, they seem to be economically driven also.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So if you look at Russia and what's happened over there, I think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing.",,INFO
"And, of course, I look at the economic problems in the United States right now.",,INFO
One of the things you wonder is what that's going to do to us.,,QUESTION
True.,,CAT
"I think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things, I mean, I think it's great to even have three or four different careers",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
in your life.,,INFO
"I think it must have been terribly boring to go through,",,INFO
.,,CAT
your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
"Some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that, that aspects changing.",,INFO
"True,",,CAT
true.,,CAT
"And the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good,",,INFO
"but, the fact that you really can make major changes in your life",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and jobs.,,INFO
"Well, do, do you think that's good or bad?",,QUESTION
I think it's great.,,INFO
You think that's great.,,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"That's some,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position,",,INFO
"they, they're very comfortable,",,INFO
"they lose the ability to learn,",,INFO
and they in a sense become unteachable.,,INFO
"They think they know all there is to know in the area, set path, and you know, come in and put my time in from nine to five,",,INFO
"and when that's over with, that's, that's it, without even giving a second thought to , advancing their education or getting extracurricular, um, education,",,INFO
"and, and I think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also.",,INFO
"I think one of the problems with, with education as it relates to this, though, is that I don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes.",,INFO
.,,CAT
It just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes, which I think is going to be a hard thing for, for people to face.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"I agree with that,",,CAT
I agree with that.,,CAT
"But I believe that, uh, an individual should really learn how to, to learn",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"learn how to adapt,",,INFO
"learn how to grow in the, in their college or whatever education they might take.",,INFO
"Well, that, that's good,",,INFO
that's good.,,INFO
"There probably needs to be some training on how to, to, to adjust to these changes as they come about.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"I mean if you look at the, the high unemployment rate right now",,INFO
"and you look at people who are in those situations, I don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them, even ideas of how to make those changes now.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So it seems to me that while those changes are taking place, maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress, uh, for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That stress is a very prominent factor in the work place,,INFO
"and it affects,",,CAT
,,
"Nancy, do you have any children?",,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
"I have a twelve year old,",,INFO
and I've been very lucky.,,INFO
I haven't needed child care except for my mom.,,INFO
So,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
I've been real lucky.,,INFO
"I'm a nurse,",,INFO
"I go to school, I mean, I go to work early,",,INFO
so my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for her school or just hangs by while she gets ready,,INFO
"Well, that's nice.",,G_G
"drives her to school,",,INFO
then I'm home to pick her up.,,INFO
"So I'm very, very lucky",,INFO
That is lucky.,,G_G
"Well, how old, um, does a child have to be before you have to, you get to stop making arrangements for him, I wonder.",,QUESTION
"Well, I could do it now.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
But she gets lonely,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"in the morning,",,INFO
and I feel better.,,INFO
"Um, she has a crazy father out there somewhere that I just don't let her out of my sight.",,INFO
"So, um",,INFO
"Well, and, um, it's nice for them",,INFO
you never know.,,INFO
not to be alone.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"she feels that way, you know,",,INFO
and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and go to school with,",,INFO
but we just feel better doing it this way.,,INFO
So.,,INFO
"Not after wor-,",,G_G
I don't know what day we'll stop.,,INFO
"We, we were about to stop one day this year,",,INFO
"and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats,",,INFO
and so,,INFO
"Oh, no.",,G_G
we didn't stop.,,INFO
"And so, so, um, you know, you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen.",,INFO
So,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"even though she's twelve, she's still a kid,",,INFO
so,,INFO
She is.,,G_G
you got to be careful,,INFO
"Well, I'm glad you have that, um, opportunity to have your mom.",,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I'm, I'm glad too",,INFO
"Well, I, I have two kids",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, uh, five and six, a girl and a boy,",,INFO
"and, um, so far I haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because, um, I'm at home now",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
full time.,,INFO
"But, um, when I was going to school, I would go to school a time that my husband wasn't, you know, when he was at home",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
so that we would just switch back and forth like that.,,INFO
"But, um, it's really scary,",,INFO
and I would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care,,INFO
"Well, I would, too, because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside, we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I, I just don't know what I would do if",,INFO
No.,,CAT
I had to do that.,,INFO
I know the hospital that I work in is a big hospital,,INFO
"and they provide child care,",,INFO
and of course they charge for it,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but at least all the nurses can leave their children,",,INFO
"and they're always watching them,",,INFO
"they can eat lunch with them,",,INFO
"if they feel sick they can call them at work and they run over and check on them,",,INFO
and,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way.,,INFO
So. *,,CAT
"Well, that's nice.",,G_G
"Yeah, *",,INFO
it is nice. *,,INFO
"And I know that I have, um, done some babysitting myself,",,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
when I was in school and needed extra money.,,INFO
"And I know how I feel, how I felt as a provider of child care that, even though you're, you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to, you know, treat them equally and, you know, better, usually, better than your own",,INFO
"Right, right *",,CAT
"um, it's not the same,",,INFO
"and it made me realize that, um, no one will love your child as much as",,INFO
Well that's right. *,,INFO
"you and your mother, your",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"and, um, the family",,INFO
"and no one will look out, after them,",,INFO
"and I just think, um, so far I think my preference would be rather than to have like a, oh, a big day care",,INFO
"that, um, what is that like, child, Kinder Care and",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"things like that,",,INFO
"rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something,",,INFO
"I would prefer to have in home care, either my own home or a",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
neighbor or something.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Just never know.,,CAT
"I babysat for the little girl next door for a year or so when her parents first got divorced,",,INFO
and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
it was hard to treat her equally with my child.,,INFO
"They were the same age,",,INFO
"and they played together,",,INFO
"and they were good friends,",,INFO
"but like you said, you tend to go more for the other one's side",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
just because you are responsible,,INFO
and so,,INFO
It is hard.,,INFO
"it, it got hard,",,INFO
my daughter got jealous,,INFO
"and, um, it just wasn't the same as when they were just playing as friends, because she had to be there every day.",,INFO
No.,,CAT
"So I stopped that after a year, because it was difficult",,INFO
No.,,CAT
"to balance it,",,INFO
so.,,CAT
"And I know, um, when I pick my kids up from school they want to come home.",,INFO
And I,,INFO
They do.,,G_G
"and I would hate for them to have, be picked up",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
by a day care,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and be taken to another,,INFO
"I know, I know. *",,CAT
large group situation.,,INFO
"So I think, uh, my preference would be a small, small, if I had to find day care",,INFO
Yeah. *,,INFO
"would be a small, someone that I knew",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, I would rather do without some things *",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and I know that some parents, they both do have to work, *",,INFO
"but a lot of people where I live are working just because they want bigger and better,",,INFO
and I would never do that.,,INFO
No.,,CAT
"I never have done it,",,INFO
and I just never would do it.,,INFO
I would rather do without some things that really aren't very important compared to being with my child when they're growing up.,,INFO
So.,,CAT
"Well, that's true, because even now, when they're gone to school, it seems like there's just not enough time left over *",,INFO
No,,CAT
in the day.,,INFO
"there isn't,",,INFO
"there isn't any time,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"And, uh, by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time,",,INFO
"and, there's just not enough to, time in the day to do anything good quality for them,",,INFO
"but that's really,",,CAT
,,
Ready to talk?,,QUESTION
I guess so,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
"Uh, I want to talk about, um, our family budget,",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"and the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked and,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
give you a general description of it,,INFO
and you can help me out a little *,,COMMAND
bit.,,COMMAND
*,,CAT
Tell me how yours works.,,COMMAND
Okay. *,,CAT
"Well, at the my-,",,CAT
"I introduced you a little bit to it, a few minutes ago, when I said that we are, uh, we're on the east coast now.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"My husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that,",,INFO
"well, we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And so naturally we put ourselves,",,INFO
"we looked at our budget,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and so, what we did was draw up a budget that we thought, uh, was realistic.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, so, we had to make some adjustments",,INFO
"because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that's satisfactory,",,INFO
and we've been here seven months,,INFO
and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently.,,INFO
"Oh, no.",,G_G
"So, you see,",,CAT
That throws the budget out of whack real fast.,,INFO
"Well, we actually planned for about one year.",,INFO
"Oh, good.",,G_G
"Uh, that God because, *",,INFO
Really.,,CAT
it never occurred to,,INFO
That was smart.,,G_G
it never occurred to us that it would take seven months.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, what we did was just, uh, decide wh-, how we had been spending our money before,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and then we put that on the computer,,INFO
"and then we took about three months and, uh, and adjusted,",,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and we really, uh, lessened it, uh, our living expenses, uh, more than what we thought we would.",,INFO
"Wow, that's great.",,G_G
"But,",,CAT
Did you have a special program on your computer to do that,,QUESTION
"or was this just your own design of,",,QUESTION
"Oh, just our own design.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Gosh.,,G_G
"And the,",,CAT
"so, but we've had budgets that didn't work when our, uh, you know,",,INFO
of,,CAT
our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
*,,CAT
"We spent too much money,",,INFO
Yeah. *,,CAT
"until our children went to college,",,INFO
so.,,COMMAND
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, tell me about,",,INFO
"do you all, uh, have a budget?",,QUESTION
"Well, we've been married for five and a half years",,INFO
"and we started out without kids, of course, and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more fun kinds of of things and, uh, did really, um, you know, have a real strict budg-, but, budget",,INFO
"but, uh, the",,CAT
about and,,CAT
"to our,",,CAT
"wh-, wh-, wh-, wh-, when we first got married we were in graduate school",,INFO
"and we were just, you know, dirt poor.",,INFO
Then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house.,,INFO
"So, we virtually did that for about two years,",,INFO
Wonderful.,,G_G
"which worked real well, and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved,",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"and moved to Texas, bought a house immediately, you know, which, of course, is now devalued with the housing market,",,INFO
"so, I don't know if we, we did a good thing to buy a house or not",,INFO
but at least we've got a place to live.,,INFO
"Um, so, now, since, uh, we have a three year old and a two year old now, um,",,INFO
Three and a two year old.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Bang, *",,G_G
bang.,,G_G
"That's, that's, that threw our budget really out of whack too.",,INFO
"An we, um, have been just forced to budget much more because I quit working to be home with the kids.",,INFO
"And, um, we just really have, uh,",,INFO
"I don't know,",,CAT
"we, we've tried different times,",,INFO
"we've done like a survey of like taking, you know, the past three months of where all the money went.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all,",,INFO
"but it seems like there's, um, times when we just have to get out where we'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we'll go and we'll blow, you know, fifty, sixty dollars in one night going out to eat, going to a show or doing something, you know.",,INFO
"Well, I think that's important for your budget to be realis-,",,INFO
"for it to work though, you have to do something.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it, we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week",,INFO
and then it's not really that realistic,,INFO
"because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for, you know, birthday for somebody",,INFO
"or, you know, even we, we even do things real frugally for the kids,",,INFO
"we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age, you know, whether they're JORDACHE new or whether they're *",,INFO
Of course not.,,CAT
"you know, something",,INFO
and they're both boys,,INFO
"so they just one year after the other in each other's clothes,",,INFO
"so. But, um, that's the hardest part for us is that it's really, um, you know, budgeting and some extra things, you know, for-, that are more, you know, nonessential items.",,INFO
"Well, I found, uh, that, in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents.,,INFO
"Uh, we, we tended to want to keep on giving lavish,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"gifts as,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
we had done before.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself, you need to cut down somewhat on your friends.",,INFO
"On your friends,",,CAT
"that's true,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"Well, we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with,",,INFO
we both have older cars,,INFO
"and something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars, you know, on the car in two months or something,",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"and, you know, a lot of things like that that really ar-, are hard to plan for.",,INFO
"And, uh,",,CAT
"Well, I really do,",,CAT
I think you have to budget those things though.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"kind of put in a certain amount per year, *",,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
you're going to have on extra expenses for car.,,INFO
"Exactly,",,CAT
although so much per month anyway.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, that really should be in your bu-,",,INFO
"but if you don't spend it, it should be in your bank account at the end of the month",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions, um, you know, is to,",,INFO
"let's see,",,CAT
"now, I forget which way we do it.",,INFO
We don't list all the deductions,,INFO
"and then we get more money back, you know, at the end of the year,",,INFO
"Oh, no,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
no.,,CAT
"so, that's not a good way to",,QUESTION
You don't want the government to spend your money.,,INFO
"You want to be able,",,CAT
"that's what my husband said,",,INFO
"so this last year he changed it, of course,",,INFO
we didn't get hardly and then nearly as much back,,INFO
"and it was like oh, no.",,INFO
Better find another way of saving money,,INFO
"Well, uh, but I do realize that, that is realistic for some people,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and it was for us many years,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
for many years.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, and if, and if that's the only way that will, it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the, the year then doggone it that's what you should do.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"because we don't miss it,",,INFO
"we really don't, when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff,",,INFO
so.,,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"But we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can en-, envision the, uh, expenses for college already, you know, eighteen years away or whatever.",,INFO
"Well, I was just reading an article in, uh, a North Carolina pap-, paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at, uh, letters of applications to universities.",,INFO
Gosh.,,G_G
"She was o-, she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty,",,INFO
"so, it can be done.",,INFO
"I guess,",,CAT
"Where there's a will,",,QUESTION
that's fantastic.,,G_G
"where there's a will, there's a way, right?",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
"Well, I have enjoyed talking to you.",,G_G
"Well, I enjoyed talking to you too,",,G_G
good luck,,G_G
and don't spend any money this weekend,,G_G
"Oh, I know",,G_G
we'll have to stay home and mow the yard,,G_G
"Oh, boy.",,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
Bye.,,G_G
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"as far as, uh, universal health care",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"um, I guess I'm all for it.",,INFO
"I think it's time that we start looking at, uh, getting into that.",,INFO
"Um, health cost has continued to rise",,INFO
"and I think, uh, there's people that to me it's the fundamental, uh,",,INFO
.,,CAT
life of a person.,,INFO
"Uh, it doesn't matter if you have money or no mone-, or all the money in the world, um,",,INFO
"you would,",,CAT
You should still be,,INFO
Everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits.,,INFO
"Um, I think if, uh, they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and, uh, individuals, um, helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how.",,INFO
"But, uh, the expenses right now for health care, um, are just unreal.",,INFO
"Well, they really are even for, even when you're not talking about surgery.",,INFO
"If you're just talking about basic care,",,INFO
we've,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
we've got four children,,INFO
"and, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
in the past month,,INFO
"Oh, sure.",,CAT
"they, it just, they pass things from one to one",,INFO
and it just can devastate,,INFO
"And your constantly,",,INFO
"your budget, you know.",,INFO
Exactly.,,G_G
Um,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"The only,",,CAT
"I, I know that, um, uh, I know a little bit about the, uh, European, uh, universal health care",,INFO
and there's some pros and cons.,,INFO
"One of the things, of course, is everybody gets health care,",,INFO
"but, uh, sometimes health care, uh, when you get into a universal system lacks in, uh, what would be considered, uh,",,INFO
how can I say it?,,CAT
"Um, over like in Poland, uh, where my father-in-law lived for years there their health care system is, um,",,INFO
because no financial gains are available for doctors.,,INFO
"Uh, they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason,",,INFO
but most people that go in to being a physician here in the U S do it for financial gain.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"They say, well, jeez. If I get into this area of dermatology, I don't have to do this,",,INFO
"I can do this,",,INFO
"and I can, you know,",,INFO
Can still make big bucks,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
or plastic surgery,,INFO
"or, uh, if I become a, uh, heart specialist I'm going to make this kind of money, uh,",,INFO
"and there's, you know, financial gains toward that.",,INFO
And in a universal system I don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors.,,INFO
"Do you think that the quality, um",,QUESTION
The quality,,INFO
it would,,INFO
I think,,INFO
would be as high?,,INFO
goes down. Uh-huh,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
when you have a universal system.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Um, the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check, um, and also offering some kind of,",,INFO
"because I think, uh, all physicians, well, anybody, um, likes the ability to kind of, uh, get themselves financially, uh, situated.",,INFO
"Uh, I guess that's the whole U S concept",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"is to come here and,",,INFO
More motivation,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
and I don't know if you can have that with a universal system.,,INFO
"Maybe, you know, there's a way of working that out,",,INFO
but I know that in Poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it.,,INFO
That's what they look at it as.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"There's no, uh,",,CAT
"and that's sad because if that's the case, if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
But,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind.,,INFO
That's true.,,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
So.,,CAT
"I, uh,",,CAT
"But I, I think we have to head toward that way.",,INFO
"Well, we're going to have to do something because there's just too many people in the country that are uninsured",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, and you know you cannot,",,INFO
"I mean it's just,",,CAT
I'm worried when I get older.,,INFO
"Oh, sure.",,G_G
"You know, and, uh, let's say for instance you, uh, get fired or not fired but maybe laid off from your job.",,INFO
You no longer have insurance.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
I mean and you're sixty some or,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"fifty some years old you try, try to find insurance.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"I mean y-, you're uninsurable.",,INFO
That's right.,,G_G
"Unless you want to pay five hundred, six hundred dollars a month",,INFO
"and I know people that are paying two hundred, three hundred dollars a month for insurance.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And how they can do it I have no idea.,,INFO
"Um, I know working for small corporations",,INFO
"and health insurance, um, myself, um, it would cost for a family",,INFO
"and this was back three, four years ago to put my entire family up",,INFO
"and this was working for like a med center, uh, health plan.",,INFO
"Um, it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"Well, our ours is three hundred for our family",,INFO
"and I mean we, that is, we pay that instead of a car payment.",,INFO
See.,,CAT
You know.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I mean I'm driving a piece of junk, you know",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Well, we do the same.",,INFO
"I mean it's,",,CAT
"I think, uh, people are changing their viewpoints of, you know,",,INFO
it's getting harder and harder to survive.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"And, uh",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and that's why, uh, if they don't go to a universal system, something is going to happen.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"We're going to have, uh, a larger amount of people dying.",,INFO
,,
Well I haven't had too much of a chance to watch T V lately.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
So probably everything I going to say is kind of dated.,,INFO
"Well, I can understand that.",,G_G
It's that time of the year.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"We just, my wife and I just recently moved into our house.",,INFO
So we're,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things. But.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Um, like to keep up to date too.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I guess, in the,",,CAT
"since I got out of college, which was about five years ago, my T V viewing started to tend more towards, uh, documentary, news programs, things like that.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Something that's going to keep mu up to date.,,INFO
"I've kind of, kind of gotten away from, uh, being a series watcher, having to keep up to date with, uh,",,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"I think when you're in college you kind of, you have more of a regular schedule",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"in terms of, you can watch every week.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that makes a big difference.,,INFO
"So, yeah,",,CAT
"I, I used to,",,CAT
"when my kids were real little and I was home, I watched,",,INFO
where I was home where I watched things on a more regular basis.,,INFO
"But right now, the last things I watched regularly was THIRTY SOMETHING when it first came out.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
Did you all ever watch that?,,QUESTION
"I, yeah, I started, too, and, uh",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"kind of, kind of worked away from that.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I, I have a hard time sticking with something",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"like, like on T V, because, it, like, it gets real aggravating if you miss it, for a week or two.",,INFO
You feel kind of left out,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"But, um, right.",,CAT
"I know,",,CAT
"but I tell you what, um,",,CAT
"we're really strict with our kids about television,",,INFO
"and one night, couple weeks ago, it was just happened that we were exhausted",,INFO
"and they wanted to watch,",,INFO
"and we said okay, well we'll sit down",,INFO
"and we'll, you know, look at what you want to see.",,INFO
Let's just turn it on and see what's on.,,INFO
We could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it.,,INFO
I believe that.,,G_G
"So, you know, it was prime time,",,INFO
"it was, what, seven thirty, eight o'clock on a week night",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"and we have cable,",,INFO
"and there wasn't anything on any channel,",,INFO
"and the stuff that was on the prime, the networks, you know, A B C, N B C, C B S, was,",,INFO
"it was just, um, dribble",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, I mean, it wasn't even funny",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"it wasn't creative,",,INFO
"it, it was the worst I've seen.",,INFO
"I mean, I have not watched prime time, week night T V, I guess in a real long time",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
because I was shocked.,,INFO
I know exactly how you feel.,,G_G
You know what I'm saying.,,QUESTION
That's right.,,CAT
"I, uh, when I first moved down here, moved into the apartment and got cable, and I guess I sort of, kind of became numb.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the T V, you know.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"And then all of a sudden, I started paying, paying attention to network T V again, once in a while.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Right now we don't have cable.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
And it's surprising how much it's changed,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"the whole moral situation, everything, is just gone one whole complete direction different.",,INFO
"And we don't have any kids yet,",,INFO
but I feel the same way.,,INFO
It's really tough to find something that's,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"going to be good and interesting for the kids. Even, even cartoons, um",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"you know, you watch some of the cartoons,",,INFO
and kids,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"aren't, aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there.",,INFO
"It's,",,CAT
"none of it's probably damaging, lot of times.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"it's just, it's just, uh, like a necessary evil.",,INFO
"I mean, when we, when our children were younger, when they were like four years old, three years old, five years old, we just had Sesame Street",,INFO
"and that was about it, you know.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"But now, in order to seem, you know, humane and normal, we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But it's, just one of those things, you know,",,INFO
"you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something, because those drive you crazy, if you're, if you're in the room.",,INFO
"So,",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"But it's such a shame, because it could be so good.",,INFO
"I don't understand why, first of all, the public puts up with it.",,INFO
"Well, that's true.",,CAT
"Second of all, why the networks think that, you know, we enjoy that kind of stuff.",,INFO
It's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that.,,INFO
That can't be the problem.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"It must be the marketing pressures,",,INFO
"and, you know, their demographic studies that they do that show, you know, that everybody's I Q has dropped dramatically or something.",,INFO
I'm glad you said it,,INFO
and I didn't have to.,,INFO
"But that, that, that's the,",,CAT
I feel the exact same way.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"I sit, I sit and watch some shows,",,INFO
and I'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show.,,INFO
I know.,,G_G
"You know, why do you do this to yourself?",,QUESTION
Why do you do this?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"I know,",,CAT
"I'm trying to think if there's anything I do,",,INFO
"you, like, uh, I like stuff that's on Great Performances,",,INFO
"and, I, we used to watch mystery quite a bit",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
and things like that.,,INFO
"Stuff I guess that mostly public, on public T V.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"As a matter of fact, you know when I was a kid, excuse me, my parents used to have,",,INFO
"we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular T V that we watched, we had to watch an hour of public T V",,INFO
Now there's an idea.,,G_G
That was just the rule.,,INFO
"And if they saw us watching the, something,",,INFO
"they'd say, all right, what did you see on WHAT'S NEW,",,INFO
"or there was some other,",,INFO
the children's program I think at the time was called WHAT'S NEW.,,INFO
"Okay,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
So we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
That's pretty good.,,G_G
"Do you, do you watch sports on T V?",,QUESTION
Are you a sports fan?,,QUESTION
I can't handle it very long.,,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
"I, I mean, I'm, I'm a sports fan,",,CAT
"but it's, well, it's kind of, it's kind of like reading magazines any more.",,INFO
"If half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials, it probably wouldn't be so bad.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, it, it's,",,CAT
you're missing an awful lot.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I'd rather, personally rather watch, see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium.",,INFO
"but uh,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's true,",,CAT
the traffic.,,CAT
"But, uh, no,",,CAT
Uh.,,CAT
"I don't sit down,",,INFO
"I'll sit down for the big games, the Super Bowl, and the championship",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know, things like that.",,INFO
But I don't follow any team.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I check the scores the next morning,",,INFO
"and I know how everybody's doing,",,INFO
and that suffices me.,,INFO
"But,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I like, I like good comedy, good humor once in a while.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I enjoy that,",,INFO
"but what do you, where do you",,QUESTION
Well,,CAT
do you get that come-.,,INFO
"You don't have cable now,",,QUESTION
I was going to say they have a comedy channel now.,,INFO
"But again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly, uh, commercials,",,INFO
and then,,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"you're, you know, trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up.",,INFO
You know what I did.,,QUESTION
There was a time there where I could tape things,,INFO
and then I'd fast forward through the,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
commercials.,,INFO
Saved a lot of time that way.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it works,",,CAT
"you bet,",,G_G
yeah.,,CAT
"But, that takes too much planning.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"no,",,CAT
"I don't know,",,CAT
"if there's any, any series that I pay attention to, I try to watch CHEERS once in a while.",,INFO
"Now that, yeah, is that still real good.",,INFO
It used to be real good.,,INFO
But.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
it is.,,CAT
Is it.,,G_G
"In fact, it's, I think it's on tonight",,INFO
Oh,,CAT
"I just got in from outside,",,INFO
so I,,CAT
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
so I'm kind of out of it.,,INFO
"Things like that,",,INFO
and I consider that fairly intelligent humor.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
You know.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You can tell,",,INFO
they pick up the words every once in a while.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
Isn't it such a long running program.,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"they do have a good, they do have good writers for that.",,INFO
"Oh, that makes me think,",,INFO
do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE at all?,,QUESTION
I try to.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"we try to stay up, too",,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
It's getting harder and harder.,,INFO
Ten years ago wasn't so hard to stay up.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you know, it was, it was just automatic, too,",,INFO
no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it.,,INFO
I think it's come around again.,,INFO
It's gone through cycles.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it was,",,CAT
"we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there,",,INFO
but we started watching again.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
But it's real different show than it was when it started.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It's funny now,",,INFO
"and it's better,",,INFO
but it's real different,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
than what it used to be.,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"But you can't be so, can't be outrageous.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"You know, if you keep that same format.",,INFO
There's only so long that you can be outrageous.,,INFO
"So,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that's for sure, that is for sure.",,G_G
"Well, I guess there are a few things around still",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
but you have to hunt hard for them.,,INFO
Sounds like you pretty much agree.,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
I guess so.,,INFO
Well.,,CAT
Well.,,CAT

Uh-huh.,,CAT

"but as far as, uh, the quality seems to be there, um, it's quiet, it's, it handles well, um,",,INFO

You're kidding.,,G_G
"But, you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone",,INFO
and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt,,INFO
"and I said I can't imagine,",,INFO
"I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he had done it, yeah,",,INFO
"I guess I could convict him,",,INFO
but I can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
But they really did.,,INFO
"It was, it was",,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
really amazing.,,INFO
"Well, I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun,",,INFO
"Well, that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about.",,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
And those jurors don't know about.,,INFO
"But this particular case, I mean, they had a complete confession from the guy",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"with a lot of things that, that the police hadn't released",,INFO
so no one else would have known.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"It was, it was really pretty interesting.",,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"What,",,CAT
Educational.,,INFO
"I guess cases like that, I don't see why they wouldn't bring in the new evidence from the other case.",,INFO
"Well, they can't, they can, I think in the punishment phase",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been, he hasn't been found guilty of it.",,INFO
Of that crime,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"but he was found guilty of anoth-,",,INFO
okay.,,CAT
"Right,",,CAT
so,,INFO
That works.,,INFO
"you know, it's, although, it's not going to take much",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
to prove that.,,INFO
"So,",,CAT
"Well, they pushing the death penalty?",,QUESTION
"Uh, yeah,",,CAT
this guy is up for the death penalty.,,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"Uh, and in Texas there is, there is a couple of questions you have to ask, uh, in the punishment phase.",,INFO
"Uh, for example, was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation",,INFO
And there is a number of questions,,INFO
"and just depending on whether you say yes or no, uh, you, you can give him capital punishment",,INFO
"and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment, then you can look at mitigating circumstances.",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
"So there is a lot of outs,",,INFO
"but the only result is, otherwise he gets life in prison.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
and I'm really kind of against life in prison anyway,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
because it costs so dog gone much.,,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
"and, and to me, I mean, you take away a person's freedom, you've taken away most of their life.",,INFO
That's true.,,G_G
"I mean, if you're going to put him in prison for life",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"but,",,CAT
"with no chance for parole,",,INFO
But then you have to look at reality.,,INFO
"I mean, I think, you know, normally they, they may get out",,INFO
"so,",,CAT
That's true.,,G_G
But what is it worth?,,QUESTION
I don't know.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Personally I don't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself.,,INFO
That's true.,,G_G
"I mean, I don't know whether I'd stay in prison or not",,INFO
"or,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"so, you said you're from Mississippi?",,INFO
"Yes, ma'am.",,CAT
And do they have the death penalty there?,,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
they do.,,INFO
"I,",,CAT
"they've had a, a number of cases here.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean, not a whole lot,",,INFO
"well, Jackson, I heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
It was like last like year they had forty-nine,,INFO
so that's going up.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, yeah,",,CAT
they have a death penalty.,,INFO
I hear of one every now and then.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And I visited the prison up here,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, at Parchman",,INFO
"and I've been,",,CAT
"I haven't,",,CAT
"they won't let you on death row,",,INFO
but they'll let you look down the hall.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
You can't see any prisoners,,INFO
"and, and it's kind of a weird feeling.",,INFO
I've been,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"they took us around on a tour, you know,",,INFO
"and I went, got to walk in the gas chamber",,INFO
Ooh.,,G_G
"and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you're sitting there saying, like, people have died here.",,INFO
That's right.,,G_G
"But I guess, just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff, the people up there,",,INFO
,,
"Well, what kind of garden do you have?",,QUESTION
"Well, we've tried having,",,INFO
"let me turn the T V off,",,CAT
"we've tried having a vegetable garden,",,INFO
"and I'm from Chicago,",,INFO
"and the way that, uh, bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from Chicago.",,INFO
.,,CAT
.,,INFO
"And we have tried several years in a row,",,INFO
"and we've given up, between the fire ants, the pill bugs, the weeds, the drought, and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer,",,INFO
"and we just kind of, uh, decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"We had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought, Who'd want to eat that stuff.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
"You know, so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here,",,INFO
"and, uh, if you really water a lot, you can do it,",,INFO
"but, you know, when you have to pay for water, it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So, right now we're just,",,INFO
Do you have a lawn?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"we, we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now, and the trees.",,INFO
.,,CAT
We have a peach tree.,,INFO
"That's the extent of our, um, contributing to our food supply.",,INFO
But that's nice to have,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
So what do you do up there?,,QUESTION
"Well, um, actually it,",,CAT
we've sort of had an ideal Spring.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"And, um, the, the peonies have been out for now about three weeks",,INFO
"Oh, wow.",,G_G
"and the roses have been blooming for two weeks,",,INFO
"and the grass is, uh, this lush green,",,INFO
"and of course I've got lots of weeds in mine because,",,INFO
.,,CAT
I don't use any poison either.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, um, you know, I just keep looking at,",,INFO
"and I say, Jeez, you know, this is the first year it's been so perfect.",,INFO
Really.,,CAT
Gosh.,,G_G
"But, and my garden, you know,",,CAT
my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall,,INFO
"Oh, boy",,G_G
"the plants and,",,CAT
that sounds wonderful.,,G_G
"you know, I'm g-, I'm going, Gee, this can't, you know,",,INFO
we'll have a freeze.,,INFO
If you don't have a frost you'll be all right,,INFO
.,,CAT
"That's what I remember from living up north, is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost",,INFO
"and half the stuff would get frostbitten,",,INFO
and you'd have to.,,INFO
"Well, that's it.",,G_G
"Last year, I think it was, you know, my peonies were, were, budding in January,",,INFO
"and, you know, there was no way that was going to make it,",,INFO
"and sure enough, you know, we d-, had really mild weather until",,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
I think it was May or something,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and then, you know, everything just got hit hard",,INFO
"Oh, boy,",,G_G
that's frustrating.,,G_G
"So, but yeah,",,CAT
"it, it's interesting,",,INFO
and I enjoy gardening.,,INFO
My son does the mowing of the grass.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,CAT
"my husband does that, thank goodness, because I, that's not a pleasure for me",,INFO
"I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody, the m-, the mowing.",,INFO
"I love gardens that are well tended,",,INFO
"and I just,",,CAT
"there's been a few different places I've lived where I've just n-,",,INFO
"I don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what, but you could just tell that they had a love, uh, a love affair with their gardens, with beautiful wild flowers,",,INFO
"and just,",,CAT
"I love the host of colors that just keep coming all, you know, year long.",,INFO
"And, uh, I, I was in England once,",,INFO
"and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had, they had a beautiful garden in it.",,INFO
"You know, it could be three feet by four feet or something.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So I do admire that, but I haven't really put, uh, too much energy into it.",,INFO
.,,CAT
Course we have two little kids that are two and three years old,,INFO
"Oh, they help you.",,INFO
"So that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry, I'll tell you",,INFO
Oh dear.,,G_G
"Oh but that's nice, you know,",,INFO
"I mean the peach tree is, is a start",,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"Tha-,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
that's really lovely.,,INFO
I would love to have different fruit trees.,,INFO
"It's, it's been wonderful to have the peaches.",,INFO
They're just delicious.,,INFO
"And, we, we ha-, we have, still have to spray some,",,INFO
"but we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison, which is good,",,INFO
"because I just,",,CAT
I can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"What about tomatoes,",,QUESTION
aren't they pretty hardy?,,QUESTION
"Um, we've tried them,",,INFO
"but again, it's just like the sun scorch.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"We've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the s-,",,INFO
"I mean it's just,",,CAT
"you really, really",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer.,,INFO
People that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"and installed that,",,INFO
"and um, that's really what makes the most sense,",,INFO
"because you don't have to use so much water,",,INFO
and,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
it really does the job.,,INFO
But it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here.,,INFO
.,,CAT
"And if you're not really committed to it,",,INFO
"I mean, me, I'm, you know, I'm real committed to it for about a week, and then I forget about it for a week,",,INFO
"and then I go, Oh, yeah, I need to do something,",,INFO
"and by then it's burned up, you know.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"It's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives,",,INFO
"so maybe when I get older I'll find, uh, some joy in that",,INFO
"Well, I would a-, assume, too,",,INFO
"I mean, you've got three or four months you're talking about",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"of, of bad weather.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
it just gets so hot so fast here.,,INFO
We don't have really a Spring or a Fall,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it just, uh, immediately heats up.",,INFO
"So, that's one thing I miss about living up north, as I remember, um, you know, the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather.",,INFO
It was really nice.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"We always had gardens when I was, uh, living in Chicago.",,INFO
"In fact, my mother once tore up our entire back yard",,INFO
.,,CAT
and redid it.,,INFO
I'll never forget.,,INFO
"Got my stepfather to put in, uh, a waterfall and a little pond in one corner.",,INFO
"I mean, that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time I ever knew him",,INFO
They remodeled the entire back yard.,,INFO
"Then they sold the house and got divorced,",,INFO
so I don't know what that says about it all,,INFO
"Oh, dear.",,G_G
"Oh, but she used to love to do stuff like that.",,INFO
Sounds like it would have been pretty.,,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
it really was.,,INFO
I enjoyed it there.,,INFO
"But maybe when the boys get a little older, we'll do some more planting,",,INFO
because they like to see things grow.,,INFO
"They've done a couple of little seed projects,",,INFO
and so I think it would be fun for them.,,INFO
"Oh, sure,",,G_G
sure.,,G_G
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"Well, it sounds like you, you've got your hands full",,INFO
"Oh, yes",,CAT
They're both running around now.,,INFO
"And, you know, gardening isn't, isn't high on the list,",,INFO
but it's not off the list.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"well, it's very therapeutic,",,INFO
"I think, really to get out there and dig in the dirt,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
you know.,,INFO
They certainly enjoy that part of it,,INFO
.,,CAT
It's just trying to keep anything.,,INFO
"I planted bulbs last, uh, Fall on the side guard, and when I went out there in the Spring",,INFO
"and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off,",,INFO
and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"He thought, what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with?",,INFO
.,,CAT
"At least he didn't eat them,",,INFO
"I mean, I guess I could be thankful for that.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Maybe next year they'll do better.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
really.,,CAT
If they survive this year.,,INFO
"Oh, well, good luck to you.",,G_G
"Okay,",,G_G
"well, thanks.",,G_G
Nice talking to you.,,G_G
It was nice talking to you too.,,G_G
Bye-bye.,,G_G
,,
There you go.,,CAT
What do you think invades your privacy?,,QUESTION
"Oh, well people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something. You know, that, that try to sell you the s-, newspaper, and, uh, wha-, carpet cleaning, and, uh, what else, roof repair",,INFO
"And enough,",,CAT
"well I think it's a waste of paper, the people that always leave, uh, junk mail and, because, um, you just end up throwing it away most of the time.",,INFO
"Probably eighty percent of the, the junk mail that you get is, is, um, something that you don't need.",,INFO
And the same way with those calls.,,INFO
"What is it,",,CAT
"oh M C I, M C I really does.",,INFO
"Even when you tell them no, they keep calling back.",,INFO
M C I,,CAT
what's that?,,QUESTION
M C I,,CAT
it's the long distance telephone company.,,INFO
"Oh, now see I, I really don't have much trouble with, I just say no thank you and hang up.",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"well they wo-, they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason.",,INFO
They just keep calling back.,,INFO
"I had a carpet service call up three times,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"all within in an hour,",,INFO
"but, I, uh, I do telemarketing,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"so, uh, I'm very polite",,INFO
"and I just say no thank you, and say no thank you very politely",,INFO
"and I hang up and,",,INFO
Uh,,CAT
don't bother me after that.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
So I think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me,,INFO
and they try to get information out of me.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Like the Census Bureau, United States Census Bureau.",,INFO
Oh yeah.,,CAT
That bothered me.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
That I think is my invasion privacy because it's the government,,INFO
and I don't understand what their need to know is.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy. If somebody wants personal information out of me,",,INFO
"but telephone calls I figure, they don't bother me one way or the other.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I know when I do telemarketing, um, I'm a soft person,",,INFO
"if, if someone says I am not interested I'll just say fine and back out.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I make very good sales,",,INFO
"but I'm not, uh, as I said, I'm not half as pushy as these people because, I don't really care.",,INFO
"I mean, if, if they're not interested fine.",,INFO
You know that's it.,,INFO
You can't force them to be.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
No.,,INFO
"And I'm not pushing something down their throat that, uh, I don't think is a good item anyway.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
That I don't think I could do anyway.,,INFO
"But I feel like, oh, movie stars, or",,CAT
"sure, it's part of their, I guess they're portray being a movie star",,INFO
they get themselves in these rag sheets,,INFO
"but, uh, I think they go too far.",,INFO
"Oh, yeah",,CAT
I think that's invasion of privacy.,,INFO
because they follow them around twenty-four hours a day.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
And you know they do Ted Kennedy.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"Of course, he's breaking the law all the time,",,INFO
so it's a different story then.,,INFO
"You know, but, but Ed McMahon, I mean, you know, who cares about Ed McMahon.",,QUESTION
"He's probably hasn't done anything interesting in the last thirty years that they've been on the air,",,INFO
.,,CAT
you know.,,INFO
And he has a chauffeur.,,INFO
Maybe he drinks,,INFO
"but he never drives a car either, you know,",,INFO
it's not the same with Johnny Carson.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
"I think my, seriously my classification of, of invasion of privacy is trying to get personal information,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and putting it falsely out or just bombarding me for the answers.,,INFO
"Without your, and without your permission.",,QUESTION
Right.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"This to me is, is my invasion of privacy.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Anytime I can honestly say no, or, throw the paper away, or,",,INFO
"but you can always write to, uh, oh I forgot the name of it and stop the junk mail.",,INFO
"That I've done. Because I don't want junk mail anyway,",,INFO
"so I c-, wrote to them when it came on the air,",,INFO
"so I don't get any of that bull,",,INFO
"tha-, it works by the way.",,INFO
"Oh, good.",,G_G
"But, uh, the telephone doesn't bother me because I leave it half the time, on, uh, you know, answering service anyway,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"unless I'm home,",,INFO
"so I figure I can turn it off one way or the other,",,INFO
but I think that's the only bottom line thing that I dislike.,,INFO
"Because it does,",,CAT
"other than the U S Census, um,",,INFO
what was it.,,CAT
"Oh the, the carpet place that called me three times,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that I felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place, and called me three times.",,INFO
.,,CAT
I mean one should be sufficient.,,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
"But, if people don't use the telephone,",,CAT
it's like I don't know when the police has their project going,,INFO
and I don't know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things.,,INFO
That's the only way I know.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, that's i-,",,CAT
"Well you have to have the telephone,",,INFO
"but you can't, you know,",,CAT
"and, and it's, sometimes it's hard to screen out all the calls that you don't want.",,INFO
"Well see there's no way of knowing,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that's, you know, that's the problem.",,INFO
"Like the product I sell, uh, I sell mostly to older people which can't get it in a normal public situation.",,INFO
The only way we'd get to them is by telephone.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"And, uh, most of them like it because the company I work for is nationwide, and, uh, reputable",,INFO
"and they know that hey, we're backing it, one hundred percent.",,INFO
"Ye-, uh-huh.",,CAT
"But, if we were denied the right to call people up, these people would never be able to get it.",,INFO
"Because your normal companies that offer it, do not offer it in the amounts that we do",,INFO
"and they'd never have it then, at that point.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Because we offer it in a very low, you know, quantity.",,INFO
.,,CAT
"So I mean, I, I don't know what to do as far as that's concerned.",,INFO
But it is nerve racking.,,INFO
"I mean it is nerve racking to have the telephone,",,INFO
"but at least, as I said, you can always say no thank you",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
uh-huh.,,CAT
I gather you get a lot of telephone calls.,,INFO
"Sometimes,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
some days it just rings off the wall.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
"yes,",,CAT
yes.,,CAT
In other words you own your own home.,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
no.,,CAT
I think that's where they hit most of us.,,INFO
Like I own my own home.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And you just know about what time,",,INFO
"like some days I hate staying home because the phone rings all the time,",,INFO
"but, uh, I don't know,",,CAT
I haven't been able to figure that out.,,INFO
Something else to do about it.,,INFO
"When they call up and want to say, well tell me this, this, this, this and I'll give you a free something or other,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"My answer is no thank you, I don't need it.",,INFO
"And they say, well don't you want to know what's free,",,INFO
"and I s-, no",,INFO
"If I have to give them so much to answer the questions to get fifty rolls of film or something like that, they're taking something away from me",,INFO
and I don't like that.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
"even if, I guess it's for coupons, they, they have a survey they run",,INFO
"and it, I guess it, one of them is supposed to be a smokers survey",,INFO
but the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And they ask, tha-, you know, they start out",,INFO
"and they ask you even, even to your income level.",,INFO
"I think that's, you know,",,INFO
"whether you buy a T V dinner or not, I don't think it has anything to do with,",,INFO
,,
Hi.,,G_G
"Hi, uh,",,G_G
"as a matter of fact this past weekend, since we had a long weekend, I, uh, took on a painting project in my bathroom",,INFO
"and I had wallpaper up,",,INFO
I had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that,,INFO
and it took me all weekend,,INFO
"because, uh, the wallpaper, getting it off, I had to wet the walls down",,INFO
and that had to dry.,,INFO
And then the spackling had to dry a day,,INFO
and then the painting took another day.,,INFO
"You didn't try re-, rewallpapering?",,QUESTION
"You just, uh,",,CAT
No.,,CAT
"I, I just painted.",,INFO
Did you use a textured paint,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Uh, no.",,CAT
"Actually, the wall behind the paper was smooth",,INFO
"so, I just used a, like a semigloss.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"And,",,CAT
"Well, did you get good results?",,QUESTION
"Well, no,",,CAT
not really.,,CAT
"I need to,",,INFO
"it, it looks so,",,INFO
.,,CAT
bad you can see where those spackling marks were.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I need to, uh, either paper back over it or do something",,INFO
"But it just didn't, it didn't, it didn't cover it?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
It covered the spots pretty good,,INFO
"but it didn't, excuse me, it didn't, uh, uh, it just didn't look as smooth as I wanted it to.",,INFO
"Well, we did a, uh,",,INFO
"we moved, oh, last August",,INFO
"and we're getting a house,",,INFO
my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den,,INFO
"and we decided,",,CAT
"we went to, I've forgotten , one of the paint stores",,INFO
"and they just said, oh, you can get by,",,INFO
"and I forgotten what it was you put down, and then you can just paint right over the dark.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Well, more or less.",,INFO
"After about, uh, half dozen coats it looks reasonable",,INFO
"but it kept,",,CAT
"the, the dark",,CAT
"it was, uh, just a real dark, uh, wood grain type paneling",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and it was smooth,,INFO
"and, uh, and we would, we put this stuff on",,INFO
"and, and it supposedly textured it or did something to it",,INFO
"and, but because of the b-, dark behind it, it was really hard to cover",,INFO
and,,CAT
Was it like a primer?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"It was something like that, although, we sort of, when we got through I wished we hadn't done it",,INFO
"because we were, you know, we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it",,INFO
"and we were painting it and trying to do, uh, you know, make it,",,INFO
"and it, it really was, you know,",,INFO
"the advice they give you is, uh,",,CAT
the job was considerably tougher than we thought.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, particularly when you try to,",,CAT
"I was talking to somebody else who, who had a lot of wood panelling",,INFO
"and, uh, they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate",,INFO
"and it seemed like there was, it was a good sized den with a lot panelling",,INFO
and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something.,,INFO
"Oh, my goodness,",,G_G
that's an awful lot.,,G_G
"Have you, have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted?",,QUESTION
Not inside.,,CAT
"Now, uh, when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it.",,INFO
"That was one of the requirements from, you know, F H A",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
that the house be painted before we bought it,,INFO
and it was fairly reasonable.,,INFO
We have a brick house,,INFO
but all the trim,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"around the house was, uh,",,INFO
"if I remember right, it was like five hundred dollars.",,INFO
"Oh, that's quite reasonable.",,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
.,,CAT
so that wasn't too bad.,,INFO
"Um, problem i-,",,CAT
"have you, have you tried matching paint lately?",,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
I haven't.,,INFO
"My wife,",,CAT
"we, we built a shed over the long way ,",,INFO
"actually, it took,",,INFO
this is not on the topic,,INFO
but I did finish it.,,INFO
"But my wife went to the, uh, Home Depot, I think it was, and, and took a, uh, a copy, took a piece of brick",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and she wanted to paint the shed,,INFO
"it's, it's a wooden shed, uh,",,INFO
and she took it,,INFO
and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, they got,",,INFO
"and, uh, and, in fact she put some right ba-,",,INFO
"she got,",,INFO
"they mixed, uh, a gallon of it",,INFO
"and, uh, it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint, uh,",,INFO
"and it does it, uh, oh, electronically some, something,",,INFO
"Oh,",,CAT
"so,",,QUESTION
magic.,,INFO
they did do a good job?,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you know, they,",,INFO
but it's electronic.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, you put your sample under this thing",,INFO
"and it looks at it in-, and, uh, and determines the,",,INFO
"and it, it's really remarkable.",,INFO
"Uh, the problem they had",,INFO
"and then they wanted some gray to do the, to do the trim.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, but they didn't, didn't occur to them that, um, that they could have taken a sample",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"um, from,",,INFO
"I forgotten, *",,INFO
this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something,,INFO
"but anyway. It's, it's remarkable.",,INFO
"That's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the, you know,",,INFO
"you want this, you want this to look like this",,INFO
and you want that to look like that,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"of course, if it's all white you're all right",,INFO
"but when you start getting into colors,",,INFO
have you had problems getting colors to match?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"As a matter of fact, uh, what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a, uh, a blue",,INFO
"and the blue, even so many years, two years later or so it doesn't match,",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"So,",,CAT
"it's the very same type of paint and everything,",,INFO
Gosh.,,G_G
"So,",,CAT
"So you,",,CAT
"so what's your,",,QUESTION
what's the solution then?,,QUESTION
"Oh, I have no idea.",,CAT
I repainted the whole thing.,,INFO
"Oh, my",,G_G
.,,CAT
"Well, at least you'll get very good at it, right?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"You could go back and, and paint,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
the whole thing over,,INFO
"that's, uh, this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting",,INFO
"because it, uh, it seems like everybody has a, you know, to go in and do,",,INFO
I'll just do a little bit here and a little there .,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Although, the, uh,",,CAT
"it's uh, it,",,CAT
"we almost one day,",,CAT
"we painted the house to, uh,",,INFO
"we painted, we painted the whole inside",,INFO
and it had all this dark trim.,,INFO
"We thought, uh, you know,",,INFO
"we did the one wall but the other trim,",,INFO
"I'm trying to think,",,CAT
"I think, I think we left most of it because it gets to be, uh,",,INFO
they don't do that in the newer houses now,,INFO
"we don't,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"the mold ,",,INFO
.,,CAT
everything is white .,,INFO
In a new house everything is white.,,INFO
"White,",,G_G
yeah.,,CAT
That's what we're trying to get ours to look like.,,INFO
"Oh, good luck",,G_G
We wound up selling the house.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Actually, I, I don't know whether it made,",,INFO
"actually it does,",,INFO
"it's interesting that the white, um, makes the rooms look bigger.",,INFO
"One of the,",,CAT
"in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room, it has molding, uh, like picture frames, I don't know what you call that",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that actually, that are along the walls, you know, up a couple of feet.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And my wife painted those, the insides of those dark blue.",,INFO
"Oh, I see.",,G_G
"And, uh, it makes the room look remarkably smaller.",,INFO
"Huh. She painted the insides dark blue and then the trim,",,QUESTION
"The trim,",,INFO
what color ?,,INFO
is still white.,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"The,",,CAT
White.,,CAT
the molding,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"but by,",,CAT
"and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"but it makes the room look smaller which is, uh",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"uh, which is,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"it explains why they, why they have everything white",,INFO
"but I,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you wouldn't think that I,",,INFO
"well, maybe,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Well, uh, what about the lighting?",,QUESTION
Did it make a big difference?,,QUESTION
"Uh, not particularly",,CAT
because the house has so many windows,,INFO
"Oh, uh-huh.",,CAT
"uh, it has",,CAT
"the, the, the living room has four, uh, good size windows",,INFO
"and, uh, well, of course, at night",,INFO
"but with the,",,CAT
"we have, we have a soccer field",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that's, um, oh, about a hundred yards from our house",,INFO
and the lights shine right at our house.,,INFO
"It's kind of,",,CAT
we didn't know that when we bought the house,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"So that, uh,",,CAT
"you get some,",,CAT
"the color doesn't really matter for, because you have that light.",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"We have a lot of light,",,INFO
yeah.,,CAT
"And, well, it, it, it, um, well, it's just, uh, I think it's just the, the, the dark blue to about three feet",,INFO
and then above that we left it white,,INFO
"so. Anyway, it didn't,",,INFO
I see .,,G_G
it didn't change,,INFO
"but the, the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away",,INFO
"it didn't,",,CAT
"it kind of bled under the masking tape which, I guess, is probably the topic we're",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"we're really on to that, that the masking is,",,INFO
"you have to do that very, very carefully.",,INFO
"And it takes a long time,",,INFO
That's right.,,CAT
You can work yourself to death.,,INFO
"Well, I'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend.",,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
"Really,",,CAT
no kidding.,,CAT
It's kind of frustrating.,,INFO
It is.,,CAT
"A lot of work,",,INFO
a lot of work.,,CAT
"Well, I've got to go to a meeting.",,INFO
It's been good talking to you.,,G_G
Nice talking to you.,,G_G
Okay.,,G_G
Good-bye.,,G_G
Bye,,G_G
,,
"Well, anyway I, uh, I, uh, oh,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
I did forget to ask you.,,INFO
What is your name by the way?,,QUESTION
"Uh, I'm Ann.",,INFO
"Oh, you're Ann.",,CAT
Hi.,,G_G
"But, uh, anyway, I, uh,",,CAT
"lot of, lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good, be a good change if we're going to be talking about the subject t-, tonight which in some I guess criminal courts the",,INFO
Criminal courts?,,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Th-, the one of which was, uh, something, something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town",,INFO
"and that is, uh, and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race. Uh,",,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, they, they, uh, the, the people that",,INFO
"the, uh, the jury that's trying, uh, the officers in that case,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"is, is an all white panel.",,INFO
"And there's been a lot made in the local papers of that,",,INFO
I see.,,CAT
fact.,,INFO
"I can't,",,CAT
I'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one.,,INFO
They have.,,INFO
They have.,,INFO
They moved it up to the county north of here.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"Um, it's in Ventura",,INFO
"and there's, there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously,",,INFO
"and it's kind of, it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that, uh, that,",,INFO
"Well, that videotape was just horrible.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It was everywhere.,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"So you know,",,CAT
"and I, I think it would be very difficult to find someone, uh, find a panel that would be, not have seen it and, and known of what was going on.",,INFO
"Oh, I agree with you",,CAT
"but I can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of, of discrimination or, or, you know, uh, appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff.",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
"You know, um, the you know,",,CAT
"I, I'm kind of torn on this issue.",,INFO
"It's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not, he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways I think true.",,INFO
"But on the other hand, it's, it's also saying that white jurors are not going to, are not going to convict.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Uh, you know, they're not going to do their job. Which is",,INFO
"the whole, the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or, or, or, uh, let go based on whether,",,INFO
Exactly.,,CAT
"or not the person, whether or not the evidence says,",,INFO
Based on fact.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
that there's enough,,INFO
How interesting.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
So what's the prevailing thought within the community?,,QUESTION
"Um,",,CAT
"I mean you know, what the news media is going to make of it,",,INFO
but what about the community?,,QUESTION
"They, well,",,CAT
I guess it depends on who you talk to.,,INFO
"I haven't talked to, uh, I haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it",,INFO
"but I, I rather imagine there's, there's some snickering about it. And a lot of the usually fatalistic, uh, here we go again folks,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
kind of stuff.,,INFO
"Oh, my goodness.",,G_G
That can't be good for Los Angeles either.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
no.,,CAT
"I, you know,",,CAT
"on, on, on one hand you know, on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's sm-, they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing,",,INFO
"Oh, exactly.",,CAT
"these people beating the heck out of this guy. Um,",,INFO
Unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like Los Angeles.,,INFO
You're going to have it just about anywhere.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
There. *,,CAT
"Well,",,CAT
"But that's, that's interesting.",,INFO
Yeah. Um,,CAT
What about the judge who's hearing the case?,,QUESTION
Is he going to be impartial?,,QUESTION
"Is he going to,",,QUESTION
.,,CAT
"be a go-, a good adjudicator?",,INFO
"I don't know. You know,",,CAT
"and, and again there's something else tha-, you know, there was a uh, something else along those lines.",,INFO
There was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins.,,INFO
"I don't know if it's, it's got, it's got as much notoriety",,INFO
"but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was, as it was with, uh, the Rodney King problem.",,INFO
"Um, a girl walked into a Korean owned store",,INFO
"and, uh, they, she had a dispute, black girl.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"She, she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the, with the owner of the store.",,INFO
The owner of the store popped her.,,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, and, oh, of course, they,",,CAT
"you know, the criminal case went up",,INFO
"and, and the judge gave the woman who shot her, shot the girl a, uh, uh, practically a suspended sentence.",,INFO
I mean it was,,CAT
"Oh, my goodness.",,G_G
"it was just,",,INFO
"she gave her no time in jail, you know, all of these things",,INFO
"and then, oh, there's we have these, we have people wondering around to-, with petitions trying to get the judge,",,INFO
To get that judge recalled I would think.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Huh.,,CAT
That's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It would make, it would make life easier.",,INFO
It would.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh,",,CAT
"But,",,CAT
"you would know, the whole world would know what you were facing.",,INFO
"And then it's a matter of, of deciding,",,INFO
,,
All right?,,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
How many kids do you have?,,QUESTION
"I think w-, I think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children.",,INFO
"We,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"have three children who are eleven, nine, and eight.",,INFO
So this is the big issue with us. Although I don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about,,INFO
but,,INFO
.,,CAT
perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Anyway.,,CAT
You don't have children?,,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
But you're married?,,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"we, we've been married for two and a half years.",,INFO
We've been trying for about two years but,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
no luck yet.,,INFO
"Hopefully,",,CAT
"You know, I know we're not supposed to do this long distance",,INFO
but actually I'm getting a call.,,INFO
I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting.,,INFO
Could I ask you to hold one minute?,,COMMAND
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I'll be right back.,,INFO
"Excuse me,",,INFO
"Had-,",,CAT
just a moment.,,INFO
They're going to get mad,,INFO
She had another call.,,CAT
"She has just three kids, eleven, nine, and eight.",,CAT
Hello?,,G_G
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I'm so sorry.,,G_G
All right.,,CAT
That was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow,,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
Brownie meeting.,,INFO
"That keeps you bu-,",,INFO
.,,CAT
do you have a lot of activities with your kids?,,QUESTION
"Well, I don't want to, I don't want this to be a unilateral conversation",,INFO
"but, yes,",,CAT
we do.,,INFO
.,,CAT
Both my husband and I work,,INFO
"and our children are sixth, fourth, and third grade.",,INFO
"And the school years are wonderful,",,INFO
they're just wonderful.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"The kids, they are real people",,INFO
and they are interesting,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"they, they have all their own activities",,INFO
"and, um, I think as parents we really enjoy them in, in our personal situation",,INFO
our children have not yet decided to rebel,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"So they're pretty good kids, huh?",,QUESTION
"I'm su-, sure that's coming though.",,INFO
"But,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
they are wonderful kids.,,INFO
"Well, we had ni-, wh-, growing up",,INFO
I guess I can talk about us.,,CAT
We had nine kids in our family.,,INFO
We had eight boys and one girl.,,INFO
"But, my Dad, uh,",,INFO
You had eight boys and one girl?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"And the time that my, we spent with our Dad was, he owned his own business",,INFO
so we worked with him most of the time.,,INFO
So that's how we spent most of the time with him.,,INFO
Are you Mormons?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
That's what the Utah and the large family.,,INFO
"That was a dead giveaway, huh?",,QUESTION
"Well, we're Catholics.",,INFO
I came from a family of five.,,INFO
"I had four brothers,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
the only girl.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled.,,INFO
"Which that,",,CAT
I never felt spoiled.,,INFO
.,,CAT
In fact I always thought my toys were destroyed,,INFO
"I was going to say, my sister wasn't spoiled very much.",,INFO
No.,,CAT
Usually busy fighting for survival.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's .,,CAT
"But,",,CAT
"Well, I do think with working parents it is, I mean, there are some real issues here. Um,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that I think, um,",,INFO
I don't know.,,CAT
It's an interesting problem.,,INFO
"I happen to, um,",,INFO
I'm a pediatrician.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"My husband is a physician,",,INFO
"so, uh, I, I I talk to parents about this a lot.",,INFO
"But children,",,CAT
"I, I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home, um, need very early to come to grips with any guilt,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And I feel when my children were very young, I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing.",,INFO
And I long ago decided I'm a better mother because I work outside the home.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I really believe that.,,INFO
"And it has, um, helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that I think are wonderful particularly at this age,",,INFO
and I think our kids are real secure.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot,,INFO
so I know it sounds like a rationalization,,INFO
"but it's, I really think it's true for our family,",,INFO
"Wel-,",,CAT
and I think it has worked very well.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"It's like you said, you know, to each his own.",,INFO
And we're planning on having my wife stay home.,,INFO
"And but,",,CAT
"There's no question,",,INFO
I think that's really the best.,,INFO
"If, if a woman is happy doing that,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I hate to put it quite that way.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
I was twenty-nine when I had my first child,,INFO
"and, uh, I would not have been real fulfilled.",,INFO
I really would not have been totally staying home with a young child.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"It's a wonderful, it's wonderful to be a mother",,INFO
"but, uh, I like th-, I like the way I did it.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
I sort of worked half time.,,INFO
I had very flexible hours.,,INFO
I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year,,INFO
"and I,",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I preach all the time to, to mothers.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Um, and I think we choose very, very carefully the, um, alternative situations that we had them in.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Some baby-sitting groups,",,INFO
"again, I know it sounds like a rationalization,",,INFO
but I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children,,INFO
"and they, they learn to share.",,INFO
They learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
I think that helps.,,INFO
"Well, that's good.",,G_G
"Sounds like you're, have a handle on it.",,INFO
"Well, so, so .",,QUESTION
.,,CAT
"So, your wife, does she work right now?",,INFO
"Um, no,",,CAT
not right now.,,INFO
"She's out,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Well, we just moved down here.",,INFO
We used to live up in Seattle for a couple of years.,,INFO
You're still trying to dry out?,,QUESTION
It's that's no problem here.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
we really liked it up there,,INFO
"but then wh-,",,CAT
,,
Okay.,,CAT
"So, uh, then, do you keep kids?",,QUESTION
Is this two year old yours,,QUESTION
or do you keep children for other people?,,QUESTION
No.,,CAT
I have two children.,,INFO
I have a two year old and a three and a half year old.,,INFO
"Oh, that's exactly what I have.",,INFO
Really?,,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
That's wild.,,G_G
I know.,,G_G
.,,CAT
"I,",,CAT
"my, my little girl was three and a half in March",,INFO
and my son was two in January.,,INFO
"Oh, boy.",,G_G
"Well, mine was two in March",,INFO
"and the three and a half year old will be four in, in July.",,INFO
That's pretty close.,,G_G
So that is pretty close,,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
But I'm home with the kids all day,,INFO
"and I have really, uh, tried to make that a priority even though it's financially a big strain on us.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
it is.,,CAT
"But,",,CAT
Have you been able to do that all along,,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Pretty much,",,CAT
pretty much.,,CAT
"Uh, I work part-time",,INFO
"but, uh, my husband's able, you know, mostly to take care of them when I'm working.",,INFO
So.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, we adopted these two little guys",,INFO
"Oh, how neat.",,G_G
"and that was another reason why I really wanted to be here because, you know, they have had a couple foster homes already.",,INFO
How old were they when you adopted?,,QUESTION
The baby was eleven weeks old,,INFO
and his brother was,,INFO
So he probably doesn't remember.,,INFO
"twenty, twenty-two months.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
So.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
definitely needed.,,CAT
"Well, that's, that's pretty interesting.",,G_G
"Well, I have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
you know.,,INFO
"That was always my dream, you know.",,INFO
I wasn't necessarily a career person,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"but as long as I was single and had to work, I was going to get a good job and do the best I could.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And my husband was in the type of business that, you know,",,INFO
it's insurance,,INFO
so you have to build a clientele,,INFO
and by the time we had kids I couldn't quit.,,INFO
"Oh, boy.",,G_G
And so I haven't been able to quit yet.,,INFO
So I've had to deal a lot with child care,,INFO
"and course, we're hoping within, hopefully, the next two years I'll be able to quit and stay home.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, I started out, uh,",,INFO
my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born,,INFO
"Oh, that's neat.",,G_G
until she went to work last year in August,,INFO
and it worked out pretty good.,,INFO
"You know, we had always said from the beginning that if it gets in the way of the friendship then I'll take them somewhere else.",,INFO
"You know, the friendship is more important.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them, you know.",,INFO
She loved them like they were hers,,INFO
and I,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I knew, you know,",,INFO
I had good peace of mind.,,INFO
I knew that they were taken care of,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
"That's the hardest thing I think, you know",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"to, to deal with is that people love your,",,INFO
.,,CAT
kids.,,INFO
"I put, uh, my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and, you know",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
that kind of thing,,INFO
"and, uh, he was in there for three months when I pulled him out",,INFO
"and the, the teacher had eleven kids.",,INFO
"It was excellent, supposedly.",,INFO
The reputation was fantastic for this place.,,INFO
Was supposed to be an excellent school,,INFO
"and I had several friends who had, had recommended it, too.",,INFO
But it really gets down to the particular teacher.,,INFO
Huh.,,CAT
And she was a new teacher at the school,,INFO
"and she had eleven, you know, three year olds in a room",,INFO
and I just think it was way too much.,,INFO
The were almost all boys.,,INFO
But she had no help?,,QUESTION
Pardon?,,CAT
She had no help?,,QUESTION
She was alone with them.,,QUESTION
I didn't think much.,,CAT
I don't think much.,,CAT
"Oh, that is hard.",,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
"And she was just my, uh,",,INFO
three year old is real active.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
And she just kept saying how wild he was.,,INFO
"Well, you know, there was kind of a connotation there of him being, you know, it being a problem.",,INFO
Like he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said.,,INFO
"Well, you know, at three years old",,INFO
Jeez.,,G_G
I don't find that to be a behavioral problem,,INFO
I don't either,,CAT
So.,,CAT
You know,,INFO
"I mean, it's kind of like she was, there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and it's really hard to con-,",,INFO
"you can't control eleven three year olds with one person, you know.",,INFO
You have to let them have some wild time,,INFO
"Yeah, you know.",,CAT
if that's considered wild,,INFO
So I just finally took him out. Plus financial reasons.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
It was expensive.,,INFO
But I was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time.,,INFO
"But I still felt like even after all the checking I did, you know, you really can't know everything",,INFO
.,,CAT
about what's going to happen.,,INFO
"I felt safe that the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them, you know, because",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms.,,INFO
And I,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
felt like that was a big factor for me.,,INFO
That they would would be safe,,INFO
Yes.,,CAT
"you know, from any kind of abuse or that",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
kind of thing.,,INFO
"Well, when, when my friend decided to go back to work, and whenever we had problems, it worked out okay because she would come and tell me",,INFO
and we'd work it out.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"After that, I found another girl that had gone to church with us that, you know, they needed it financially.",,INFO
She had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy,,INFO
"and I though,",,CAT
"well, you know, we'll try her.",,INFO
But she came to our house,,INFO
and that just did not work.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, I mean, she loved the kids",,INFO
and she was good with them.,,INFO
"But, uh, you know, they were filthy when I'd get home.",,INFO
Now I understand kids go out and play,,INFO
and they get dirty,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
but I mean filthy.,,INFO
I'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair,,INFO
and the,,CAT
"Oh, gosh.",,G_G
"and I was, like, gosh.",,INFO
"And then, you know, my own furniture and stuff was like, you know,",,INFO
"the kitchen table, the, I'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs",,INFO
"and the,",,CAT
You had to come home and clean before you could,,INFO
"and clean,",,INFO
"and I was like,",,INFO
even do anything probably.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And then, in the end, uh, she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me",,INFO
"so I was, I had a pretty bad taste in my mouth.",,INFO
"She told me about five thirty one afternoon, it was a Friday, that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning.",,INFO
Oh gosh.,,G_G
"Well, you know, I work eight to five thirty",,INFO
so what am I supposed to do,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"So I, well, I had been sick",,INFO
"and I,",,CAT
it ended up that I didn't go to work Monday because I was sick.,,INFO
So I stayed home with them,,INFO
and we went to some of the Kindercares.,,INFO
"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"I was, I took the kids there once just to try it.",,INFO
They had a free day at Kindercare.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, that's what they said.",,INFO
There were two pretty near our house,,INFO
"and they said, well, bring them in this week for a free day",,INFO
so I lined up someone Tuesday.,,INFO
"They had a Mother's Day Out that my baby-sitter took them to, you know, which was fine.",,INFO
They liked it.,,INFO
They had been going to it for years.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And so I stayed with them Monday.,,INFO
Tuesday they went to that.,,INFO
Wednesday I took them to one Kindercare.,,INFO
Thursday I took them to another Kindercare,,INFO
.,,CAT
.,,CAT
and then Friday my husband and I split.,,INFO
But on Thursday I didn't like the Kindercares.,,INFO
I didn't either.,,CAT
I had,,INFO
"They,",,CAT
"one bad, I had two bad experiences just that one day with medicine that my son was supposed to have for a cold that they never gave him.",,INFO
They didn't give him.,,CAT
"And the other one was that the, the younger one got bit",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
really badly by another child,,INFO
and what they did was they took my younger one out and put him in a crib and left him in a crib the rest of the day.,,INFO
"Oh, that's horrible.",,G_G
Instead of taking the kid that was biting out and do something with him.,,CAT
And doing something with him.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Well, not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month, which I didn't have",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know. I didn't, I, you know,",,INFO
"we're, we're a Christian family",,INFO
"and, you know, they, because they're, you know, like public, they're not private",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"you know. They can't pray,",,INFO
they can't talk about God.,,INFO
They can't do anything like that,,INFO
and I don't want them indoctrinated,,INFO
"So you feel like your values aren't getting,",,INFO
"yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"you know,",,INFO
"but I'd like them to be able to say, gee, God made the flowers, you know, and",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
things like that.,,INFO
God loves you.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"You know, basic things like that.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
basic.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, uh, I talked to another lady at church.",,INFO
It was like Thursday of that week,,INFO
"and she said oh, I found the most wonderful place that I've been taking my daughter",,INFO
"and I've know this girl,",,INFO
I went to college with her,,INFO
"so I really, I, you, I, I value her opinion.",,INFO
And she told me about a private one.,,INFO
"It, it was associated with one of the churches here.",,INFO
It's not the church I go to,,INFO
"but it's, you know, it, it was Lubbock View Christian Church",,INFO
and it's a private academy.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And so I went over there,,INFO
and I talked to the lady.,,INFO
"Well, they have like a three year waiting list.",,INFO
"But she said, I had a mother tell me that she may take a job in San Antonio",,INFO
"and she has a three year old and a toddler, which mine was at the time.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And she said I should know something by tomorrow, which was Friday,",,INFO
"and she said if she leaves, she said, I'll let you have her spot.",,INFO
Wow.,,G_G
"And so Friday afternoon at five thirty, she called me",,INFO
and she said she's going.,,INFO
You can bring your kids Monday,,INFO
"Oh, what luck.",,G_G
I know.,,G_G
"I was just like, God set this,",,INFO
.,,CAT
up for me.,,INFO
Really,,CAT
He knew I needed this,,INFO
"and, uh, so since October then, they have been going there",,INFO
"and i-,",,CAT
I love it.,,INFO
I have been at,,INFO
"Oh, that's great.",,G_G
such peace with myself.,,INFO
It's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we don't have the little day to day hassles,,INFO
and,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
the cost was not near as much as the Kindercares were going to be.,,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
Wow.,,G_G
Did you hear my printer in the background.,,QUESTION
I'm sorry.,,G_G
"I hope you can understand what I s-,",,INFO
That's okay,,CAT
I got the dryer going,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
in the background,,INFO
so,,CAT
I was only about twenty dollars more a month than I was paying because being a private institution they're nonprofit.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So, they don't have to charge as much.",,INFO
"Oh, that's great.",,G_G
And the hours are wonderful,,INFO
"and I just, I think it's the best thing.",,INFO
"I told Russ yest-, that we should have done this a long time ago",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
you know,,INFO
It's great.,,G_G
"So I guess as long as I have to work, I feel good that they're there.",,INFO
"they're getting the love, the care.",,INFO
They have a little curriculum.,,INFO
"They teach them, you know, the alphabet, the numbers, the things which, you know, if they learn, they learn.",,INFO
"If they don't, they don't.",,INFO
I don't feel like I have to indoctrinate them by age three,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
but it's kind of neat when they,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"come home with it, you know.",,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
They think it's fun.,,INFO
"It's not a big, you know",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
trauma to them to learn something.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, and the teachers.",,INFO
"Well, Taylor got bit several times",,INFO
and Taylor bit several times,,INFO
and the teachers dealt with that.,,INFO
"We're like, hey they're two",,INFO
and we keep them apart,,INFO
and we scold them,,INFO
and we correct them,,INFO
"and, you know, they mark it all down",,INFO
and they let you know,,INFO
"and, and, you know, they get over it real quick",,INFO
and he doesn't do it anymore,,INFO
and,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"they work at the potty train-,",,INFO
"I just, just",,CAT
"so mu,",,CAT
I don't know.,,CAT
I just feel like a big burden was lifted,,INFO
Really.,,CAT
Because sometimes it is a burden having them all day because I can't,,INFO
It is.,,CAT
do anything with them here.,,INFO
I can't even go grocery shopping right now,,INFO
I know.,,G_G
with the two of them because the baby is so into everything,,INFO
"and the older brother is you know, running around all over the place",,INFO
so,,INFO
I know,,CAT
"it is, it's hard.",,INFO
and that's hard.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
So.,,CAT
"Well, and it, it, you know,",,CAT
"but I understa-,",,CAT
"I, I, I wish you could find a good Mother's Day Out because that would be good for your",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I need to.,,INFO
peace of mind also.,,INFO
"Even for just a couple days a, mornings a week or something",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"to have something like that,",,INFO
"so I, I think I'm going to look for that.",,INFO
Remind me of that now that you mention it,,INFO
.,,CAT
"I was, been meaning to do that, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Because some of the churches do have them, uh, you know, for like six dollars per child",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"and that's not that big a deal, you know.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
For a couple times,,INFO
"And that's usually like, you know,",,INFO
"I don't know when mine were going to Mother's Day Out,",,INFO
it was like from nine to three,,INFO
so that was a pretty good,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"pretty good time, you know.",,INFO
My baby-sitter would take them and then pick them up.,,INFO
Yeah,,CAT
.,,CAT
"So, that worked out real good.",,CAT
That's sounds good.,,G_G
"Well, I'm tickled to death.",,INFO
I hope you find something,,INFO
and,,G_G
"Well, thanks.",,G_G
it was good talking to you.,,INFO
Did we cover everything we need to?,,G_G
"Well, I guess.",,G_G
Okay.,,G_G
It said child care criteria,,G_G
Okay.,,G_G
and I think we both listed an experience,,G_G
Yeah.,,G_G
Okay.,,G_G
"Well, great.",,G_G
"Well, thanks a lot.",,G_G
You have a good day.,,G_G
And you too.,,G_G
Bye-bye,,G_G
Bye,,G_G
,,
"Okay,",,CAT
"Mike, I guess we'll be talking about painting recently.",,INFO
"Any kind of recent painting you've done, uh, yourself?",,QUESTION
Have you done any recently?,,QUESTION
"Well, we, uh, remodeled a bathroom.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, which required, uh, completely repainting the bathroom,",,INFO
"and the other project we've done around here is, uh, we've remodeled all our, all our closets",,INFO
"Wow,",,G_G
"wow,",,G_G
"that's, that's quite a chore.",,INFO
which required quite a bit of painting.,,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
I imagine it did.,,INFO
Did you have that done professionally,,QUESTION
or did you do that yourself?,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
"we did it ourselves,",,INFO
did it myself.,,INFO
Did you enjoy that?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"Oh, that's, that's fun.",,G_G
"We just recently, uh, had our boys' room,",,INFO
"our two oldest boys share a room,",,INFO
"and they're, uh, the paint has, uh, kind of faded and deteriorated,",,INFO
"and so we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth,",,INFO
"and, uh, looks quite good.",,INFO
We were quite pleased with the result.,,INFO
Is this a project you did yourself?,,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
"it's a project, uh, that I did,",,INFO
"yes,",,CAT
"and, and, uh.",,CAT
"What, what brought about the fading of the paint?",,QUESTION
Well,,CAT
Just sun exposure?,,QUESTION
"I don't think it's sun exposure,",,CAT
"but, uh, boys will be boys,",,INFO
"and there, there were crayon marks on there",,INFO
and,,INFO
"Oh, okay,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
"we had to, to scrub the crayon marks off, of course, try and get it clean.",,INFO
Latex paint?,,QUESTION
Pardon me?,,CAT
Latex?,,QUESTION
Yes,,CAT
it was.,,INFO
"It was latex paint,",,INFO
"and that's, uh, what we put back on there, was a latex paint.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Plus, uh, they had bunk beds,",,INFO
"and the boy, one of the younger boys, when he was younger, about three years old, got a, uh, got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures",,INFO
On the ceiling?,,QUESTION
"Yes,",,CAT
on the ceiling.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"And, uh, you scrub and you scrub,",,INFO
but you can't it all off.,,INFO
"No,",,CAT
that's true.,,CAT
"And so, that's one of the reasons why we painted,",,INFO
"and, uh.",,CAT
"Did you go, what kind of paint did you use on the ceiling?",,QUESTION
"We used a flat, latex paint",,INFO
Okay.,,CAT
"and in the bedroom, as I understand, that's, uh, one of the better type of paints to have",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"because it's not so reflective and, and glassy colored,",,INFO
"and it, uh, turned out real, real well.",,INFO
"Seems like, uh, I've, we've done some remodeling of some, uh, rental houses that we have",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it appears as though that, uh, oh, in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built, uh, they used a lot of, uh, semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints,",,INFO
.,,CAT
it seemed like.,,INFO
"We had an occasion, uh, where we had to do some sealing",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"of, uh, the se-, of the, this type of paint before we could paint it.",,INFO
"Oh, you had to prime it and",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and se-, cover over it.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
Huh.,,CAT
You had pretty good luck with one coat type paint?,,QUESTION
You use a particular brand or anything?,,QUESTION
"Well, I like to use this, this Sears, uh, the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee.",,INFO
Weather beater type stuff?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"And the reason being is once I painted, I don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later",,INFO
Understand.,,G_G
"but, uh,",,CAT
"and, uh, we're quite satisfied with that",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, and occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale,",,INFO
"and we do, do that.",,INFO
"In fact, I was just reading an article,",,INFO
you mentioned painting your bathroom.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I read an article recently that, uh, you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to, to peel or come off because of the moisture, high moisture content in your bath, bathroom.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"it's a lot like, uh, wall paper.",,INFO
That's true.,,CAT
"And, uh, did you have any problems with that",,QUESTION
"or,",,CAT
"Well, the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath,",,INFO
so we didn't have a problem with that.,,INFO
"Oh, good.",,G_G
"Uh, I have had, I've, uh, have never experienced that type of a problem",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, with a latex paint.",,INFO
"Oh, good.",,G_G
"Nei-, neither have I",,INFO
"So, you shouldn't have a, you shouldn't have a problem with it.",,INFO
"Oh, good.",,G_G
"They're, they're pretty well refined today",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"a lot of the paints,",,INFO
and Sears is one of the better ones.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I've used, uh, many a gallon of them, myself.",,INFO
"Do you, uh, have you ever used an oil base paint?",,QUESTION
"Uh, used oil base paints for trim",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"you know, like around doors and, and on doors, things like that.",,INFO
"Wh-, why do you use that?",,QUESTION
"I'm, I'm kind of learning at this, new at this,",,INFO
but.,,QUESTION
"Uh, primarily because it, it seems to be a little more, uh, well, let's say",,INFO
"It adheres better, or lasts longer?",,INFO
"well, not so much that.",,CAT
It seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"as opposed to, uh, a latex type paint.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, it just, you know, it, it gives you a, a variance even though it's the same color.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"Well, that's good,",,G_G
that's good.,,G_G
So it's worked out pretty well for us.,,INFO
"Uh, have you ever done any painting outside?",,QUESTION
"Uh, quite a bit,",,CAT
painted a couple of houses.,,INFO
"Uh, recently this summer we painted a, uh, out building, which is a shed that we have on the,",,INFO
.,,CAT
,,
Set.,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
"You, you got the topic, right?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
Okay.,,CAT
"Uh, well, where in Dallas are you?",,QUESTION
I'm in Richardson.,,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"So you do re-, do recycling there?",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"Richardson has, uh, well, they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly, if it's not raining.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And they also have a couple of areas where you can take, uh, cans, plastic and paper, to, uh, you know, dump them off there if you don't, uh, want to wait and have a pick up, least of paper,",,INFO
but they don't pick up the other items.,,INFO
They don't pick up cans or the,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
plastic.,,INFO
"Are they going to later,",,QUESTION
do you know?,,QUESTION
I'm not sure.,,CAT
"They only started to do the newspaper uh, late last year.",,INFO
Just kind of like a trial basis.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And see how it goes, so I don't know if they're going to pick up the other things.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
What about you?,,QUESTION
"Well, I'm, I'm in Dallas proper",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
in the city of Dallas,,INFO
"and I know they do have, you know, a pilot program going on",,INFO
but it's not here.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
So they're not picking up anything,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"So, I mean, we, we collect everything",,INFO
"We've got all these boxes in our garage for, you know, green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything.",,INFO
Where do you take them?,,QUESTION
"Well, there's, there's a couple places.",,INFO
"Unfortunately, we can't find a place that will take everything.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"Uh, there's a lot of places to take, like the plastic, uh, shopping bags",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
like most of the grocery stores.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
And there's a Wal-Mart nearby that takes almost everything.,,INFO
I can't remember what it is they don't take.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
And the library will take glass.,,INFO
"So we end up, you know,",,INFO
on the weekend we pack it all in the car,,INFO
"and,",,INFO
.,,CAT
"and as we go places we, oh, wait, we can drop the glass off you know.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"Drop things off one at a time,",,INFO
"but, uh, and it's kind of disappointing, I mean,",,INFO
"I would even be happy if they just had one, you know, one place where you could do everything.",,INFO
"You know, it would still be more convenient than what we have now.",,INFO
"One of the people from my department, I think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the Dallas Shelter.",,INFO
Um.,,CAT
I think it was,,INFO
Where is that?,,QUESTION
closer to downtown.,,INFO
"Uh, she's not here anymore",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"but, uh, yeah,",,CAT
I'm pretty far north.,,INFO
"I'm not, I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm north of Addison actually.",,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
"So I'm, I'm really",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"I'm, s-, I'm in Dallas, but only technically",,INFO
"Well, sometimes we take our, uh, we always keep our aluminum cans.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
And a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I've seen those.,,INFO
You don't get too much money back.,,INFO
I figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But normally I collect, oh, like three trash bags full",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
and I take them over to that can bank,,INFO
and it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans,,INFO
.,,CAT
in the can bank.,,INFO
Don't get too much money for them,,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Well, you get something",,INFO
.,,CAT
"Uh,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"We used to do that,",,INFO
"but, again, that's another stop",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and it doesn't take plastic bags and, and all that sort of thing,",,INFO
"but, uh, I think that, you know, I heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is",,INFO
and,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
so hopefully they'll do it soon.,,INFO
That would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and, where I grew up we only had one a week",,INFO
and that was certainly sufficient.,,INFO
"So if they just do,",,INFO
one of them will be trash,,INFO
"and the alternate time would be recyclables,",,INFO
that would be great.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"So,",,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, I'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers, you know.",,INFO
I seem to put them out there,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
on Wednesday,,INFO
"and like sometimes they come by,",,INFO
sometimes they don't.,,INFO
Oh.,,CAT
I'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that.,,INFO
Um.,,CAT
"But I could certainly have, uh, three bins out there for, you know, plastic and",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"and tin and paper, whatever they were going to, uh, separate into and, and have them pick it up on, on one of the two days per week.",,INFO
That would be easy.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Do you have to, uh, sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that, that sort of thing",,QUESTION
or do they take the whole thing?,,QUESTION
"You're not supposed to have, like the coupons in there.",,INFO
"Oh, okay.",,CAT
"Uh, or you're not supposed to put magazines in there",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and you can't take newspapers.,,INFO
"Now at work, uh, you know, we have changed our recycling.",,INFO
At first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle.,,INFO
"And not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears, you can throw it in there because at first",,INFO
Let me guess,,INFO
"they said,",,INFO
"you work at T I,",,INFO
right?,,QUESTION

"Wh-, why do you think that it's less close than it used to be?",,QUESTION
"Well, I, I just think that, uh, you know, at that ti-,",,CAT
"when, when they were a-,",,CAT

in one small community.,,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
Which is a shame,,INFO

social lives and so forth.,,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"It's more of a, you know, a smaller, smaller unit,",,INFO
"and you know, we, we tend to try to do things, I think with our immediate family,",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"as opposed to the extended family. Of people that we may or may not remember or know, you know, very well.",,INFO
Uh,,CAT

Do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group?,,QUESTION
"Uh,",,CAT
"On a regular basis, not just Christmas cards.",,INFO

"my mother's sisters,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT

Right.,,CAT

"Uh, you know, and, and generally when I was growing up a lot of those people, the only time I ever saw them was at the reunion,",,INFO
"so, uh",,CAT
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
you do not really feel that that really close to them.,,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"In my, my, uh, father's family, we get together every year at a different location, either Dallas or Oklahoma City.",,INFO
"They had chosen Santa Barbara, California for this summer and, and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"because most of us live either in the midwest, or like in the Texas, Oklahoma area.",,INFO
"And, uh, so they cancelled that one and, uh, are looking next year bringing it back closer,",,INFO
"but we have a letter, a family letter,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"that circulates,",,INFO
and it usually goes through me twice a year,,INFO
"and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the, your new letter on the top,",,INFO
and then that's the way it's kept in order.,,INFO
"And then, about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion, you do not feel like, I do not know anything about this person.",,INFO
"You have,",,INFO
That's a good idea.,,G_G
read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth.,,INFO
"So, you are kind of,",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
half way acquainted that way.,,INFO
"And that,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"that's been a, that's been a nice way of keeping us all aware of each other, I think.",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
We tried to start that in my husband's family.,,INFO
"His mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago,",,INFO
"and I said, well let's start this letter,",,INFO
and it just never,,INFO
my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us,,INFO
and that's as far as it got.,,INFO
"I sent it,",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"on to the next one,",,INFO
"and, and, but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one, in Scottsdale, Arizona,",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
for that family.,,INFO
"We are real glad we got together because since that, that time there were only like two of the, one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left.",,INFO
And the sister-in-law died,,INFO

Sure.,,CAT
Which is nice.,,INFO
Uh,,INFO
You bet.,,G_G
"Uh, uh, although I do, uh, a lot of,",,INFO
I am a speech pathology major,,INFO
and so I do a lot of clinical work,,INFO
"and when I do clinic work then I have to, uh, uh, look my best.",,INFO
Look professional,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
.,,CAT
Unfortunately.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I understand.,,G_G
"I am a,",,INFO
I own my company.,,INFO
"I am in the, I am, uh, manufactures rep sales organization",,INFO
and my office is a small office,,INFO
and I am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
but then when I travel it is a little different situation.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
sure.,,CAT
"Uh, suits and sports coat, tie and the whole bit.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
Cause you go to meetings and you are required to look your best and look professional of course.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, uh, do you find that, uh, on the average do people give uh, more credibility or less credibility to a professional, uh, to professionally dressed individual.",,QUESTION
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I think in today's society, uh, there is more credibility to be quite honest",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I will always remember,",,INFO
"I will tell this real quick story when I graduated from college,",,INFO
"my first job years ago, uh, thirty years ago, twenty-nine years ago, in fact, was selling agricultural fertilizer.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I worked for the, uh, Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical",,INFO
"and I sold uh, you know, manure.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And, uh, I would go out and call on farmers",,INFO
"and I would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that,",,INFO
but I was calling on guys that wore bib overalls.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"And so, one day I got up and thought well I will just go casual and you know that I called on a guy wearing exactly that, bib overalls,",,INFO
and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and he sort of expected me to dress as a professional,,INFO
"Oh, really?",,QUESTION
"so, uh, it was sort of,",,INFO
Even the farmers.,,QUESTION
You bet,,CAT
"Oh, wow.",,CAT
even back then,,INFO
"so I sort, uh, been aware of my dress ever since then and",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"try to look my best,",,INFO
but here again I dress casual quite a bit,,INFO
"so,",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
certainly.,,G_G
It gives you confidence.,,INFO
"In my business if I call on the the J C Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago, then I wear coat and tie.",,INFO
"If I call on just, uh, a normal little dealer of mine, I might be casual.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I call on Oshman's sporting goods, again, it may be casual or it may be coat and tie.",,INFO
So it depends.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
it depends.,,CAT
Sure.,,CAT
"Uh, so you don't, uh,",,CAT
if you had the choice would you wear a tie or not?,,QUESTION
"Uh, probably no.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Probably, no.",,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Because, uh, today I believe you can get away with,",,CAT
but then it depends on who you are calling on.,,INFO
"Who you're,",,CAT
"you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie, you just, uh, he would be missing something.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Although, he shouldn't be evaluated on that.",,INFO
"Right,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"So, it's its' just different.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"that, uh,",,CAT
"if if you wanted to, uh, uh, really get into a hot issue, uh",,COMMAND
"well at least in some in some beliefs, uh, how people dress when they go to church is, uh, is uh, sometimes a pretty, pretty hot topic.",,INFO
"Yes,",,CAT
it is.,,INFO
"Uh, un-, un-, un-, unfortunately.",,INFO
"I am, uh, like a Catholic",,INFO
"and the people that go to my Church, you know",,INFO
Catholics dress very casual,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
a lot of the times.,,INFO
"People in jeans and in whatever,",,INFO
"but yet the way I was raised,",,INFO
"I am a converted Catholic,",,INFO
"the way I was raised,",,INFO
I was raised a Baptist,,INFO
and like as a youngster I use to always dress up all the time.,,INFO
I guess that has changed also.,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"Uh, yeah.",,CAT
"I'm, I am, uh, I go to the Church of Christ.",,INFO
I have been raised in the Church of Christ,,INFO
"and, uh, but, uh, I, uh, too many times you hear you hear a lot about what what you're, uh, supposed you're supposed to look your Sunday best",,INFO
Right.,,CAT
"uh, uh, and dress and proper attire",,INFO
"and, uh, and sometimes that really disappoints me, uh, in, uh, when I see in other economic areas like in Kentucky.",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"You know, people just don't have that",,INFO
and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because,,INFO
But .,,CAT
they don't have the clothes to wear.,,INFO
That is a very good point.,,G_G
I am from West Virginia,,INFO
so I understand what you are saying there,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
and it's it's a very good point.,,G_G
Yeah.,,CAT
"But you shouldn't, what's the old saying, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.",,INFO
Certainly.,,G_G
"And, uh, evaluation of an individual. Course, all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have.",,INFO
I think you have to dress sort of accordingly.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But, uh, you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and, uh, or evaluate a person by that.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
What about season to season.,,QUESTION
"Does,",,CAT
I guess your dress changes.,,QUESTION
"Uh, yeah",,CAT
a little bit.,,INFO
"Uh, uh of course in the summer if I can get away with it, I wear, uh, uh, a pair of shorts",,INFO
and that's it.,,INFO
"Run around barefoot,",,INFO
.,,CAT
no shirt or anything,,INFO
"But, uh,",,CAT
,,
"Do you think that there's any way that, uh,",,QUESTION
or do you think there's too much crime now?,,QUESTION
"I mean, I guess,",,INFO
.,,CAT
any crime is too much,,INFO
"but,",,INFO
"Uh, yeah,",,CAT
yeah.,,CAT
It's out of control.,,INFO
"Uh, well, uh, out of control, I don't know.",,CAT
I guess it could be worse.,,INFO
"Uh, we've, uh, we've, we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood.",,INFO

Really?,,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
"I would not of, okay, I would not have guessed that in Seattle.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"you figured it was like Omaha, right?",,QUESTION
Yeah.,,CAT
.,,CAT
You know.,,CAT
"No,",,CAT
"it's, uh, it's not Newark,",,INFO
"but, uh, yeah",,INFO
it's got problems.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I wonder, I mean, I wonder what, what really is the answer.",,INFO
"I mean, it seems like our, our, the prison systems, we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
I think most people regard it as a warehouse.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Where you put away the people that are so bad that, uh, you don't want them out in circulation.",,INFO
"But, but the problem is, is that we, we only have but so much room",,INFO
"and we, we try to put aside in the warehouse,",,INFO
and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
commit crimes,,INFO
"and,",,CAT
That's what I hear.,,CAT
"So it's, uh,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"I, I think, you know,",,CAT
don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea?,,QUESTION
I get the feeling that a lot of people have.,,CAT
I'm not convinced that I have.,,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"Uh, see, I mean, my mom taught English as a second language",,INFO
"and, and she was dealing mostly with people that were, were in on drug crimes",,INFO
"and, uh,",,CAT
"Oh, you mean she taught in a prison?",,QUESTION
Yes.,,CAT
Oh.,,CAT
In a,,INFO
I see.,,CAT
in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia.,,INFO
uh.,,CAT
"And, the problem she had was not with the inmates at all.",,INFO

.,,CAT
"I mean,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
"the b-, the bureaucracy.",,INFO

"but, uh",,INFO
.,,CAT
"they, they put her at the end of a hallway,",,INFO
there were no other classes going on at the time,,INFO
"and they refused to let her wear a body al-, a body alarm.",,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"Which,",,INFO
and,,CAT
"I don't know exactly what that is,",,INFO
"but I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and, and really annoy a lot of people.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, uh, you know ,",,CAT
So she didn't feel safe.,,QUESTION
"No,",,CAT
she didn't.,,INFO
"She didn't,",,INFO
"she, she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates,",,INFO
"and then later on the, uh, the administration kept getting worse,",,INFO
"and, uh, she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't, she didn't feel quite as comfortable around.",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, well, she had decided that it was, when we came back to the States, she decided that it was too,",,INFO
"she didn't feel that public schools were s-, were safe,",,INFO
so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"But, uh,",,CAT
"Well, at least it's maximum security, right",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"But, but the point that was, that it, you know,",,INFO
"you said that perhaps, uh, people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible",,INFO
"and, and I'm, I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in, that run the system have given up on it.",,INFO
"Uh, well, I, I think the people that run, yeah, that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical, you know.",,INFO
Uh.,,CAT
"I mean, I, uh, you know, I, I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff",,INFO
"and it's, uh,",,CAT
"you can get pretty hardened, I'm sure.",,INFO
"But getting, I mean, well, see,",,CAT
"I always have problems because, because I can never decide whether or not I'm, I'm supposed to be a conservative or, or a liberal",,INFO
"but,",,CAT
"Yeah,",,CAT
right.,,CAT
"But I keep,",,INFO
"Those are funny labels, see .",,INFO

"Oh, yeah.",,CAT
"with like little or no money, wouldn't",,INFO
"Oh,",,CAT
wouldn't I be in prison at this point?,,INFO
"Oh, yeah,",,INFO
absolutely.,,CAT
"I think, uh, yeah, I think you can blame it on social problems.",,INFO
Sure.,,CAT
"I mean, I don't know.",,CAT
"I mean, as, as, you know, as poverty has gotten worse, as, you know, education has gotten worse, as there's been more single parent families, as there's been more homelessness, there's m-, been more crime.",,INFO

Yeah.,,CAT
"Um,",,CAT
"Well, um, um, well, I think the education, like our education has, um, increased dramatically,",,INFO

I agree there.,,CAT
"like I, I think, well, um, in the morals and values of like my generation for the most, for most people are totally different from the morals and valleys, um, values of like per se your generation.",,INFO

and then I think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things.,,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
"um, I could agree with that, because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age,",,INFO
"Uh-huh,",,CAT
"yeah,",,CAT
"because I think we're given more now, whereas you had to work for everything,",,INFO

"she'll, she makes us go outside,",,INFO

I see.,,CAT

They just,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"stay in their current job,",,INFO
you know what I mean?,,QUESTION

"I think by putting term limitations on you could, you could slow down some of the problems.",,INFO

Uh-huh.,,CAT
"and they work less, you know, less than I do.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
.,,CAT
"Uh, the only prob-, the only problem I see with term limitations, uh, is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in, with most governments is just so complex that there's a very lar-, you know, there, there is a learning curve and that, you know, you d-, can't just send someone off to Washington and expect, you know, his first day to be an effective, uh, Congress person.",,INFO
"Uh, I think, I think there really is a, there's a lot they need to learn, you know, when you get there.",,INFO
"I think, I think that's true,",,CAT
"however, I think that's always been true.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean, that's true of the Presidency, too,",,INFO
and we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover ever eight years or four years.,,INFO
"And, uh,",,CAT
Yeah,,CAT
"but,",,CAT
"They,",,CAT
"I mean, there is a lot to learn,",,INFO
but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up.,,INFO
I think two years is too short.,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I think it would have to be extended, uh, you know,",,INFO
a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms,,INFO
"or you would increase the length of the, of each term of a Congressman.",,INFO
"Uh, but maybe standardizing on, on a, a four year term for Congress",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Senate and the, the Presidency and then, uh, staggering them so that you don't,",,INFO
we aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years.,,INFO
"Uh, the other, the other thing that, uh, bothers me about our system is just that, uh, in, for, for, in, in, in Congress the amount of power any, any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there",,INFO
"so it's, you know, for, you know, uh,",,CAT
"so unless you have actual, you know, across the board s-, uh, limitations, the, uh, you know, the idea of,",,INFO
"well, we're going to just, we're,",,INFO
"I'm, I'm just going to, you know, vote, vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work,",,INFO
"you know, it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I think, I think that that's true,",,CAT
"but then you have, you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, the C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency.",,INFO
"I mean, the action isn't in West Virginia.",,INFO

but,,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"it really doesn't e-, ar-,",,INFO
the world does not revolve around West Virginia,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"uh, as far as this country is concerned,",,INFO
"the world does revolve around D C, you know",,INFO
Uh-huh,,CAT
"as far as the politics in this country are concerned, the national politics",,INFO
"and the C I A is a, a very large, very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia,",,INFO
"yeah, you know,",,CAT
"it might only be two hour drive from here, but that's a two hour drive",,INFO
Yeah.,,CAT
"and, uh, you know, it, it's a, I think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
or is it the F B I.,,CAT
"I don't remember,",,INFO
"but I think there's,",,CAT
"Well, I mean, l-,",,CAT
"t-,",,CAT
"I don't see why it makes a big difference the C I A because, you know, officially they don't do, they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative.",,INFO
"Yeah,",,CAT
that's officially.,,CAT
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"I mean, we all know that that's not necessarily true.",,INFO
"But I, I think that there are, there are advantages to having seniority and, uh, turn-, or, not having a complete turnover every, some small number of years.",,INFO
"I think there are, I mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"But I think that, uh, all, with all the perks that we've given them,",,INFO
"I mean, I heard on the radio back a, a few weeks ago, uh, during the incidents where they were, you know, like they aren't paying their, their restaurant bills",,INFO

"Uh, I personally had a little experience the other day.",,INFO
"Uh, somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck.",,INFO
"Oh, really.",,CAT
"But, actually, you know, when you look at, at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live, it's really quite a bit better.",,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"Uh, because I came from Florida",,INFO

down there.,,INFO
"Uh, because they were just,",,CAT
it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because,,INFO
Uh-huh.,,CAT
"everybody went to work, you know,",,INFO

um ,,CAT
yes you could send the engine  from  Avon  to Corning it'll take it four hours to get there,,INFO
uh  a- the engine at Elmira  take two boxcars to Corning ,,INFO
um  so four hours later  picks up the two tankers and goes to Elmira ,,INFO
four hours later  so it takes  six hours to get the oranges to Elmira  and the tankers  and all three engines ,,INFO
okay,,CAT
so that would be  six a.m. ,,INFO
alright  and now how what time  will it be  ,,QUESTION
 okay so  then it'll take  then it'll take  three hours so it'll be nine a.m. ,,INFO
can I get from Elmira to Avon in four hours ,,QUESTION
no,,CAT
okay,,CAT
then  what I wanna do  is have  engine E two and E three  and the two boxcars  go from Elmira to Corning ,,INFO
okay,,CAT
I'd like to then  return from Corning to  Elmira  with both engines  two boxcars of oranges  and two tankers ,,INFO
 okay it takes an hour to load so that's  five hours ,,CAT
and I'm back in Elmira with my  boxcars and my tankers ,,INFO
right,,CAT
so in three hours I can have  orange juice ,,INFO
right so  that's  ,,CAT
lo- all  loaded up and ready to go,,INFO
that's right ,,CAT
so it's eight o'clock in Elmira ,,INFO
right,,CAT
can I get from Elmira to Avon in five hours ,,QUESTION
no,,CAT
can you think of a better way to do this ,,QUESTION
 no that looks about as quick as you can get ,,CAT
 quickest-  ,,CAT
can you   conceive of any way to get  to accomplish this task by one p.m.,,QUESTION
no it seems like the close-  uh  earliest you can get it done is two p.m. ,,CAT
uh  with uh out any exception ,,CAT
I don't see any other way to do it  uh  the closest oranges  are  Corning ,,INFO
okay,,CAT
so we necessarily we have to go from Elmira to Avon  th-  we have to go take the orange juice from Elmira to Avon ,,INFO
uh-huh ,,CAT
and that's  gonna take us five hours no matter what ,,INFO
that's right ,,CAT
and we have to spend three hours in  Elmira  ,,INFO
 well that's  actually go- that's gonna take six hours no matter  what  ,,INFO
six  hours no matter what,,INFO
right,,CAT
and we have to spend three hours in Elmira before that  unloading and loading right ,,INFO
right,,CAT
so  from getting to Elmira  with  the oranges  to Avon  takes nine hours at the minimum ,,INFO
right,,CAT
so in order to accomplish this task  we need  to get the oranges to Elmira in four hours ,,INFO
mm-hm ,,CAT
to get a-  to get any engine  to get anything  on any engine to Corning  to Elmira  takes at least four hours ,,INFO
that's right ,,CAT
so that wou-  that  takes our  thirteen hours right there ,,INFO
 right  ,,CAT
 and we haven't  accounted for loading up the oranges ,,INFO
that's right ,,CAT
so it doesn't seem as though there's a way to complete this task  do you agree ,,INFO
uh no it doesn't ,,CAT
okay I'm f- now finished ,,INFO
,,
hello can I help you ,,G_G
uh yes I need to my problem is uh engine E one ,,INFO
yep ,,CAT

okay ,,CAT
and then continue runs back and forth between Avon and Dansville until nine a.m. ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
carrying three boxcars of bananas to Dansville o(n)- on every trip ,,INFO
three boxcars of bananas from where to where ,,QUESTION
from Dansville ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
to Dansville sorry ,,INFO
okay to Dansville okay ,,CAT
to Dansville from Avon ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
um your task is to transport two boxcars of oranges to Avon by nine a.m. it is now twelve midnight ,,COMMAND
okay so we have one engine going back and forth between Avon and Dansville right ,,INFO
right ,,CAT
bringing bananas there ,,INFO
right ,,CAT
okay so and that's engine E one ,,INFO
mm-hm ,,CAT
okay so we need to we need to do do what again get something else to Avon ,,INFO
we need to transport two boxcars of oranges ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
to Avon ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
by nine a.m. ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
it's now twelve midnight ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
okay ,,CAT
okay so ,,CAT
alright so we just need to get um let's see we need to get um to Dansville two boxcars of oranges ,,INFO
right ,,CAT
why to Dansville I thought we had to go to Avon ,,QUESTION
well i- cause it uh the engine goes from uh runs back and forth between Avon and Dansville ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
until nine a.m. ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
so it's not gonna be going to the easiest way since it's not going to Bath or Corning ,,INFO
oh okay ,,CAT
okay okay I see what you're saying okay good ,,CAT
okay so um need to get two boxcars of oranges to Avon ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
through Dansville ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
um let me see where are the oranges oranges are in Corning ,,INFO
right ,,CAT
um there are three boxcars in Dansville ,,INFO
yep ,,CAT
um ,,CAT
oh there's also two in Elmira ,,INFO
two in Elmira oh um hm okay ,,CAT
so all that we need is two boxcars of oranges right ,,INFO
yes ,,CAT
okay ,,CAT
um which is the shorter distance from Dansville to Corning or Elmira to Corning ,,QUESTION
it's actually only one hour from Corning to Dansville but the thing is is that we don't have an engine in Dansville anyways right ,,INFO
oh okay ,,CAT
so ,,CAT
alright so uh from Elmira we'll bring uh two boxcars ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
with engine E two ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
to Corning ,,INFO
okay so that'll get to Corning at two a.m. ,,INFO
mm-hm and then we will put uh fill the boxcars with oranges ,,INFO
okay so that'll be three a.m. then ,,CAT
then take the two boxcars through Dansville to Avon ,,COMMAND
okay um so from Corning to Dansville was one hour ,,INFO
mm-hm ,,CAT
okay so that was so we'll get to Dansville about four a.m. now the other problem is is that if we have this train so we also have engine E one that's going back and forth right ,,INFO
oh right that's true ,,CAT
okay so I'm wondering if we're gonna um so we have to make sure that we don't run into that train ,,INFO
mm-hm ,,CAT
so if we get to Dansville at four a.m. so engine E one is going back and forth starting at midnight till nine a.m. ,,INFO
mm-hm ,,CAT
bringing okay so it must so from so from midnight to nine a.m. it's going back and forth ,,INFO
mm-hm ,,CAT
oh okay ,,CAT
what is it going back and forth on just an engine can we use that engine ,,QUESTION
yeah so what we could do is is that if it well it's gonna get to so it gets to Avon so it starts at Avon right so at three a.m. it'll get to Dansville ,,INFO
then it must drop off then maybe it unloads the oranges I'm not s(ure)- uh the the bananas ,,INFO
um picks up boxcars in Dansville ,,COMMAND
yep ,,CAT
and then continually runs back and forth between Avon and Dansville ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
carrying three boxcars of bananas to Dansville on every trip ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
okay ,,CAT
so it's it ,,CAT
and that runs until what time ,,QUESTION
until nine a.m. ,,INFO
okay so at three a.m. it would get to Dansville it would pick up the three boxcars and then go back to Avon ,,INFO
n- no it would uh it will be carrying three box of bananas to Dansville ,,INFO
right to Dansville okay ,,CAT
so it will be returning to Avon empty ,,QUESTION
right okay so we could actually have it so we're not gonna get to Dansville until four a.m. ,,INFO
so we would have missed it when it was there at three a.m. ,,INFO
mm-hm ,,CAT
so we could just probably so now the th- so what we're probably gonna have to do is to actually wait at Dansville until it next comes ,,INFO
right ,,CAT
okay ,,CAT
okay ,,CAT
so which will probably be around um so it must have it must load the bananas into those three boxcars ,,INFO
so it would leave Avon at seven ,,INFO
and get to Dansville or actually the other thing is is that why don't we just um go via Bath to to Avon ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
even though that route's a bit longer at least then we don't have any conflict ,,INFO
it will save time ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
yeah because then so if we get to c- so we were at Corning at so we had the boxcars loaded up at three a.m. ,,INFO
so we go to Bath that'll be five a.m. we go to Avon that'll be nine a.m. ,,INFO
mm-hm ,,CAT
right ,,CAT
so we'll get there at nine a.m. ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
okay ,,CAT
,,
oh  uh  hello can I help you,,G_G
uh-huh  okay sure  um   okay I've gotta determine the maximum number of boxcars of oranges  that I can get to Bath  by seven a.m. tomorrow morning    okay ,,INFO
Bath  by seven a.m. ,,INFO
yeah  alright  um    I guess the first thing I do is take  engine two  and  the two boxcars  from  Elmira ,,INFO
mm-hm ,,CAT
um    go to Corning t-  two hours ,,INFO
right,,CAT
okay  um  from Corn-  go to Dansville  to pick up  the other three boxcars  which would  be,,COMMAND
okay,,CAT
um  hm I don't know if the  okay that'll be three hours right  I have  five box- ,,INFO
oh let's  see  um  right ,,CAT
does it  take any time to  hook up the boxcars ,,QUESTION
uh no ,,CAT
okay  so I'd have five boxcars in Dansville after  at three a.m.    okay so I drive an hour back to Corning ,,INFO
okay ,,CAT
um  which would make it  what four a.m.,,INFO
right,,CAT
with five  boxcars  an hour to fill up  this  does it still take the same amount of time with   five box-,,QUESTION
right,,CAT
okay,,CAT
so that would bring us to five a.m.  and then two hours to Bath ,,INFO
okay,,CAT
that give us ,,CAT
uh there's  a  problem that  uh  an engine can only  pull three loaded boxcars  at a time ,,INFO
oh it can only pull three loaded boxcars ,,CAT
yeah  and any number of unloaded boxcars ,,INFO
okay,,CAT
so when you made the o-  orange juice at Corning you wouldn't  uh be able to  um  pull all  of them out ,,INFO
okay well ,,CAT
  okay when I filled them up at Corning  I could send engine three  from Elmira to Corning at that point cause the track would be clear right ,,INFO
right,,CAT
and it could pick up the other two boxcars ,,INFO
mm-hm ,,CAT
that are full   that engine  two couldn't take ,,INFO
right,,CAT
um    but then they both couldn't go to Bath  could they ,,QUESTION
um  not at the same time ,,CAT
okay  okay I see alright  I know what I gotta do ,,CAT
alright so uh  alright I'm gonna have engine two  go through then and pick up the  um the boxcars  in Dansville ,,INFO
okay,,CAT
like we planned on doing except he's not gonna take the original two boxcars ,,INFO
okay,,CAT
and after he leaves  then engine three can take the two boxcars that are at Elmira ,,INFO
right,,CAT
and fill them up at Corning ,,COMMAND
uh-huh ,,CAT
and take   take them to Bath ,,COMMAND
okay so engine  two will have to leave an hour  after I mean engine three will have to leave an hour after engine two then ,,INFO
yeah correct ,,CAT
okay ,,CAT
okay so  but engine three would still be able to make it to Bath because he's not going through Dansville ,,INFO
right,,CAT
okay so they would  both be taken care of  and then uh ,,CAT
so  engine  two is going  uh  to Corning  to Dansville  pick up three boxcars and back to Corning ,,INFO
right to fill up ,,CAT
right and meanwhile engine three leaves an hour later  gets to Corning the same time that  engine two gets to Dansville ,,INFO
right,,CAT
so engine  three loads   the,,INFO
and l-   and leaves Corning  while the other one's getting  back to Corning,,INFO
so it  so it  loads the oranges while the  while engine two is getting to Corning and then it  goes on to Bath  um  while engine  two  is loading,,INFO
is  is  loading  right ,,CAT
okay and then engine two follows,,CAT
okay ,,CAT
alright,,CAT
and   I  don't believe that in the seven hours we can fit engine one  into the  equation here  without running over the same tracks ,,INFO
uh,,CAT
or maybe if,,CAT
well from engine one the  the quickest way  to  Corning    yeah that would be four hours already ,,INFO
 be at Dansville ,,COMMAND
right so that's not gonna be possible ,,INFO
um ,,CAT
to pick up bopf-  pick up boxcars fill them and bring them back   so we can't ,,INFO
the  the  only other boxcars are at Bath ,,INFO
right ,,CAT
and that's   that's too far ,,INFO
yeah  okay so we're all done ,,CAT
um,,CAT
is that right or ,,QUESTION
well I'm wonder(ing)- I'm just wondering ,,CAT
I don't think there's any way to incorporate those other two boxcars is there ,,QUESTION
I'm wondering if we take  engine one  have engine one take the boxcars  at Dansville ,,INFO
from  from   Dansville,,CAT
and  um  try to send   engine two  to Bath ,,COMMAND
um,,CAT
uh,,CAT
okay well engine one it's four hours from  Avon to Dansville ,,INFO
uh yeah ,,CAT
and  then ,,QUESTION
well three  hours from Avon to Dansville ,,INFO
okay three hours  and then an hour to Corning so  that's four ,,INFO
right,,CAT
an hour to fill up is five  okay and two hours to Bath is seven ,,INFO
right,,CAT
okay so we could do that ,,INFO
okay,,CAT
now  the  question is whether  can  engine two  to Corning  would be two hours then to Bath would be four hours picking up the boxcar and back would be six no there's no way to ,,INFO
 no I don't think   I think ,,CAT
to go  back to Bath ,,INFO
yes,,CAT
no   I think  five  boxcars is the top ,,INFO
s- ,,CAT
